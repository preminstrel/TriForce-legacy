It is a handsome building, surrounded by a\\nfinely timbered park of some extent, and, what is more important, by\\nabout 12,000 acres of land, which also appertain to it.  At the period\\nin which I commence this history, there resided in this mansion an\\nelderly spinster of rank, named the Honourable Miss Delmar, sister of\\nthe late Lord de Versely and aunt to the present earl, and an Honourable\\nCaptain Delmar, who was the second son of the deceased nobleman.  This\\nproperty belonged to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was at her entire\\ndisposal upon her decease.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar, at the time I am speaking of, commanded a\\nfrigate employed upon what was designated channel service, which in\\nthose days implied that the captain held a seat in the House of Commons\\nand that he voted with the ministry; and further, that his vote might,\\nwhen required, be forthcoming, the frigate was never sea-going, except\\nduring the recess.  It must be admitted that H.M. ship Paragon did\\noccasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for\\ntwo or three days, until the steward reported that the milk provided for\\nthe captain\\'s table was turning sour; upon which important information\\nthe helm was immediately put up, and the frigate, in a case of such\\nextreme distress, would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her\\nlee.  Now as the Paragon was constantly at Spithead, Captain Delmar was\\nvery attentive in visiting his aunt, who lived at Madeline Hall;\\nill-natured people asserted, because she had so fine an estate in her\\nown gift.  Certain it is, that he would remain there for weeks, which\\ngave great satisfaction to the old lady, who liked her nephew, liked\\nattention, and was even so peculiar as to like sailors.  But it must be\\nobserved that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the\\ncaptain, liked attention, and liked sailors; this was Miss Arabella\\nMason, a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age, who\\nconstantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seen\\na face which she preferred to her own, and who never read any novel\\nwithout discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the\\nheroine and her pretty self.\\n\\nMiss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old\\nLord de Versely, brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was much\\nrespected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of\\nbusiness, in the transaction of which he fell, for he was felling trees,\\nand a tree fell upon him.  He left a widow and two daughters: it was\\nsaid that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off, as her husband had\\nbeen very careful of his earnings.  Mrs Mason, however, did not\\ncorroborate this statement; on the contrary, she invariably pleaded\\npoverty; and the Honourable Miss Delmar, after Lord de Versely\\'s death--\\nwhich happened soon after that of his steward--sent both the daughters\\nto be educated at a country school, where, as everything that is taught\\nis second-rate, young ladies, of course, receive a second-rate\\neducation.  Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar\\nto spend a month at Madeline Hall, and used to bring her eldest\\ndaughter, who had left school, with her.  Latterly, however, the\\ndaughter remained as a fixture, and Mrs Mason received but an\\noccasional invitation.  It may be inquired in what capacity Miss\\nArabella Mason remained at the Hall; she was not a servant, for her\\nposition in life was above that of a menial; neither was she received\\naltogether in the saloon, as she was of too humble a grade to mix with\\ngentry and nobility; she was, therefore, betwixt and between, a sort of\\nhumble companion in the drawing-room, a cut above the housekeeper in the\\nstill-room, a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinster\\'s wishes, a\\nsort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants,\\ntowards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion.  However this\\nposition might be found useful to her mistress, it must be admitted that\\nit was a most unfortunate position for a young, thoughtless, and very\\npretty girl, moreover, who was naturally very lively, very smart in\\nrepartee, and very fond of being admired.\\n\\nAs the Honourable Captain Delmar was very constant in his visits to his\\naunt, it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her\\nhumble companion.  By degrees the intimacy increased, and at last there\\nwere reports in the servants\\' hall, that the captain and Miss Bella\\nMason had been seen together in the evergreen walk; and as the captain\\'s\\nvisits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did\\nthe scandal increase, and people became more ill-natured.  It was now\\nseen that Miss Bella had been very often found in tears, and the old\\nbutler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like\\nresponsive mandarins; the only person who was ignorant of the scandal\\nafloat was the old lady spinster herself.\\n\\nI must now introduce another personage.  The Honourable Captain Delmar\\ndid not, of course, travel without his valet, and this important\\npersonage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been\\ndrafted into the frigate.  Benjamin Keene, for such was his name, was\\ncertainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a\\nvalet; he was very clean in his person, very respectful in his\\ndeportment, and, after the sovereign of Great Britain, looked upon the\\nHonourable Captain Delmar as the greatest person in the world.\\nMoreover, Benjamin Keene, although only a private marine was, without\\nexception, one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being\\nequally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person, he\\nwas the admiration of all the young women.  But Nature, who delights in\\na drawback, had contrived to leave him almost without brains; and\\nfurther, he was wholly uneducated--for he was too stupid to learn--his\\nfaculties were just sufficient to enable him, by constant drilling, to\\nbe perfect in the manual exercise, and mechanically to perform his\\nduties as a valet.\\n\\nBen always accompanied his master to the hall, where the former was at\\none and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants.\\nIt hardly need be observed, that the clever and sprightly Miss Arabella\\nMason considered Ben as one much beneath her, that is, she said so on\\nhis first arrival at Madeline hall; but, strange to say, that two years\\nafterwards, just at the time that reports had been raised that she had\\nbeen frequently discovered in tears, there was a change in her manner\\ntowards him; indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap\\nat the handsome marine: this idea, it is true, was ridiculed by the\\nmajority; but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase.  It was\\nafterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken\\nplace, that Ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal\\nmatch had he not been prompted to it by his master, who actually\\nproposed that he should marry the girl.  That such was the fact is\\nundoubted, although they knew it not; and Ben, who considered the wish\\nof his captain as tantamount to an order, as soon as he could comprehend\\nwhat his captain required of him, stood up erect and raised his hand\\nwith a flourish to his head, in token of his obedience.  Shortly\\nafterwards, Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall, accompanied\\nas usual, by Ben, and the second day after their arrival it was made\\nknown to all whom it might concern, that Miss Arabella Mason had\\nactually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene.\\n\\nOf course, the last person made acquainted with this interesting\\nintelligence was the Honourable Miss Delmar, and her nephew took upon\\nhimself to make the communication.  At first the honourable spinster\\nbridled up with indignation, wondered at the girl\\'s indelicacy, and much\\nmore at her demeaning herself by marrying a private marine.  Captain\\nDelmar replied, that it was true that Ben was only a private, but that\\nevery common soldier was a gentleman by profession.  It was true that\\nBella Mason might have done better--but she was his aunt\\'s servant, and\\nKeene was his valet, so that the disparity was not so very great.  He\\nthen intimated that he had long perceived the growing attachment; talked\\nof the danger of young people being left so much together; hinted about\\nopportunity, and descanted upon morals and propriety.  The Honourable\\nMiss Delmar was softened down by the dexterous reasoning of her nephew;\\nshe was delighted to find so much virtue extant in a sailor; and, after\\nan hour\\'s conversation, the married couple were sent for, graciously\\npardoned, and Mrs Keene, after receiving a very tedious lecture,\\nreceived a very handsome present.  But if her mistress was appeased,\\nMrs Keene\\'s mother was not.  As soon as the intelligence was received,\\nold Mrs Mason set off for Madeline Hall.  She first had a closeted\\ninterview with her daughter, and then with Captain Delmar, and as soon\\nas the latter was over, she immediately took her departure, without\\npaying her respects to the mistress of the Hall, or exchanging one word\\nwith any of the servants; this conduct gave occasion to more\\ninnuendoes--some indeed ascribed her conduct to mortification at her\\ndaughter\\'s having made so imprudent a match, but others exchanged very\\nsignificant glances.\\n\\nThree weeks after the marriage, the Parliament having been prorogued,\\nthe admiral of the port considered that he was justified in ordering the\\nfrigate out on a cruise.  Ben Keene, of course accompanied his master,\\nand it was not until three months had passed away that the frigate\\nreturned into port.  As usual, the Honourable Captain Delmar, as soon as\\nhe had paid his respects to the admiral, set off to visit his aunt,\\naccompanied by his benedict marine.  On his arrival, he found that\\neverything appeared to be in great confusion; indeed an event was\\noccurring which had astonished the whole household; the butler made a\\nprofound bow to the captain; the footmen forgot their usual smirk when\\nhe alighted.  Captain Delmar was ushered in solemn silence into the\\ndrawing-room, and his aunt, who had notice of his arrival received him\\nwith a stiff, prim air of unwonted frigidity, with her arms crossed\\nbefore her on her white muslin apron.\\n\\n\"My dear aunt,\" said Captain Delmar, as she coldly took his proffered\\nhand, \"what is the matter?\"\\n\\n\"The matter is this, nephew,\" replied the old lady--\"that marriage of\\nyour marine and Bella Mason should have taken place six months sooner\\nthan it did.  This is a wicked world, nephew; and sailors, I\\'m afraid,\\nare--\"\\n\\n\"Marines, you should say, in this instance, my dear aunt,\" replied\\nCaptain Delmar, insinuatingly.  \"I must confess that neither sailors nor\\nmarines are quite so strict as they ought to be; however, Ben has\\nmarried her.  Come, my dear aunt, allow me to plead for them, although I\\nam very much distressed that such an event should take place in your\\nhouse.  I think,\" added he, after a pause, \"I shall give Mr Keene seven\\ndozen at the gangway, for his presumption, as soon as I return on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t mend the matter, nephew,\" replied Miss Delmar.  \"I\\'ll turn\\nher out of the house as soon as she can be moved.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll flog him as soon as I get him on board,\" rejoined the captain.\\n\"I will not have your feelings shocked, and your mind harassed in this\\nway, by any impropriety on the part of my followers--most infamous--\\nshameful--abominable--unpardonable,\" interjected the captain, walking\\nthe quarter-deck up and down the room.\\n\\nThe Honourable Miss Delmar continued to talk, and the honourable captain\\nto agree with her in all she said, for an hour at least.  When people\\nare allowed to give vent to their indignation without the smallest\\nopposition they soon talk it away; such was the case with the Honourable\\nMiss Delmar.  When it was first announced that Bella Keene was safely in\\nbed with a fine boy, the offended spinster turned away from the\\ncommunication with horror; when her own maid ventured to remark that it\\nwas a lovely baby, she was ordered to hold her tongue; she would not see\\nthe suffering mother, and the horrid marine was commanded to stay in the\\nkitchen, lest she should be contaminated by meeting him on the stairs;\\nbut every day softened down her indignation, and before a fortnight was\\nover the Honourable Miss Delmar had not only seen but admired the baby;\\nand at last decided upon paying a visit to the mother, who was now\\nsufficiently recovered to undergo a lecture of about two hours\\' length,\\nin which the honourable spinster commented upon her _in_decency,\\n_in_discretion, _in_considerateness, _in_correctness, _in_decorum,\\n_in_continence, and _in_delicacy; pointing out that her conduct was most\\ninexcusable, iniquitous, and most infamous.  The Honourable Miss Delmar\\nhaving had such a long innings then gave it up, because she was out of\\nbreath.  Bella, who waited patiently to make her response, and who was a\\nvery clever girl, then declared, with many tears, that she was aware\\nthat her conduct was _in_excusable, her faults had been _in_voluntary,\\nand her sorrow was _in_expressible; her _in_experience and her\\n_in_fatuation her only apology; that her _in_felicity at her mistress\\'s\\ndispleasure would _in_evitably increase her sufferings; assured her that\\nshe was not _in_corrigible, and that if her mistress would only indulge\\nher with forgiveness, as she hoped to _in_herit heaven she would never\\n_in_cur her anger by committing the same fault again.  Satisfied with\\nthis assurance, the Honourable Miss Delmar softened down, and not only\\nforgave, but actually took the child into her lap that Bella might read\\nthe Bible which she had presented her with.  Reader, the child who had\\nthis great honour conferred upon him, who actually laid in the\\nimmaculate lap, on the apron of immaculate snowy whiteness of the\\nimmaculate Honourable Miss Delmar, was no other person than the narrator\\nof this history--or, if you please it, the Hero of this Tale.\\n\\nThat my mother had so far smoothed things pretty well must be\\nacknowledged; but it was to be presumed that her husband might not be\\npleased at so unusual an occurrence, and already the sneers and\\ninnuendoes of the servants\\' hall were not wanting.  It appeared,\\nhowever, that an interview had taken place between Ben and Captain\\nDelmar shortly after my making my appearance: what occurred did not\\ntranspire, but this is certain that, upon the marine\\'s return to the\\nkitchen, one of the grooms, who ventured to banter him, received such a\\nsound thrashing from Ben that it put an end to all further joking.  As\\nBen had taken up the affair so seriously, it was presumed that if there\\nhad been anticipation of the hymeneal rites he was himself the party who\\nhad been hasty; and that now he was married, he was resolved to resent\\nany impertinent remarks upon his conduct.  At all events, the question\\nnow became one of less interest, as the scandal was of less importance;\\nand as Ben had made known his determination to resent any remarks upon\\nthe subject, not a word more was said, at all events when he was\\npresent.\\n\\nIn due time I was christened, and so completely was my mother\\nreinstalled in the good graces of her mistress, that as Captain Delmar\\nhad volunteered to stand my sponsor, the Honourable Miss Delmar gave the\\nnecessary female security; at the particular request of my mother, the\\ncaptain consented that I should bear his own Christian name, and I was\\nduly registered in the church books as Percival Keene.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO.\\n\\nThere is no security in this world.  A dissolution of Parliament took\\nplace, and on the following election the Honourable Captain Delmar\\'s\\nconstituents, not being exactly pleased at the total indifference which\\nhe had shown to their interests, took upon themselves to elect another\\nmember in his stead, who, as Captain Delmar had previously done,\\npromised everything, and in all probability would follow the honourable\\ncaptain\\'s example by performing nothing.  The loss of his election was\\nfollowed up by the loss of his ship, his majesty\\'s government not\\nconsidering it necessary that Captain Delmar (now that he had leisure to\\nattend to his professional duties) should retain his command.  The\\nfrigate, therefore, was paid off, and recommissioned by another captain\\nwho had friends in Parliament.\\n\\nAs Ben Keene belonged to the marine corps, he could not, of course,\\nremain as valet to Captain Delmar, but was ordered, with the rest of the\\ndetachment, to the barracks at Chatham; my mother, although she was\\ndetermined that she would not live at barracks, was not sorry to leave\\nthe Hall, where she could not fail to perceive that she was, from her\\nimprudent conduct, no longer treated with the respect or cordiality to\\nwhich she had been previously accustomed.  She was most anxious to quit\\na place in which her disgrace was so well known; and Captain Delmar\\nhaving given her his advice, which coincided with her own ideas, and\\nalso a very munificent present to enable her to set up housekeeping,\\ntook his departure from the Hall.  My mother returned to her room as the\\nwheels of his carriage rattled over the gravel of the drive, and many\\nwere the bitter tears which she shed over her unconscious boy.\\n\\nThe following day the Honourable Miss Delmar sent for her; as usual,\\ncommenced with a tedious lecture, which, as before, was wound up at\\nparting with a handsome present.  The day after my mother packed up her\\ntrunks, and with me in her arms set off to Chatham, where we arrived\\nsafely, and immediately went into furnished lodgings.  My mother was a\\nclever, active woman, and the presents which she had at different times\\nreceived amounted to a considerable sum of money, over which her husband\\nhad never ventured to assert any claim.\\n\\nIndeed, I must do Ben Keene the justice to say that he had the virtue of\\nhumility.  He felt that his wife was in every way his superior and that\\nit was only under peculiar circumstances that he could have aspired to\\nher.  He was, therefore, submissive to her in everything, consenting to\\nevery proposal that was made by her, and guided by her opinion.  When,\\ntherefore, on her arrival at Chatham, she pointed out how impossible it\\nwould be for one brought up as she had been to associate with the women\\nin the barracks, and that she considered it advisable that she should\\nset up some business by which she might gain a respectable livelihood,\\nBen, although he felt that this would be a virtual separation _a mensa\\net thoro_, named no objections.  Having thus obtained the consent of her\\nhusband, who considered her so much his superior as to be infallible, my\\nmother, after much cogitation, resolved that she would embark her\\ncapital in a circulating library and stationer\\'s shop; for she argued\\nthat selling paper, pens, and sealing-wax was a commerce which would\\nsecure to her customers of the better class.  Accordingly, she hired a\\nhouse close to the barracks, with a very good-sized shop below, painting\\nand papering it very smartly; there was much taste in all her\\narrangements, and although the expenses of the outlay and the first\\nyear\\'s rent had swallowed up a considerable portion of the money she had\\nlaid by, it soon proved that she had calculated well, and her shop\\nbecame a sort of lounge for the officers, who amused themselves with her\\nsmartness and vivacity, the more so as she had a talent for repartee,\\nwhich men like to find in a very pretty woman.\\n\\nIn a short time my mother became quite the rage, and it was a mystery\\nhow so pretty and elegant a person could have become the wife of a\\nprivate marine.  It was however, ascribed to her having been captivated\\nwith the very handsome person and figure of her husband, and having\\nyielded to her feelings in a moment of infatuation.  The ladies\\npatronised her circulating library; the officers and gentlemen purchased\\nher stationery.  My mother then added gloves, perfumery, canes, and\\nlastly cigars, to her previous assortment and before she had been a year\\nin business, found that she was making money very fast, and increasing\\nher customers every day.  My mother had a great deal of tact; with the\\nother sex she was full of merriment and fond of joking, consequently a\\ngreat favourite; towards her own sex her conduct was quite the reverse;\\nshe assumed a respectful, prudish air, blended with a familiarity which\\nwas never offensive; she was, therefore, equally popular with her own\\nsex, and prospered in every sense of the word.  Had her husband been the\\nleast inclined to have asserted his rights, the position which she had\\ngained was sufficient to her reducing him to a state of subjection.  She\\nhad raised herself, unaided, far above him; he saw her continually\\nchatting and laughing with his own officers, to whom he was compelled to\\nmake a respectful salute whenever they passed by him; he could not\\nventure to address her, or even to come into the shop, when his officers\\nwere there, or it would have been considered disrespectful towards them;\\nand as he could not sleep out of barracks, all his intercourse with her\\nwas to occasionally slink down by the area, to find something better to\\neat than he could have in his own mess, or obtain from her an occasional\\nshilling to spend in beer.  Ben, the marine, found at last that somehow\\nor another, his wife had slipped out of his hands; that he was nothing\\nmore than a pensioner on her bounty a slave to her wishes, and a fetcher\\nand carrier at her command, and he resigned himself quietly to his fate,\\nas better men have done before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE.\\n\\nI think that the reader will agree with me that my mother showed in her\\nconduct great strength of character.  She had been compelled to marry a\\nman whom she despised, and to whom she felt herself superior in every\\nrespect; she had done so to save her reputation.  That she had been in\\nerror is true but situation and opportunity had conspired against her;\\nand when she found out the pride and selfishness of the man to whom she\\nwas devoted, and for whom she had sacrificed so much,--when her ears\\nwere wounded by proposals from his lips that she should take such a step\\nto avoid the scandal arising from their intimacy--when at the moment\\nthat he made such a proposition, and the veil fell down and revealed the\\nheart of man in its selfishness, it is not to be wondered that, with\\nbitter tears, arising from wounded love, anger, and despair at her\\nhopeless position, she consented.  After having lost all she valued,\\nwhat did she care for the future?  It was but one sacrifice more to\\nmake, one more proof of her devotion and obedience.  But there are few\\nwomen who, like my mother, would have recovered her position to the\\nextent that she did.  Had she not shown such determination, had she\\nconsented to have accompanied her husband to the barracks, and have\\nmixed up with the other wives of the men, she would have gradually sunk\\ndown to their level; to this she could not consent.  Having once freed\\nherself from her thraldom, he immediately sunk down to his level, as she\\nrose up to a position in which, if she could not ensure more than\\ncivility and protection, she was at all events secure from insult and\\nill-treatment.\\n\\nSuch was the state of affairs when I had arrived at the important age of\\nsix years, a comic-looking, laughing urchin, petted by the officers, and\\nas fall of mischief as a tree full of monkeys.  My mother\\'s business had\\nso much increased, that, about a year previous to this date, she had\\nfound it necessary to have some one to assist her, and had decided upon\\nsending for her sister Amelia to live with her.  It was, however,\\nnecessary to obtain her mother\\'s consent.  My grandmother had never seen\\nmy mother since the interview which she had had with her at Madeline\\nHall shortly after her marriage with Ben the marine.  Latterly, however,\\nthey had corresponded; for my mother, who was too independent to seek\\nher mother when she was merely the wife of a private marine, now that\\nshe was in flourishing circumstances had first tendered the olive\\nbranch, which had been accepted, as soon as my grandmother found that\\nshe was virtually separated from her husband.  As my grandmother found\\nit rather lonely at the isolated house in which she resided, and Amelia\\ndeclared herself bored to death, it was at last agreed that my\\ngrandmother and my aunt Amelia should both come and take up their\\nresidence with my mother, and in due time they arrived.  Milly, as my\\naunt was called, was three years younger than my mother, very pretty and\\nas smart as her sister, perhaps a little more demure in her look, but\\nwith more mischief in her disposition.  My grandmother was a cross,\\nspiteful old woman; she was very large in her person, but very\\nrespectable in her appearance.  I need not say that Miss Amelia did not\\nlessen the attraction at the circulating library, which after her\\narrival was even more frequented by the officers than before.\\n\\nMy aunt Milly was very soon as fond of me as I was of mischief; indeed\\nit is not to be wondered at, for I was a type of the latter.  I soon\\nloved her better than my mother, for she encouraged me in all my tricks.\\nMy mother looked grave, and occasionally scolded me; my grandmother\\nslapped me hard and rated me continually; but reproof or correction from\\nthe two latter were of no avail; and the former, when she wished to play\\nany trick which she dared not do herself, employed me as her agent; so\\nthat I obtained the whole credit for what were her inventions, and I may\\nsafely add, underwent the whole blame and punishment; but that I cared\\nnothing for; her caresses, cakes, and sugar-plums, added to my natural\\npropensity, more than repaid me for the occasional severe rebukes of my\\nmother, and the vindictive blows I received from the long fingers of my\\nworthy grandmother.  Moreover, the officers took much notice of me, and\\nit must be admitted, that, although I positively refused to learn my\\nletters, I was a very forward child.  My great patron was a Captain\\nBridgeman, a very thin, elegantly-made man, who was continually\\nperforming feats of address and activity; occasionally I would escape\\nwith him and go down to the mess, remain at dinner, drink toasts, and,\\nstanding on the mess-table, sing two or three comic songs which he had\\ntaught me.  I sometimes returned a little merry with the bumpers, which\\nmade my mother very angry, my old grandmother to hold up her hands, and\\nlook at the ceiling through her spectacles, and my aunt Milly as merry\\nas myself.  Before I was eight years old, I had become so notorious,\\nthat any prank played in the town, any trick undiscovered, was\\ninvariably laid to my account; and many were the applications made to my\\nmother for indemnification for broken windows and other damage done, too\\noften, I grant, with good reason, but very often when I had been\\nperfectly innocent of the misdemeanour.  At last I was voted a common\\nnuisance, and every one, except my mother and my aunt Milly, declared\\nthat it was high time that I went to school.\\n\\nOne evening the whole of the family were seated at tea in the back\\nparlour.  I was sitting very quietly and demurely in a corner, a sure\\nsign that I was in mischief, and so indeed I was (for I was putting a\\nlittle gunpowder into my grandmother\\'s snuff-box, which I had purloined,\\njust that she might \"smell powder,\" as they say at sea, without danger\\nof life or limb), when the old woman addressed my mother--\\n\\n\"Bella, is that boy never going to school? it will be the ruin of him.\"\\n\\n\"What will be the ruin of him, mother?\" rejoined my aunt Milly; \"going\\nto school?\"\\n\\n\"Hold your nonsense, child: you are as bad as the boy himself,\" replied\\ngranny.  \"Boys are never ruined by education; girls sometimes are.\"\\n\\nWhether my mother thought that this was an innuendo reflecting upon any\\nportion of her own life, I cannot tell; but she replied very tartly.\\n\\n\"You\\'re none the worse for my education, mother, or you would not be\\nsitting here.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, child,\" replied granny; \"but recollect, neither would you\\nhave married a marine--a private marine, Bella, while your sister looks\\nup to the officers.  Ay,\" continued the old woman, leaving off her\\nknitting and looking at her daughter, \"and is likely to get one, too, if\\nshe plays her cards well--that Lieutenant Flat can\\'t keep out of the\\nshop.\"  (My granny having at this moment given me an opportunity to\\nreplace her snuff-box, I did not fail to profit by it; and as I\\nperceived her knitting-pin had dropped on the floor, I stuck it into the\\nskirt of her gown behind, so that whenever she looked for it, it was\\ncertain ever to be behind her.)\\n\\n\"Mr Flat is of a very respectable family, I hear say,\" continued my\\ngrandmother.\\n\\n\"And a great fool,\" interrupted my mother.  \"I hope Milly won\\'t listen\\nto him.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s an officer,\" replied my granny, \"not a private.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I prefer my private marine, for I can make him do as I\\nplease; if he\\'s a private, I\\'m commanding officer, and intend so to be\\nas long as I live.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, Bella, let us say no more on the old score; but that boy\\nmust go to school.  Deary me, I have dropped my needle.\"\\n\\nMy grandmother rose, and turned round and round, looking for her needle,\\nwhich, strange to say, she could not find; she opened her snuff-box, and\\ntook a pinch to clear her optics.  \"Deary me, why, what\\'s the matter\\nwith my snuff? and where can that needle be?  Child, come and look for\\nthe needle; don\\'t be sticking there in that corner.\"\\n\\nI thought proper to obey the order and pretended to be very diligent in\\nmy search.  Catching aunt Milly\\'s eye, I pointed to the knitting-needle\\nsticking in the hind skirts of my grandmother\\'s gown, and then was down\\non my knees again, while my aunt held her handkerchief to her mouth to\\ncheck her laughter.\\n\\nA minute afterwards, Ben the marine first tapped gently, and then opened\\nthe door and came in; for at that late hour the officers were all at\\ndinner, and the shop empty.\\n\\n\"There are three parcels of books for you to take,\" said my mother; \"but\\nyou\\'ve plenty of time, so take down the tea-things, and get your tea in\\nthe kitchen before you go.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t got a shilling, Bella, about you?  I want some \\'baccy,\"\\nsaid Ben, in his quiet way.\\n\\n\"Yes, here\\'s a shilling, Ben; but don\\'t drink too much beer,\" replied my\\nmother.\\n\\n\"Deary me, what can have become of my needle?\" exclaimed my grandmother,\\nturning round.\\n\\n\"Here it is, ma\\'am,\" said Ben, who perceived it sticking in her skirt.\\n\"That\\'s Percival\\'s work, I\\'ll answer for it.\"\\n\\nMy granny received the needle from Ben, and then turned to me: \"You\\ngood-for-nothing boy; so you put the needle there, did you? pretending\\nto look for it all the while; you shall go to school, sir, that you\\nshall.\"\\n\\n\"You said a needle, granny; I was looking for a needle: you didn\\'t say\\nyour knitting-pin; I could have told you where that was.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, those who hide can find; to school you go, or I\\'ll not stay\\nin the house.\"\\n\\nBen took the tea-tray out of the room.  He had been well drilled in and\\nout of barracks.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go down in the kitchen to father,\" cried I, for I was tired of\\nsitting still.\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t, sir,\" said my mother, \"you naughty boy; the kitchen is\\nnot the place for you, and if ever I hear of you smoking a pipe again--\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman smokes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, he smokes cigars; but a child like you must not smoke a\\npipe.\"\\n\\n\"And now come here, sir,\" said my granny, who had the lid of her\\nsnuff-box off, and held it open in her hand; \"what have you been doing\\nwith my snuff?\"\\n\\n\"Why, granny, have I had your snuff-box the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"How should I know?--a boy like you, with every finger a fish-hook; I do\\nbelieve you have; I only wish I could find you out.  I had fresh snuff\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps they made a mistake at the shop, mother,\" said aunt Milly;\\n\"they are very careless.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can\\'t tell: I must have some more; I can\\'t take this.\"\\n\\n\"Throw it in the fire, granny,\" said I; \"and I\\'ll run with the box and\\nget it full again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it\\'s the best thing I can do,\" replied the old woman,\\nwho went to the grate, and leaning over, poured the snuff out on the\\nlive coals.  The result was a loud explosion and a volume of smoke,\\nwhich burst out of the grate into her face--the dinner and lappets\\nsinged, her spectacles lifted from her nose, and her face as black as a\\nsweep\\'s.  The old woman screamed, and threw herself back; in so doing,\\nshe fell over the chair upon which she had been sitting, and, somehow or\\nanother, tripped me up, and lay with all her weight upon me.  I had been\\njust attempting to make my escape during the confusion--for my mother\\nand Milly were equally frightened--when I found myself completely\\nsmothered by the weight of my now almost senseless granny, and, as I\\nhave before mentioned, she was a very corpulent woman.  Had I been in\\nany other position I should not have suffered so much; but I had\\nunfortunately fallen flat on my back, and was now lying with my face\\nupwards, pressed upon by the broadest part of the old woman\\'s body; my\\nnose was flattened, and my breath completely stopped.  How long my\\ngranny might have remained there groaning I cannot tell; probably, as I\\nwas somewhat a spoiled child before this, it might have ended in her\\ncompletely finishing me; but she was roused up from her state of half\\nsyncope by a vigorous attack from my teeth, which, in the agony of\\nsuffocation, I used with preternatural force of jaw from one so young.\\nI bit right through everything she had on, and as my senses were fast\\ndeparting, my teeth actually met with my convulsive efforts.  My granny,\\nroused by the extreme pain, rolled over on her side, and then it was\\nthat my mother and aunt, who supposed that I had made my escape from the\\nroom, discovered me lifeless, and black in the face.  They ran to me,\\nbut I still held on with my teeth, nor could I be separated from my now\\nscreaming relative, until the admission of fresh air, and a plentiful\\nsprinkling of cold water brought me to my senses, when I was laid on the\\nsofa utterly exhausted.  It certainly was a narrow escape, and it may be\\nsaid that the \"biter was nearly bit.\"  As for my granny, she recovered\\nher fright and her legs, but she did not recover her temper; she could\\nnot sit down without a pillow on the chair for many days, and, although\\nlittle was said to me in consequence of the danger I had incurred, yet\\nthere was an evident abhorrence of me on the part of the old woman, a\\nquiet manner about my mother, and a want of her usual hilarity on the\\npart of my aunt, which were to me a foreboding of something unpleasant.\\nA few days brought to light what was the result of various whisperings\\nand consultations.  It was on a fine Monday morning, that Ben made his\\nappearance at an unusually early hour; my cap was put on my head, my\\ncloak over my shoulders; Ben took me by the hand, having a covered\\nbasket in the other, and I was led away like a lamb to the butcher.  As\\nI went out there was a tear in the eyes of my aunt Milly, a melancholy\\nover the countenance of my mother, and a twinkling expression of\\nsatisfaction in my grandmother\\'s eyes, which even her spectacles could\\nnot conceal from me: the fact was, my grandmother had triumphed, and I\\nwas going to school.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR.\\n\\nAs soon as I was clear of the door, I looked up into Ben\\'s face and\\nsaid, \"Father, where are we going?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied he, \"I am going to take you to school.\"\\n\\n\"School!  What am I going to school for?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"For biting your grandmother, I expect, in the first place, and to get a\\nlittle learning, and a good deal of flogging, if what they say is true!\\nI never was at school myself.\"\\n\\n\"What do you learn, and why are you flogged?\"\\n\\n\"You learn to read, and to write, and to count; I can\\'t do either--\\nmore\\'s the pity; and you are flogged, because without flogging, little\\nboys can\\'t learn anything.\"\\n\\nThis was not a very satisfactory explanation.  I made no further\\ninquiries, and we continued our way in silence until we arrived at the\\nschool door; there was a terrible buzz inside.  Ben tapped, the door\\nopened, and a volume of hot air burst forth, all the fresh air having\\nbeen consumed in repeating the fresh lessons for the day.  Ben walked up\\nbetween the forms, and introduced me to the schoolmaster, whose name was\\nMr Thadeus O\\'Gallagher, a poor scholar from Ireland, who had set up an\\nestablishment at half-a-guinea a quarter for day scholars; he was\\nreckoned a very severe master, and the children were kept in better\\norder in his school than in any other establishment of the kind in the\\ntown; and I presume that my granny had made inquiries to that effect, as\\nthere were one or two schools of the same kind much nearer to my\\nmother\\'s house.  Ben, who probably had a great respect for learning, in\\nconsequence of his having none himself, gave a military salute to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, saying, with his hand still to his hat, \"A new boy, sir,\\ncome to school.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, by the powers! don\\'t I know him?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"it\\'s the\\nyoung gentleman who bit a hole in his grandmother; Master Keene, as they\\ncall him.  Keen teeth, at all events.  Lave him with me; and that\\'s his\\ndinner in the basket I presume; lave that too.  He\\'ll soon be a good\\nboy, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nBen put down the basket, turned on his heel, and left the schoolroom,\\nand me standing by the throne of my future pedagogue--I say throne,\\nbecause he had not a desk, as schoolmasters generally have, but a sort\\nof square dais, about eighteen inches high, on which was placed another\\noblong superstructure of the same height, serving him for a seat; both\\nparts were covered with some patched and torn old drugget, and upon\\nsubsequent examination I found them to consist of three old claret cases\\nwithout covers, which he had probably picked up very cheap; two of them\\nturned upside down, so as to form the lower square, and the third placed\\nin the same way upside down, upon the two lower.  Mr O\\'Gallagher sat in\\ngreat dignity upon the upper one, with his feet on the lower, being thus\\nsufficiently raised upon an eminence to command a view of the whole of\\nhis pupils in every part of the school.  He was not a tall man, but very\\nsquare built, with carroty hair and very bushy red whiskers; to me he\\nappeared a most formidable person, especially when he opened his large\\nmouth and displayed his teeth, when I was reminded of the sign of the\\nRed Lion close to my mother\\'s house.  I certainly never had been before\\nso much awed during my short existence as I was with the appearance of\\nmy pedagogue, who sat before me somewhat in the fashion of a Roman\\ntribune, holding in his hand a short round ruler, as if it were his\\ntruncheon of authority.  I had not been a minute in the school before I\\nobserved him to raise his arm; away went the ruler whizzing through the\\nair, until it hit the skull of the lad for whom it was intended at the\\nother end of the schoolroom.  The boy, who had been talking to his\\nneighbour, rubbed his poll, and whined.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you bring back my ruler, you spalpeen?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\"Be quick, Johnny Target, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nThe boy, who was not a little confused with the blow, sufficiently\\nrecovered his senses to obey the order, and whimpering as he came up,\\nreturned the ruler to the hands of Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"That tongue of yours will get you into more trouble than it will\\nbusiness, I expect, Johnny Target; it\\'s an unruly member, and requires a\\nconstant ruler over it.\"  Johnny Target rubbed his head and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said he, after a short pause, \"did you see what a\\ntundering tump on the head that boy got just now, and do you know what\\nit was for?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your manners, you animal?  No `If you plase.\\'  For the future,\\nyou must not forget to say, `No, sir,\\' or, `No, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\'  D\\'ye\\nmind me--now say yes--what?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what! you little ignoramus; say `yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\' and\\nrecollect, as the parish clerk says, `this is the last time of asking.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! now you see, there\\'s nothing like coming to school--you\\'ve learn\\'t\\nmanners already; and now, to go back again, as to why Johnny Target had\\nthe rap on the head, which brought tears into his eyes?  I\\'ll just tell\\nyou, it was for talking; you see, the first thing for a boy to learn, is\\nto hold his tongue, and that shall be your lesson for the day; you\\'ll\\njust sit down there and if you say one word during the whole time you\\nare in the school, it will end in a blow-up; that means, on the present\\noccasion, that I\\'ll skin you alive as they do the eels, which being\\nrather keen work, will just suit your constitution.\"  I had wit enough\\nto feel assured that Mr O\\'Gallagher was not to be trifled with, so I\\ntook my seat, and amused myself with listening to the various lessons\\nwhich the boys came up to say, and the divers punishments inflicted--few\\nescaped.  At last, the hour of recreation and dinner arrived, the boys\\nwere dismissed, each seized his basket, containing his provisions, or\\nran home to get his meal with his parents: I found myself sitting in the\\nschool-room _tete-a-tete_ with Mr O\\'Gallagher, and feeling very well\\ninclined for my dinner I cast a wistful eye at my basket, but I said\\nnothing; Mr O\\'Gallagher, who appeared to have been in thought, at last\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you may now go out of school, and scream till you\\'re hoarse,\\njust to make up for lost time.\"\\n\\n\"May I take my dinner, sir?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"Is it your dinner you mane?--to be sure you may; but, first, I\\'ll just\\nlook into the basket and its contents; for you see, Mr Keene, there\\'s\\nsome victuals that don\\'t agree with larning; and if you eat them, you\\'ll\\nnot be fit for your work when your play-hours are over.  What\\'s easy of\\ndigestion will do; but what\\'s bad for little boys\\' stomachs may get you\\ninto a scrape, and then it will end in a blow-up; that is, you\\'ll have a\\ntaste of the ferrule or the rod--two assistants of mine, to whom I\\'ve\\nnot yet had the pleasure of introducing you--all in good time.  If what\\nI\\'ve hear of you be true, you and they will be better acquainted afore\\nlong.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher then examined the contents of my basket; my aunt Milly\\nhad taken care that I should be well provided: there was a large paper\\nof beef sandwiches, a piece of bread and cheese, and three or four\\nslices of seed-cake.  Mr O\\'Gallagher opened all the packages, and,\\nafter a pause, said--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, d\\'ye think you would ever guess how I came by all my\\nlarning, and what I fed upon when it was pumped into me?  Then I\\'ll tell\\nyou; it was dry bread, with a little bit of cheese when I could get it,\\nand that wasn\\'t often.  Bread and cheese is the food to make a scholar\\nof ye; and mayhap one slice of the cake mayn\\'t much interfere, so take\\nthem, and run away to the play-ground as fast as you can; and, d\\'ye hear\\nme, Master Keene, recollect your grace before meat--`For what we have\\nreceived, the Lord make us truly thankful.\\'  Now, off wid you.  The rest\\nof the contents are confiscated for my sole use, and your particular\\nbenefit.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher grinned as he finished his oration; and he looked so\\nmuch like a wild beast, that I was glad to be off as fast as I could.  I\\nturned round as I went out of the door, and perceived that the\\nsandwiches were disappearing with wonderful rapidity; but I caught his\\neye: it was like that of a tiger\\'s at his meal, and I was off at\\nredoubled speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE.\\n\\nAs soon as I gained the play-ground, which was, in fact, nothing more\\nthan a small piece of waste land, to which we had no more claim than any\\nother people, I sat down by a post, and commenced my dinner off what Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had thought proper to leave me.  I was afraid of him, it is\\ntrue, for his severity to the other boys convinced me that he would have\\nlittle mercy upon me, if I dared to thwart him; but indignation soon\\nbegan to obtain the mastery over my fears and I began to consider if I\\ncould not be even with him for his barefaced robbery of my dinner; and\\nthen I reflected whether it would not be better to allow him to take my\\nfood if I found out that by so doing he treated me well; and I resolved,\\nat all events, to delay a little.  The hour of play was now over, and a\\nbell summoned us all to school; I went in with the others and took my\\nseat where Mr O\\'Gallagher had before desired me.\\n\\nAs soon as all was silent, my pedagogue beckoned me to him.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"you\\'ll be so good as to lend me your ears--\\nthat is, to listen while I talk to you a little bit.  D\\'ye know how many\\nroads there are to larning?  Hold your tongue.  I ask you because I know\\nyou don\\'t know, and because I\\'m going to tell you.  There are exactly\\nthree roads: the first is the eye, my jewel; and if a lad has a sharp\\neye like yours, it\\'s a great deal that will get into his head by that\\nroad; you\\'ll know a thing when you see it again, although you mayn\\'t\\nknow your own father--that\\'s a secret only known to your mother.  The\\nsecond road to larning, young spalpeen, is the ear; and if you mind all\\npeople say, and hear all you can, you\\'ll gain a great many truths and\\njust ten times as much more in the shape of lies.  You see the wheat and\\nthe chaff will come together, and you must pick the latter out of the\\nformer at any seasonable future opportunity.  Now we come to the third\\nroad to larning, which is quite a different sort of road; because, you\\nsee, the two first give us little trouble, and we trot along almost\\nwhether we will or not: the third and grand road is the head itself,\\nwhich requires the eye and the ear to help it; and two other assistants,\\nwhich we call memory and application; so you see we have the visual,\\nthen the aural, and then the mental roads--three hard words which you\\ndon\\'t understand, and which I shan\\'t take the trouble to explain to such\\nan animal as you are; for I never throw away pearls to swine, as the\\nsaying is.  Now, then, Mr Keene, we must come to another part of our\\nhistory.  As there are three roads to larning, so there are three manes\\nor implements by which boys are stimulated to larn: the first is the\\nruler, which you saw me shy at the thick skull of Johnny Target, and you\\nsee\\'d what a rap it gave him; well, then, the second is the ferrule--a\\nthing you never heard of, perhaps; but I\\'ll show it you; here it is,\"\\ncontinued Mr O\\'Gallagher, producing a sort of flat wooden ladle with a\\nhole in the centre of it.  \"The ruler is for the head, as you have seen;\\nthe ferrule is for the hand.  You have seen me use the ruler; now I\\'ll\\nshow you what I do with the ferrule.\"\\n\\n\"You Tommy Goskin, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nTommy Goskin put down his book, and came up to his master with a good\\ndeal of doubt in his countenance.\\n\\n\"Tommy Goskin, you didn\\'t say your lesson well to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I did, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\" replied Tommy, \"you said I did yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, sir, you didn\\'t say it well yesterday,\" continued Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"Yes I did, sir,\" replied the boy, whimpering.\\n\\n\"And is it you who dares to contradict me?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"at\\nall events, you won\\'t say it well to-morrow, so hold out your right\\nhand.\"\\n\\nPoor Tommy held it out, and roared lustily at the first blow, wringing\\nhis fingers with the smart.\\n\\n\"Now your left hand, sir; fair play is a jewel; always carry the dish\\neven.\"\\n\\nTommy received a blow on his left hand, which was followed up with\\nsimilar demonstrations of suffering.\\n\\n\"There sir you may go now,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"and mind you don\\'t do\\nit again; or else there\\'ll be a blow-up.  And now Master Keene, we come\\nto the third and last, which is the birch for the tail--here it is--have\\nyou ever had a taste?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, you have that pleasure to come, and come it will, I don\\'t\\ndoubt, if you and I are a few days longer acquainted.  Let me see--\"\\n\\nHere Mr O\\'Gallagher looked round the school, as if to find a culprit;\\nbut the boys, aware of what was going on, kept their eyes so attentively\\nto their books, that he could not discover one; at last he singled out a\\nfat chubby lad.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock came accordingly; evidently he gave himself up for lost.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, I just have been telling Master Keene that you\\'re the\\nbest Latin scholar in the whole school.  Now, sir, don\\'t make me out to\\nbe a liar--do me credit,--or, by the blood of the O\\'Gallaghers, I\\'ll\\nflog ye till you\\'re as thin as a herring.  What\\'s the Latin for a cocked\\nhat, as the Roman gentlemen wore with their _togeys_?\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock hesitated a few seconds, and then, without venturing a\\nword of remonstrance, let down his trousers.\\n\\n\"See now the guilty tief, he knows what\\'s coming.  Shame upon you,\\nWalter Puddock, to disgrace your preceptor so, and make him tell a lie\\nto young Master Keene.  Where\\'s Phil Mooney?  Come along, sir, and hoist\\nWalter Puddock: it\\'s no larning that I can drive into you, Phil, but\\nit\\'s sartain sure that by your manes I drive a little into the other\\nboys.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock, as soon as he was on the back of Phil Mooney, received a\\ndozen cuts with the rod, well laid on.  He bore it without flinching,\\nalthough the tears rolled down his cheeks.\\n\\n\"There, Walter Puddock, I told you it would end in a blow-up; go to your\\ndictionary, you dirty blackguard, and do more credit to your education\\nand superior instruction from a certain person who shall be nameless.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher laid the rod on one side, and then continued--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, I\\'ve just shown you the three roads to larning, and\\nalso the three implements to persuade little boys to larn; if you don\\'t\\ntravel very fast by the three first, why you will be followed up very\\nsmartly by the three last--a nod\\'s as good as a wink to a blind horse,\\nany day; and one thing more, you little spalpeen, mind that there\\'s more\\nmustard to the sandwiches to-morrow, or else it will end in a blow-up.\\nNow you\\'ve got the whole theory of the art of tuition, Master Keene;\\nplease the pigs, we\\'ll commence with the practice to-morrow.\"\\n\\nMy worthy pedagogue did not address me any more during that day; the\\nschool broke up at five, and I made haste home, thinking over all that\\nhad passed in the school-room.\\n\\nMy granny and mother were both anxious to know what had passed; the\\nfirst hoped that I had been flogged, the second that I had not, but I\\nrefused to communicate.  I assumed a haughty, indifferent air, for I was\\nangry with my mother, and as for my grandmother, I hated her.  Aunt\\nMilly, however, when we were alone, did not question me in vain.  I told\\nher all that had passed; she bade me be of good heart, and that I should\\nnot be ill-treated if she could help it.\\n\\nI replied, that if I were ill-treated, I would have my revenge somehow\\nor another.  I then went down to the barracks, to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him what had occurred.  He advised me to laugh at\\nthe ruler, the ferrule, and the rod.  He pointed out to me the necessity\\nof my going to school and learning to read and write, at the same time\\nwas very indignant at the conduct of Mr O\\'Gallagher, and told me to\\nresist in every way any injustice or tyranny, and that I should be sure\\nof his support and assistance, provided that I did pay attention to my\\nstudies.\\n\\nFortified by the advice and protection of my two great friends, I made\\nup my mind that I would learn as fast as I could, but if treated ill,\\nthat I would die a martyr, rather than yield to oppression; at all\\nevents, I would, if possible, play Mr O\\'Gallagher a trick for every\\nflogging or punishment I received; and with this laudable resolution I\\nwas soon fast asleep, too fast even to dream.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX.\\n\\nWhen my aunt Milly called me in the morning, that I might be up and have\\nmy breakfast in time for school, I felt as if two years had passed over\\nmy head during the last twenty-four hours.  I had never witnessed\\ntyranny until the day before, and my blood was heated with indignation:\\nI felt myself capable of anything and everything.\\n\\nMy anger was about as great towards my mother and grandmother for having\\nsent me to such a place, as it was against Mr O\\'Gallagher.  Instead of\\ngoing up and kissing my mother, I paid no attention to either her or my\\ngrandmother, much to the mortification of the former and surprise of the\\nlatter, who said, in a very cross manner, \"Where\\'s your manners, child?\\nwhy don\\'t you say good morning?\"\\n\\n\"Because I have not been long enough at school to learn manners,\\ngranny.\"\\n\\n\"Come and kiss me before you go, my child,\" said my mother.\\n\\n\"No, mother; you have sent me to school to be beat, and I never will\\nkiss you again.\"\\n\\n\"Naughty, good-for-nothing boy!\" exclaimed my granny; \"what a bad heart\\nyou must have.\"\\n\\n\"No, that he has not,\" cried my aunt Milly.  \"Sister should have\\ninquired what sort of a school it was before she sent him.\"\\n\\n\"I made every inquiry,\" replied my granny; \"he can\\'t play tricks there.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t I?\" cried I, \"but I will; and not only there but here.  I\\'ll be\\neven with you all; yes, I\\'ll be even with you, granny, if I die for it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you audacious wretch, I\\'ve great a mind to--\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you have, but recollect I can bite; you\\'d better be quiet,\\ngranny, or, as the master says, `it will end in a blow-up.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Only hear the little wretch,\" said my granny, lifting up her hands; \"I\\nshall see you hanged yet, you ungrateful child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not ungrateful,\" replied I, throwing my arms round Milly\\'s neck,\\nand kissing her with fervour; \"I can love those who love me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t love me?\" said my mother, reproachfully.\\n\\n\"I did yesterday, but I don\\'t now; but it\\'s time for me to go, aunt; is\\nmy basket ready?  I don\\'t want father to take me to school, I can do\\nwithout him, and when I don\\'t choose to go any more, I won\\'t; recollect\\nthat, mother.\"  So saying, I seized my basket and quitted the room.\\nThere was a long consultation, I found, after my departure: my mother,\\nwhen my aunt had informed her of Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s conduct, wished to\\nremove me instantly; my grandmother insisted upon it that there was not\\na word of truth in what I had said, and threatened that if I did not\\nremain at that very school, she would leave Chatham, and take my aunt\\nwith her.  As my mother could not part with aunt Milly, the consequence\\nwas, that my grandmother gained the day.\\n\\nI arrived in good time, and took my seat near my master.  I preferred\\ndoing this, as I had had a long conversation with Captain Bridgeman who\\ntold me that although Mr O\\'Gallagher had put the ruler down as\\npunishment Number 1, the ferrule Number 2, and the birch as Number 3,\\nand of course they were considered to be worse as the number rose, that\\nhe considered it to be the very contrary, as he had had them all well\\napplied when he was at school; he ordered me, therefore, never to hold\\nout my hand to the ferrule, by which refusal I should, of course, be\\nflogged; but he assured me that the birch, especially when it is given\\noften, was a mere nothing.  Now I considered that the surest way to\\navoid the ruler was to sit close to my master, who could then have no\\npretence for sending it at my head; the fact was I had determined to\\nsave the more noble portions of my body, and leave Mr O\\'Gallagher to do\\nwhat he pleased with the other: to do him justice, he lost no time.\\n\\n\"Come here, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"where\\'s your manners? why don\\'t you\\nsay good morning to your preceptor?  Can you read at all?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'ye know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I think I do, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I suppose about two out of six-and-twenty.  It\\'s\\nparticular attention that\\'s been paid to your education, I perceive;\\nyou\\'ve nothing to unlearn anyhow, that\\'s something.  Now, sir, do you\\nthink that a classical scholar and a gentleman born, like me, is to\\ndemane myself by hearing you puzzle at the alphabet?  You\\'re quite\\nmistaken, Mr Keene, you must gain your first elements second-hand; so\\nwhere\\'s Thimothy Ruddel?  You, Timothy Ruddel, you\\'ll just teach this\\nyoung Master Keene his whole alphabet, and take care, at the same time,\\nthat you know your own lessons, or it will end in a blow-up; and you,\\nMaster Keene, if you have not larnt your whole alphabet perfect by\\ndinner time, why you\\'ll have a small taste of Number 2, just as a hint\\nto what\\'s coming next.  Go along, you little ignorant blackguard; and\\nyou, Timothy Ruddel, look out for a taste of Number 3, if you don\\'t larn\\nhim and yourself all at once, and at the same time.\"\\n\\nI was very well pleased with this arrangement; I had resolved to learn,\\nand I was doubly stimulated to learn now, to save poor Timothy Ruddel\\nfrom an unjust punishment.\\n\\nIn the three hours I was quite perfect, and Timothy Ruddel, who was\\ncalled up before me, was also able to say his lesson without a blunder\\nvery much to the disappointment of Mr O\\'Gallagher, who observed, \"So\\nyou\\'ve slipped through my fingers, have you, this time, Master Timothy?\\nNever mind, I\\'ll have you yet; and, moreover, there\\'s Master Keene to go\\nthrough the fiery furnace.\"  Just before dinner time I was called up;\\nwith my memory of many of the letters, and the assistance I had received\\nfrom Timothy Ruddel, I felt very confident.\\n\\n\"What letter\\'s that, sir?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"A B C D E.\"\\n\\n\"You little blackguard, I\\'ll dodge you; you think to escape, you?\"\\n\\n\"V, X, P, O.\"\\n\\nMuch to Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s surprise I said them all without one mistake.\\nInstead of commendation I received abuse.  \"By all the powers,\"\\nexclaimed my pedagogue, \"but everything seems to go wrong to-day; my\\nhand has been completely idle; this will never do; didn\\'t you tell me,\\nMr Keene, that you didn\\'t know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"I said I knew some of them, sir.\"\\n\\n\"If my memory is correct, Mr Keene, you told me that you knew two out\\nof twenty-six.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, you said that.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just as much as to tell me, your preceptor, a classical scholar,\\nand a Milesian gentleman to boot, that I lie, for which I intend to have\\nsatisfaction, Mr Keene, I assure you.  You\\'re guilty in two counts, as\\nthey say at the Old Bailey, where you\\'ll be called up to some of these\\ndays, as sure as you stand there; one count is in telling me a lie, in\\nsaying you did not know your alphabet, when it\\'s quite clear that you\\ndid; and, secondly, in giving me the lie, by stating that I said what\\nyou said.  You thought to escape me, but you\\'re mistaken, Mr Keene; so\\nnow, if you please, we will just have a taste of Number 2.  Hould out\\nyour hand, Mr Keene: d\\'ye hear me sir? hould out your hand.\"\\n\\nBut this I positively refused to do.  \"You won\\'t, won\\'t you?  Well,\\nthen, we must increase the punishment for our contempt of court, and at\\nonce commence with Number 3, which we intended to reserve till\\nto-morrow.  Come along, Phil Mooney, there\\'s fresh mate for you to\\ncarry, and come out Number 3, here\\'s fresh ground for you to travel\\nover.\"\\n\\nPhil Mooney and the birch soon made their appearance: I was hoisted by\\nthe one and scourged by the other.\\n\\nThe first taste of the birch is anything but agreeable; I could only\\ncompare it to the dropping of molten lead.  I tried all I could to\\nprevent crying out, but it was impossible, and at last I roared like a\\nmad bull; and I was as mad as a bull, and as dangerous.  Could I have\\npicked up any weapon at the moment that I was dropped from the shoulders\\nof Phil Mooney, it would have gone hard with Mr O\\'Gallagher.  My rage\\nwas greater than my agony.  I stood when I had been landed, my chest\\nheaving, my teeth set fast, and my apparel still in disorder.  The\\nschool was dismissed, and I was left alone with the savage pedagogue,\\nwho immediately took up my basket, and began to rummage the contents.\\n\\n\"Make yourself decent, Mr Keene, and don\\'t be shocking my modesty, and\\ntaking away my appetite.  Did you mention the mustard, as I desired you?\\nUpon my faith, but you\\'re a nice boy and do justice to the\\nrepresentations of your grandmother, and when you see her you may tell\\nher that I did not forget the promise she exacted from me.  You forgot\\nall about the mustard, you little blackguard.  If Phil Mooney was here I\\nwould give you another taste to freshen your memory for to-morrow;\\nhowever, to-morrow will do as well, if the mistake\\'s not corrected.\\nHere, take your victuals, and good appetite to you, you little monster\\nof iniquity.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher tossed me some bread but this time reserved the cheese\\nfor his own eating.  I had adjusted my dress, and I therefore left the\\nschool-room.  I could not sit down without pain, so I leant against a\\npost: the bread remained in my hand untouched; had it been the greatest\\ndelicacy in the world I could not have tasted a morsel; I was giddy from\\nexcess of feeling, my thoughts were rapidly chasing each other when I\\nheard a voice close to me; I looked round, it was Walter Puddock, who\\nhad been flogged the day before.\\n\\n\"Never mind, Keene,\" said he, kindly; \"it hurts at first, but the more\\nyou get it the less you care for it; I don\\'t mind it a bit now; I cries,\\nbecause he goes on flogging till you do, and it\\'s no use having more\\nthan you can help.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t deserve it,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not necessary; you\\'ll get it, as we all do, whether you deserve\\nit or not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try to deserve it in future,\" replied I, clenching my fist;\\n\"I\\'ll be even with him.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what can you do?\"\\n\\n\"Wait a little, and you\\'ll see,\" said I, walking away, for an idea had\\ncome into my head which I wished to follow up.\\n\\nSoon afterwards the bell rang, and we returned to the schoolroom.  I was\\nput under the tuition of another boy, and took care to learn my lesson.\\nWhether it was that he was tired with the exercise, for he flogged and\\nferruled a dozen during that afternoon, or that he thought that my\\nmorning dose had been sufficient, I received no more punishment on that\\nday.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\\n\\nAs soon as school was dismissed, I went straight to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him how I had been treated.  As soon as he heard it,\\nhe exclaimed, \"This is really too bad; I will go with you, and I will\\nconsult with your aunt Amelia.\"\\n\\nIt so happened that aunt Milly was alone in the shop when we arrived,\\nand after a detail of what had passed, she told Captain Bridgeman that\\nmy grandmother had put me to that school out of feelings of ill-will for\\nthe tricks I had played, and had threatened that if I were removed she\\nwould leave Chatham and take her away with her.  My mother required\\nassistance in the shop, and was afraid to affront my grandmother, who\\nwas a very dictatorial, positive old woman, and would certainly keep her\\nresolution; but that rather than I should be treated in such a barbarous\\nmanner she would insist upon my mother taking me away, or would herself\\nleave the place.\\n\\n\"It would never do for you to leave us, Miss Amelia,\" replied Captain\\nBridgeman, \"there are but few attractions in this place, and we cannot\\nspare you; the whole corps would go into deep mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to leave the school,\" interrupted I; \"I would not leave it\\ntill I am revenged, for all the world.  Now, I\\'ll tell you what I want\\nto do--and do it I will, if he cuts me to pieces.  He eats my\\nsandwiches, and tells me if there\\'s not more mustard to-morrow, he\\'ll\\nflog me.  He shall have plenty of mustard, but he shall have something\\nelse.  What can I put into the sandwiches, so as to half kill him?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, my little Percival,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"I\\'ll just\\nask the doctor how much calomel a man may take without a coroner\\'s\\ninquest being required.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that will do nicely,\" said my aunt; \"I\\'ll take care he shall have\\nmustard enough not to perceive it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll go to the barracks and be back directly,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman.\\n\\n\"And I\\'m ready for the flogging as soon as the sandwiches are down his\\nthroat,\" replied I, laughing, \"I don\\'t care a fig for it.\"\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman soon returned with forty grains of calomel, which he\\ndelivered into aunt Milly\\'s hands.  \"That is as much as we dare give the\\nstrongest man without running great danger; we\\'ll try the effect of that\\nupon him, and if he don\\'t improve, I think I shall go up to the school\\nmyself and threaten him.\"\\n\\n\"As for that,\" replied aunt Milly, \"I\\'m sure that sister, if she hears\\nwhat\\'s going on, as she cannot take Percival away, will order her\\nhusband, Ben, to go up and thrash him.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, Miss Amelia, we\\'ll try that if we find it necessary; at\\nall events, we\\'ll see who can persecute most.\"\\n\\n\"Granny has told him to treat me ill,\" said I, \"that\\'s very clear, from\\nwhat he said; never mind, I\\'ll make her sorry for it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Percival! you must not do anything to granny,\" said aunt Milly,\\nlooking very archly; \"I must not hear anything of the kind.\"\\n\\nThe next morning I set off with a full conviction that I should be\\nflogged before night, and notwithstanding that, as full of joy as if I\\nwas going to the fair.\\n\\nThe morning passed as usual; I said my lesson, but not very well; I was\\nthinking so much of my anticipated revenge, that I could not pay\\nattention to my teacher, who was, as usual, one of the boys.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"we\\'ll let the account stand over\\ntill the evening, and then I\\'ll give you a receipt in full; I may have\\none or two lines to add to it before the sun goes down; you\\'ll not\\nescape me this time, anyhow.\"\\n\\nThe boys went out at the dinner hour, leaving me, as before, to wait for\\nmy basket, after the tyrant had helped himself.  I stood by him in\\nsilence while he was rummaging its contents.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene, I\\'ll see if you\\'ve remembered my particular injunction\\nrelative to the mustard.\"\\n\\n\"I told my aunt to put more mustard, sir,\" replied I, humbly, \"it she\\nthat cuts the sandwiches.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, if your aunt has not complied with your request, see if I\\ndon\\'t flay you alive, you little imp of abomination.\"\\n\\nThe sandwiches were pulled out of the paper and tasted.  \"Down on your\\nknees, Mr Keene, and thank all the blessed saints that your aunt has\\nsaved you from at least one-half of what I intended to administer to you\\nthis blessed afternoon, for she has doubled the mustard, you tief,\" said\\nMr O\\'Gallagher, speaking with his mouth as full as it could hold.  Down\\nwent sandwich after sandwich, until they had all disappeared.  Oh! what\\njoy was mine!  I could have tossed up my cap and leapt in the air.\\nHaving received the bread and cheese, for he permitted me to have the\\nlatter on this occasion I went out and enjoyed my meal, delighted with\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s having fallen into the trap I had laid for him.\\n\\nThe bell summoned us in, and all went on as usual for the first two\\nhours, when I thought Mr O\\'Gallagher changed countenance and looked\\nvery pale.  He continued, however, to hear the lessons, until at last I\\nperceived him pass his hand up and down and across his stomach, as if he\\nhad had a twinge; a few minutes afterwards, he compressed his thick\\nlips, and then put his hands to his abdomen.\\n\\n\"Ah! he begins to feel it now,\" thought I; and sure enough he did; for\\nthe pain increased so rapidly that he lost all patience, and vented his\\nfeelings by beating with his ruler, on the heads of the whole class of\\nboys standing up before him, till one or two dropped down, stunned with\\nthe blows.  At last he dropped the ruler, and, pressing both hands to\\nhis stomach, he rolled himself backwards and forwards, and then twisted\\nand distorted his legs till he could bear the pain no longer; and he\\ngave vent to a tremendous Irish howl--grinning and grinding his teeth\\nfor a few seconds, and then howling again, writhing and twisting in\\nevident agony--while the perspiration ran off his forehead.\\n\\n\"Och! murder!  I\\'m poisoned sure.  Lord save my sinful soul!  Oh--oh--\\noh! eh--eh--eh! mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy!  Oh holy St. Patrick!\\nI\\'m kilt entirely:\"--and so subdued was he at last by the pain, that he\\nburst out into a flood of tears, crying and roaring like a child.\\n\\nAgain the paroxysms came on--\"Murder, murder, murder!\" shrieked the\\nwretch at the highest pitch of his voice, so that he was heard at some\\ndistance, and some of the neighbours came in to inquire what was the\\nmatter.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher was now in a fainting state, and leaning against the\\ntable, he could merely say in a low voice, \"A doctor--quick--a doctor.\"\\n\\nThe neighbours perceiving how ill he was, led him out of the\\nschool-rooms into his own apartment, one going for a doctor, and the\\nothers telling the boys they might all go home, a notice of which they\\ngladly availed themselves.\\n\\nI need hardly say, that I made all the haste I could to communicate the\\nsuccessful result of my trick to Milly and Captain Bridgeman.  The\\nmedical man who was summoned, gave Mr O\\'Gallagher some very active\\nmedicine, which assisted to rid him of the calomel; of his having taken\\nwhich, of course, the medical man was ignorant.  The violence of the\\ndose was, however, so great, and left him in such a state, that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher could not leave his room for three days, nor resume his seat\\nin the school until a week had elapsed, during which I remained at home\\nplotting still further mischief.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher resumed his occupations, and I was again sent off to\\nschool.  When I entered the school-room I found him looking very pale\\nand cadaverous; as soon as he saw me his lips were drawn apart, and he\\nshowed his large white teeth, reminding me of the grinning of a hyena;\\nhe did not, however, say anything to me.  My studies were resumed; I\\nsaid my lesson perfectly, but was fully prepared for punishment.  I was,\\nhowever, agreeably disappointed; he did not punish either me or any of\\nthe other boys.\\n\\nI afterwards found out the reason was, that, although necessity\\ncompelled him to re-open his school as soon as he could, he was too weak\\nto undergo the fatigue of following up his favourite diversion.\\n\\nWhen the dinner-hour arrived, and the boys were dismissed, I waited\\npatiently to see what he would do with my basket, which stood beside\\nhim.  \"Take your basket, and eat your dinner, Master Keene,\" said he,\\nwalking out of the school-room into his own apartments.  I could not\\nhelp saying, \"Won\\'t you have the sandwiches, sir?\"\\n\\nHe turned round and gave me a look so penetrating and so diabolical,\\nthat I felt sure that he knew to whom he had been indebted for his late\\nsevere illness.\\n\\nFrom this day forward Mr O\\'G never interfered with the contents of my\\nbasket and I had my dinner all to myself.  The shock which had been\\ngiven to his constitution was so great, that for three or four months he\\nmay be said to have crawled to his school room, and I really began to\\nthink that the affair would turn out more serious than was intended; but\\ngradually he regained his strength, and as he recovered his vigour, so\\ndid he resume his severity.\\n\\nBut I was a great gainer during the three or four months of quiet which\\nreigned during Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s convalescence.  Since I have been grown\\nup, I have often thought, and am indeed confirmed in my opinion, that we\\nlose rather than gain by being educated at too early an age.  Commence\\nwith one child at three years, and with another at seven years old, and\\nin ten years, the one whose brain was left fallow even till seven years\\nold, will be quite as far, if not further advanced, than the child whose\\nintellect was prematurely forced at the earlier age; this is a fact\\nwhich I have since seen proved in many instances, and it certainly was\\ncorroborated in mine.\\n\\nIn six months I could read and write very fairly, and had commenced\\narithmetic; true, I was stimulated on by the advice of Captain\\nBridgeman, the love I bore my aunt Milly, and the hatred which I had for\\nmy master, which made me resolve that I would not deserve punishment on\\nthat score.\\n\\nIt was in May that I administered the dose to Mr O\\'Gallagher; in\\nSeptember he was quite well again, and the ruler, the ferrule, and the\\nrod, were triumphantly at work.  It is useless to say how often I was\\npunished, for it was every day; always once, sometimes twice; I became\\ncompletely callous to it, nay, laughed at it, but my mind was ever at\\nwork upon some mischief, in the way of retaliation.\\n\\nI put little pancakes of cobblers\\' wax on Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, and\\nhe had the pleasure of finding himself stuck fast by the breeches when\\nhe rose up to punish.  I anointed the handle of the ferrule and rod with\\nbird-lime; put dead cats under the claret cases, which composed his seat\\nof authority, so that the smell would drive him distracted before he\\nfound it out.  I drew up with a squirt, all the ink which was in the\\ninkstands fixed in the writing-desks, so as not to be taken out of the\\nsockets, and made good the deficiency with water, which put him to no\\nlittle expense.\\n\\nI once made him almost frantic, by rubbing his handkerchief which always\\nlaid by his side, and with which he was accustomed to wipe his face\\nevery five minutes (for he was profuse in his perspiration), with what\\nis called cow-itch: not being aware of what was the cause, he wiped his\\nface more and more, until he was as red as a peony, and the itching\\nbecame intolerable.\\n\\nOn such occasions he never inquired who was the party, but called me and\\nPhil Mooney.  I, on the other hand, never said a word in way of\\nexpostulation.  I took my flogging, which was as severe as he could give\\nit, as a matter of course, quite satisfied with the exchange.\\n\\nAs Walter Puddock had told me, and, as I have no doubt, the Eton boys\\nwill confirm, after a certain quantity of flagellations, the skin\\nbecomes so hard as to make the punishment almost a matter of\\nindifference and so I found it.  So passed the time until the month of\\nNovember, when I was fully enabled to pay off my worthy pedagogue for\\nall that I was indebted to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\\n\\nThe boys had been saving up all their money to purchase fireworks for\\nthe celebrated 5th of November--a day on which it was said that certain\\npersons, finding it impossible to reform the Lords and Commons, had\\ndetermined to get rid of them at once: why they have not been in similar\\ndanger every year since the first attempt was made, I know not; certain\\nit is, that it is the only reform measure that can ever be effectual.\\nGuy Fawkes and his confederates, whether Popish or Protestant, from the\\ndisregard of human life, certainly proved themselves the founders of a\\nparty, still existing, whose motto is, \"Measures and not Men.\"\\n\\nBut to proceed: Mr O\\'Gallagher had never before attempted to interfere\\nwith the vested rights of urchins on that day; being, however, in a most\\nparticular irascible humour, instead of a whole, he made it known that\\nthere would only be a half, holiday, and we were consequently all called\\nin for morning lessons instead of carrying about, as we had intended,\\nthe effigy of the only true reformer that ever existed in this country.\\n\\nThis made us all very sulky and discontented in the first place, and our\\nanxiety to get out of school was so great, that the lessons were not\\nvery perfect in the second.  The ferrule and rod were called out and\\nliberally administered; but what was our horror and dismay when Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, about an hour before dinner, announced to us that all the\\nsquibs and crackers, with which our pockets were crammed, were to be\\ngiven up immediately; and that, as we had not said our lessons well,\\nthere would be no half-holiday, the whole school were in mute despair.\\n\\nOne by one were the boys summoned up to the throne of Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\nand their pockets searched by Phil Mooney, who emptied them of their\\npyrotechnical contents, all of which were deposited on the dais of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, which, I have before observed, was composed of two\\nempty claret cases turned upside down, surmounted by another, on which\\nMr O\\'Gallagher sat, all three covered with old green baize.\\n\\nBy the time that the whole school had been rifled, the heap of fireworks\\nwas very considerable, and Mr O\\'Gallagher, to prevent any of them being\\nrecovered by the boys, lifted up the claret case on which he sat, and\\nwhich was on the top of the other two, and desired Phil Mooney to put\\nthem all underneath it.  This was done; Mr O\\'Gallagher resumed his\\nseat, and the lessons continued till the dinner hour arrived, but, alas!\\nnot the half-holiday or the fireworks.\\n\\nThe boys went out; some mournful, some angry, some sulky, some\\nfrightened; a few, a very few, declaiming against such injustice.\\n\\nI was in a rage; my blood boiled; at last my invention came to my aid,\\nand, without considering the consequences, I determined how to act.\\n\\nAs it was an hour and a half before school would commence, I hastened\\nhome, and, having spent all my money, begged aunt Milly to give me some;\\nshe gave me a shilling, and with that I bought as much gunpowder as I\\ncould procure, more than a quarter of a pound.\\n\\nI then returned to the school, looked into the school-room, and found it\\nempty; I quickly raised up the claret case, under which the fireworks\\nhad been placed, put the powder under it, leaving only sufficient for a\\nvery small train, which would not be perceived in the green baize\\ncovering; having so done, I left the school-room immediately, and\\nrejoined my companions.  I had a piece of touch-wood, as all the boys\\nhad, to let off their fireworks with, and this I lighted and left in a\\ncorner until the bell should summons us into school.\\n\\nOh! how my heart beat when I heard the sound, so full was I of anxiety\\nlest my project should fail.\\n\\nOnce more we were all assembled.  Mr O\\'Gallagher surveying, with the\\nsmile of a demon, the unhappy and disappointed faces of the boys, was\\nagain perched upon his throne, the rod on one side, the ferrule on the\\nother, and the ruler, that dreaded truncheon of command, clenched in his\\nbroad fist.\\n\\nI had the touchwood lighted and concealed in my hand; gradually I moved\\ndownwards, until at last, unperceived by Mr O\\'Gallagher, I was behind\\nhim, and close to my train of gunpowder.  I gave one look to ascertain\\nif he had observed me; his eye was roving over the school for some\\ndelinquent to throw his ruler at; fearful that he might turn round to\\nme, I no longer hesitated, and the touchwood was applied to the train.\\n\\nIgnorant as I was of the force of gunpowder, it was with astonishment,\\nmingled with horror, that I beheld, in a second, the claret case rise up\\nas if it had wings, and Mr O\\'Gallagher thrown up to the ceiling\\nenveloped in a cloud of smoke, the crackers and squibs fizzing and\\nbanging, while the boys in the school uttered a yell of consternation\\nand fear as they rushed from from the explosion, and afterwards,\\ntumbling over one another, made their escape from the school-room.\\n\\nThe windows had all been blown out with a terrible crash, and the whole\\nschool-room was now covered by the smoke.  There I stood in silent\\ndismay at the mischief which I had done.  The squibs and crackers had\\nnot, however, all finished popping, before I heard the howling of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, who had fallen down upon the centre school-room table.\\n\\nI was still in the school-room, half-suffocated, yet not moving away\\nfrom where I stood, when the neighbours, who had been alarmed by the\\nexplosion and the cries of the boys, rushed in, and perceiving only me\\nand Mr O\\'Gallagher, who still howled, they caught hold of us both, and\\nbore us out in their arms.  It was high time, for the school-room was\\nnow on fire, and in a few minutes more the flames burst out of the\\nwindows, while volumes of smoke forced through the door and soon\\nafterwards the roof.\\n\\nThe engines were sent for, but before they could arrive, or water be\\nprocured, the whole tenement was so enveloped in flames that it could\\nnot be saved.  In an hour, the _locale_ of our misery was reduced to\\nashes.  They had put me on my legs as soon as we got clear of the\\nschool-room, to ascertain whether I was hurt, and finding that I was\\nnot, they left me.\\n\\nI never shall forget what my sensations were, when I beheld the flames\\nand volumes of smoke bursting out; the hurry, and bustle, and confusion\\noutside; the working of the engines, the troops marched up from the\\nbarracks, the crowd of people assembled, and the ceaseless mingling of\\ntongues from every quarter; and all this is my doing, thought I--mine--\\nall mine.\\n\\nI felt delighted that I had no partner or confederate; I could, at all\\nevents, keep my own secret.  I did, however, feel some anxiety as to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, for, much as I detested him, I certainly had no intention\\nto kill him; so after a time, I made inquiries, and found that he was\\nalive: and in no danger, although very much bruised and somewhat burnt.\\n\\nNo one could explain how the catastrophe occurred, further than that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had collected all the squibs and crackers from the boys, and\\nthat they had exploded somehow or another--most people said that it\\nserved him right.  My grandmother shook her head and said, \"Yes, yes,\\ngunpowder will go off, but--\" and she looked at me--\"it requires a match\\nto be put to it.\"  I looked up very innocently, but made no reply.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s favourite expression, to wit, \"that it would end in a\\nblow-up,\" proved, as far as his school was concerned, literally true.\\nHe had not the means of procuring another suitable tenement in Chatham,\\nand as soon as he had recovered from the injuries he had received, he\\nquitted the town.\\n\\nIt was not until he had left, that I ventured to make known to Captain\\nBridgeman, and my aunt Milly, the trifling share I had in the\\ntransaction; and they, perceiving the prudence of keeping my secret,\\ndesired me on no account to let it be known to any one else.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE.\\n\\nAs soon as it was ascertained that Mr O\\'Gallagher was gone, my\\ngrandmother insisted upon my being sent to another school, and on this\\noccasion my mother made the inquiries herself, and I was despatched to\\none much nearer home, and being treated well, not only played fewer\\ntricks, but advanced rapidly in my education; so rapidly indeed, that my\\ngrandmother began to think that I was not so bad a boy as I used to be.\\n\\nAs she treated me more kindly, I felt less inclined to teaze her\\nalthough the spirit of mischief was as undiminished as ever, and was\\nshown in various ways.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that out of the many admirers of my aunt\\nMilly, there were only two who appeared to be at all constant in their\\nattention.  One was Lieutenant Flat, who was positively smitten, and\\nwould have laid his pay and person at her feet, had he received anything\\nlike encouragement; but my aunt disliked him in the first place, and,\\nmoreover, had a very strong feeling towards Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nMr Flat was certainly a very fine-looking soldier, being tall, erect,\\nand well-made, but he was at the same time not over-brilliant; he was,\\nas an officer, the very sort of person my father Ben was as a private.\\n\\nBut the other party, Captain Bridgeman, did not come forward; he\\nappeared to be in doubt, and not at all able to make up his mind.\\n\\nThe fact was, that my mother being married to a private, made any match\\nwith the sister objectionable to the whole corps, as it would be\\nderogatory that one sister should be the wife of a private, and the\\nother of an officer.  Ben would have been able to say, \"My\\nbrother-in-law, the captain of my division,\" which would never have\\ndone; and this Captain Bridgeman felt, and therefore resisted, as well\\nas he could, the inroads which my aunt\\'s beauty and mirth had made into\\nhis heart.  My aunt was exactly a person to suit Captain Bridgeman as a\\nhelpmate, had it not been for this unfortunate alliance of my mother\\'s.\\n\\nLieutenant Flat was too stupid and indifferent to the opinion of the\\nother officers, to care anything about what they thought; he would have\\nmarried Milly long before, but my aunt, who had made up her mind to\\nmarry an officer, did not yet despair of obtaining the captain; and\\nalthough she would not positively dismiss Lieutenant Flat, she merely\\nkept him as a sort of reserve, to fall back upon when every other chance\\nwas gone.\\n\\nI should like, if I possibly could, to give the reader some idea of my\\nmother\\'s circulating-library and sort of universal commodity shop: it\\nwas a low-windowed building, one story high, but running a long way\\nback, where it was joined to a small parlour, in which we generally sat\\nduring the day, as it was convenient in case of company or customers,\\nthe little parlour having a glass door, which permitted us to look into\\nthe shop.\\n\\nIn the front windows, on one side, were all the varieties of tapers,\\nsealing-wax, inkstands, and every kind of stationery, backed by\\nchildren\\'s books, leather writing-cases, prints, caricatures, and\\nTonbridge ware.  In the other windows were ribbons, caps, gloves,\\nscarfs, needles, and other little articles in demand by ladies, and\\nwhich they required independent of their milliners.\\n\\nAt the entrance were sticks and canes; on the counter a case of gold and\\nmore moderate-priced trinkets.  On the shelves of the millinery side\\nwere boxes of gloves, ribbons, buttons, etcetera.  On the opposite side,\\nperfumes, cigars, toothbrushes, combs, scented soaps, and other\\nrequisites for the toilet.\\n\\nAbout ten feet on each side of the shop was occupied with the above\\narticles; the remainder of the shelves were reserved for the\\ncirculating-library.\\n\\nAt the back of the shop were some seats round a small table, on which\\nwas laid the newspaper of the day, and on each side of the parlour-door\\nwere hoops, bats, balls, traps, skittles, and a variety of toys for\\nchildren.\\n\\nMy mother usually attended to the millinery, and my aunt Milly to what\\nmight be termed the gentlemen\\'s side of the shop; the remainder of the\\ngoods and circulating-library were in the hands of both.\\n\\nThere were few hours of the day in which the chairs at the counter and\\nround the table were not taken possession of by some one or another,\\neither reading the paper or a book, or talking, to pass away the time.\\nIn fact, it was a sort of rendezvous, where all who met knew each other,\\nand where the idle of our own sex used to repair to get rid of their\\ntime.  Captain Bridgeman and Mr Flat were certainly the two most\\nconstantly to be found there, although few of the marine officers were a\\nday without paying us a visit.\\n\\nSuch was the _locale_; to describe the company will be more difficult,\\nbut I will attempt it.\\n\\nMy mother, remarkably nicely dressed, is busy opening a parcel of new\\nbooks just arrived.  My aunt Milly behind the counter, on the\\ngentlemen\\'s side, pretending to be working upon a piece of muslin about\\nfive inches square.  Mr Flat sitting near the table, fallen back in his\\nchair, apparently watching the flies on the ceiling.  Captain Bridgeman,\\na very good-looking man, very slight, but extremely active, is sitting\\nat the counter opposite to where my aunt is standing, a small black\\ncane, with a silver head to it, in his hand, and his gloves peculiarly\\nclean and well-fitting.  He has an eye as sharp as an eagle\\'s, a slight\\nhook to his nose, thin lips, and very white teeth; his countenance is as\\nfull of energy and fire as that of lieutenant Flat is heavy and\\nunmeaning.\\n\\n\"Miss Amelia, if I may take the liberty,\" said Captain Bridgeman,\\npointing with his cane to the bit of muslin she is employed upon; \"what\\nare you making? it\\'s too small for any part of a lady\\'s dress.\"\\n\\n\"It is quite large enough for a cuff, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"A cuff; then you are making a cuff, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed she is not, Captain Bridgeman,\" replies my mother; \"it is only\\nto keep herself out of mischief.  She spoils a bit like that every week.\\nAnd that\\'s why it is so small, Captain Bridgeman; it would be a pity to\\nspoil a larger piece.\"\\n\\n\"I really was not aware that such a mere trifle would keep you out of\\nmischief,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"You know,\" replied Aunt Milly, \"that idleness is the root of all evil,\\nCaptain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Flat, do you hear that?\" says Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"What?\" replies Flat.\\n\\n\"That idleness is the root of all evil; what an evil-disposed person you\\nmust be.\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking,\" replied Flat.\\n\\n\"I suspect it\\'s only lately you\\'ve taken to that.  Who or what were you\\nthinking about?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I believe I was thinking how long it would be before dinner was\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very rude, Mr Flat; you might have said that you were thinking\\nabout me,\" replied my aunt.\\n\\n\"Well, so I was at first, and then I began to think of dinner-time.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be offended, Miss Amelia; Flat pays you a great compliment in\\ndividing his attentions; but I really wish to know why ladies will spoil\\nmuslin in such a predetermined manner.  Will you explain that, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Captain Bridgeman: a piece of work is very valuable to a woman,\\nespecially when she finds herself in company with gentlemen like you.\\nIt saves her from looking down, or looking at you, when you are talking\\nnonsense; it prevents your reading in her eyes what is passing in her\\nmind, or discovering what effect your words may have upon her; it saves\\nmuch awkwardness, and very often a blush; sometimes a woman hardly knows\\nwhich way to look; sometimes she may look any way but the right.  Now a\\nbit of muslin with a needle is a remedy for all that, for she can look\\ndown at her work, and not look up till she thinks it advisable.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for your explanation, madam; I shall always take it as a\\ngreat compliment if I see a lady very busy at work when I\\'m conversing,\\nwith her.\"\\n\\n\"But you may flatter yourself, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied my mother;\\n\"the attention to her work may arise from perfect indifference, or from\\npositive annoyance.  It saves the trouble of making an effort to be\\npolite.\"\\n\\n\"And pray, may I inquire, Miss Amelia, what feeling may cause your\\nparticular attention to your work at this present moment?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps in either case to preserve my self-possession,\" replied Amelia;\\n\"or perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, I may prefer looking at a piece of\\nmuslin to looking at a marine officer.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not very flattering,\" replied the captain; \"if you spoil the\\nmuslin, you\\'re determined not to spoil me.\"\\n\\n\"The muslin is of little value,\" said Amelia, softly, walking to the\\nother side of the shop, and turning over the books.\\n\\n\"Mr Flat,\" said my mother, \"your subscription to the library is out\\nlast month; I presume I can put your name down again?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know; I never read a book,\" replied Mr Flat, yawning.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not at all necessary, Mr Flat,\" said my mother; \"in most\\nbusinesses there are sleeping partners; besides, if you don\\'t read, you\\ncome here to talk, which is a greater enjoyment still, and luxuries must\\nbe paid for.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try another quarter,\" replied Mr Flat, \"and then--\"\\n\\n\"And then what?\" said my aunt Milly, smiling.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" says Flat.  \"Is that clock of yours right, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"It is; but I am fearful that your thoughts run faster than the clock,\\nMr Flat; you are thinking of the dress-bugle for dinner.\"\\n\\n\"No, I was not.\"\\n\\n\"Then you were thinking of yourself?\"\\n\\n\"No, I wasn\\'t, Mrs Keene,\" said Flat, rising, and walking out of the\\nshop.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" said he, turning round as he went out, \"what I was\\nthinking of, Mrs Keene; not of myself,--I was thinking of my bull pup.\"\\n\\nMy mother burst out a laughing as the lieutenant disappeared.  \"I was\\nnot far wrong when I said he was thinking of himself,\" said she, \"for a\\n_calf_ is a sort of _bull pup_.\"\\n\\nAt this sally Captain Bridgeman laughed, and danced about the shop; at\\nlast he said, \"Poor Flat!  Miss Amelia, he\\'s desperately in love with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s more than I am with him,\" said Amelia, calmly.\\n\\nHere two ladies came in.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman made a most polite bow.  \"I trust Mrs Handbell is\\nquite well and Miss Handbell--I hardly need ask the question with the\\ncharming colour you have?\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman, you appear to live in this library; I wonder Mrs\\nKeene don\\'t take you into partnership.\"\\n\\n\"If I were not honoured with the custom of Mrs Handbell and other\\nladies; I fear that my shop would have little attraction for gentlemen,\"\\nreplied my mother, with a courtesy.\\n\\n\"Mrs Keene is quite correct in her surmise, Miss Handbell,\" said\\nCaptain Bridgeman, \"now that I have seen you, I shall not think my\\nmorning thrown away.\"\\n\\n\"If report says true, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied Mrs Handbell, \"you\\nwould be quite as often here, even if no ladies were to be customers of\\nMrs Keene.  Mrs Keene, have you any of that narrow French ribbon\\nleft?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have, madam; it was off this piece, was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but I really don\\'t know exactly how much I require; perhaps you\\nwill measure it and allow me to return what is left?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, madam; will you take it with you, or shall I send it?\"\\n\\n\"I wish for it directly; will you be very long in measuring it, for I\\nought to be home now?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you\\'ll have the kindness to measure what you take off yourself,\\nmadam,\" replied my mother, \"and then you need not wait.\"\\n\\n\"You put confidence in me, I observe, Mrs Keene,\" replied Mrs\\nHandbell; \"well, I will do you justice.\"\\n\\nMy mother smiled most graciously, put the piece of ribbon in paper, and\\nhanded it to Mrs Handbell, who, bowing to Captain Bridgeman, quitted\\nthe shop.\\n\\n\"I wonder whether you would trust me in that way?\" said Captain\\nBridgeman to my mother.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I should; Amelia says you will help yourself to cigars\\nand that she is sure you cheat when you count them.\"\\n\\n\"Does she really say that?  Well, I did think that if there was any one\\nwho would have upheld my character, it would have been Miss Amelia.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, she is getting tired of so doing.\"\\n\\n\"Or tired of me, Mrs Keene, which would be worse still.  Here comes a\\nfair young lady--Miss Evans, if I mistake not; I believe she is a good\\ncustomer to your library?\"\\n\\n\"She reads a great deal, and is therefore only a customer to the\\nlibrary.\"\\n\\n\"Ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning Miss Evans,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"you come for more\\nfood for the mind, I presume?\"  (Miss Evans gave a bob, and turned to my\\nmother.)\\n\\n\"Have you anything new, Mrs Keene?  I have brought back the three\\nvolumes of Godolphin.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, I have some books down to-day.\"\\n\\nWhile Miss Evans was selecting from the new books, enter Mr Jones, Mr\\nSmith, and Mr Claville, of the marine corps, for cigars.  Amelia comes\\nout to attend them--they purchase a few articles, and are talking very\\nloud, when three more ladies enter the shop, all for books.\\n\\nIt being now about three o\\'clock, the customers and loungers come in\\nfast.  Captain Bridgeman saunters away in company with his brother\\nofficers; other parties enter, who are succeeded by fresh claimants for\\nbooks or the other articles to be procured in the repository.\\n\\nThis demand continues till about five o\\'clock, when the library becomes\\nempty; I come home from school, my father slinks in from barracks, and\\nmy mother and sister return to the back parlour, where they find my\\ngrandmother, as usual, very busy with her knitting.\\n\\nSuch is a fair sample of what took place at our shop every succeeding\\nday.  My mother made few bad debts, and rapidly added to her savings.\\nMy aunt Milly still balancing between the certainty of Lieutenant Flat\\nand the chance of Captain Bridgeman, and I dividing my time and talents\\nbetween learning and contriving mischief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN.\\n\\nAbout six months after I had blown up the school of Mr O\\'Gallagher, the\\ncompany to which my father Ben belonged was ordered afloat again, and\\nshortly afterwards sailed for the East Indies, in the Redoubtable, 74.\\nThat my mother was very much pleased at his departure, I do not scruple\\nto assert; but whether she ever analysed her feelings, I cannot pretend\\nto say; I rather think that all she wished was, that the chapter of\\naccidents would prevent Ben\\'s reappearance, as she was ashamed of him as\\na husband, and felt that he was an obstacle to her sister\\'s advancement.\\n\\nSo one fine day Ben wished us all good bye; my mother was very generous\\nto him, as she could well afford to be.  I rather think that Ben himself\\nwas not sorry to go, for, stupid as he was, he must have felt what a\\ncypher he had become, being treated, not only by my mother, but by\\neverybody else, even by me, as a sort of upper servant.\\n\\nIt so happened, that about a month after Ben\\'s departure, Captain Delmar\\nhad, through the interest of his uncle, Lord de Versely, been appointed\\nto a ship which was lying in the Medway, and he came down to Chatham to\\njoin her.  He had no idea that my mother was there, for he had lost\\nsight of her altogether, and had it not been for me, might very probably\\nhave left the town without having made the discovery.\\n\\nAmong other amusements, I had a great partiality for a certain bull pup,\\nmentioned by Lieutenant Flat in the former chapter, and which he had\\nmade me a present of; the pup was now grown up, and I had taught it many\\ntricks; but the one which afforded me most amusement (of course, at\\nother people\\'s expense) was, that I had made out of oakum a sham\\npigtail, about a foot and a half long, very strong and think, with an\\niron hook at the upper end of it.\\n\\nThe sham tail I could easily hook on to the collar of any one\\'s coat\\nfrom behind, without their perceiving it; and Bob had been instructed by\\nme, whenever I told him to fetch it (and not before), to jump up at the\\ntail wherever it might be, and hang on to it with all the tenacity of\\nthe race.\\n\\nAs it may be supposed, this was a great source of mirth in the barracks;\\nit was considered a good joke, and was much applauded by Captain\\nBridgeman; but it was not considered a good joke out of the barracks;\\nand many an old woman had I already frightened almost out of her senses,\\nby affixing the tail to any portion of the back part of her dress.\\n\\nIt so happened, that one afternoon, as I was cruising about with Bob at\\nmy heels, I perceived the newly-arrived Captain Delmar, in all the pomp\\nof pride of full uniform, parading down the street with a little middy\\nat his heels; and I thought to myself, \"Law! how I should like to hang\\nmy tail to his fine coat, if I only dared;\" the impulse had become so\\nstrong, that I actually had pulled up my pinafore and disengaged the\\ntail ready for any opportunity, but I was afraid that the middy would\\nsee me.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had passed close to me, the middy at his heels was\\npassing, and I thought all chance was gone, when, suddenly, Captain\\nDelmar turned short round and addressed the little officer, asking him\\nwhether he had brought the order-book with him?  The middy touched his\\nhat, and said, \"No;\" upon which Captain Delmar began to inflict a most\\nserious lecture upon the lad for forgetting what he had forgotten\\nhimself, and I again passed by.\\n\\nThis was an opportunity I could not resist; while the captain and middy\\nwere so well employed giving and receiving I fixed my oakum tail to the\\ncollar of the Captain\\'s gold-laced coat, and then walked over to the\\nother side of the street with Bob at my heels.\\n\\nThe middy being duly admonished, Captain Delmar turned round again and\\nresumed his way; upon which I called Bob, who was quite as ready for the\\nfun as I was, and pointing to the captain, said, \"Fetch it, Bob.\"  My\\ncompanion cleared the street in three or four bounds, and in a few\\nseconds afterwards made a spring up the back of Captain Delmar, and\\nseizing the tail, hung by it with his teeth, shaking it with all his\\nmight as he hung in the air.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was, to use a sailor\\'s term, completely taken aback;\\nindeed he was nearly capsized by the unexpected assault.  For a short\\ntime he could not discover what it was; at last, by turning his head\\nover his shoulder and putting his hand behind him, he discovered who his\\nassailant was.\\n\\nJust at that time, I called out \"Mad dog! mad dog!\" and Captain Delmar,\\nhearing those alarming words, became dreadfully frightened; his cocked\\nhat dropped from his head, and he took to his heels as fast as he could,\\nrunning down the street, with Bob clinging behind him.\\n\\nThe first open door he perceived was that of my mother\\'s library; he\\nburst in, nearly upsetting Captain Bridgeman, who was seated at the\\ncounter, talking to Aunt Milly, crying out \"Help! help!\"  As he turned\\nround, his sword became entangled between his legs, tripped him up, and\\nhe fell on the floor.  This unhooked the tail, and Bob galloped out of\\nthe shop, bearing his prize to me, who, with the little middy, remained\\nin the street convulsed with laughter.  Bob delivered up the tail, which\\nI again concealed under my pinafore, and then with a demure face\\nventured to walk towards my mother\\'s house, and, going in at the back\\ndoor, put Master Bob in the wash-house out of the way; the little middy\\nwho had picked up the captain\\'s hat, giving me a wink as I passed him,\\nas much as to say, I won\\'t inform against you.\\n\\nIn the meantime Captain Delmar had been assisted to his legs by Captain\\nBridgeman, who well knew who had played the trick, and who, as well as\\nAunt Milly, had great difficulty in controlling his mirth.\\n\\n\"Merciful heaven! what was it?  Was the animal mad?  Has it bitten me?\"\\nexclaimed Captain Delmar, falling back in his chair, in which he had\\nbeen seated by Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"I really do not know,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"but you are not\\nhurt, sir, apparently, nor indeed is your coat torn.\"\\n\\n\"What dog--whose dog can it be?--it must be shot immediately--I shall\\ngive orders--I shall report the case to the admiral.  May I ask for a\\nglass of water?  Oh, Mr Dott! you\\'re there, sir; how came you to allow\\nthat dog to fasten himself on my back in that way?\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" said the middy, presenting his cocked hat to the\\ncaptain, \"I did draw my dirk to kill him, but you ran away so fast that\\nI couldn\\'t catch you.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir, you may go down to the boat and wait for orders,\"\\nreplied the captain.\\n\\nAt this moment my mother, who had been dressing herself, made her first\\nappearance, coming out of the back parlour with a glass of water, which\\naunt Milly had gone in for.  Perceiving a gold-laced captain, she\\nadvanced all smiles and courtesies, until she looked in his face, and\\nthen she gave a scream, and dropped the tumbler on the floor, much to\\nthe surprise of Captain Bridgeman, and also of aunt Milly, who, not\\nhaving been at the Hall, was not acquainted with the person of Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nJust at this moment in came I, looking as demure as if, as the saying\\nis, \"butter would not melt in my mouth,\" and certainly as much\\nastonished as the rest at my mother\\'s embarrassment; but she soon\\nrecovered herself, and asked Captain Delmar if he would condescend to\\nrepose himself a little in the back parlour.  When my mother let the\\ntumbler fall, the captain had looked her full in the face and recognised\\nher, and, in a low voice, said, \"Excessively strange,--so very\\nunexpected!\"  He then rose up from the chair and followed my mother into\\nthe back room.\\n\\n\"Who can it be?\" said Aunt Milly to Captain Bridgeman, in a low tone.\\n\\n\"I suppose it must be the new captain appointed to the Calliope.  I read\\nhis name in the papers,--the Honourable Captain Delmar.\"\\n\\n\"It must be him,\" replied Milly; \"for my sister was brought up by his\\naunt, Mrs Delmar; no wonder she was surprised at meeting him so\\nsuddenly.  Percival, you naughty boy,\" continued Milly, shaking her\\nfinger at me, \"it was all your doing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Aunt Milly! you should have seen him run,\" replied I, laughing at\\nthe thought.\\n\\n\"I\\'d recommend you not to play with post captains,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman, \"or you may get worse than you give.  Mercy on us!\" exclaimed\\nhe, looking at me full in the face.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said aunt Milly.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman leant over the counter, and I heard him whisper, \"Did\\nyou ever see such a likeness as between the lad and Captain Delmar?\"\\n\\nMilly blushed a little, nodded her head, and smiled, as she turned away.\\nCaptain Bridgeman appeared to be afterwards in a brown study; he tapped\\nhis boot with his cane, and did not speak.\\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed, during which Captain Delmar remained\\nwith my mother in the parlour, when she opened the door, and beckoned me\\nto come in.  I did so not without some degree of anxiety, for I was\\nafraid that I had been discovered: but this doubt was soon removed;\\nCaptain Delmar did me the honour to shake hands with me, and then patted\\nmy head saying, he hoped I was a good boy, which, being compelled to be\\nmy own trumpeter, I very modestly declared that I was.  My mother, who\\nwas standing up behind, lifted up her eyes at my barefaced assertion.\\nCaptain Delmar then shook hands with my mother, intimating his intention\\nof paying her another visit very soon, and again patting me on the head,\\nquitted the parlour, and went away through the shop.\\n\\nAs soon as Captain Delmar was gone, my mother turned round, and said,\\n\"You naughty, mischievous boy, to play such pranks.  I\\'ll have that dog\\nkilled, without you promise me never to do so again.\"\\n\\n\"Do what again, mother?\"\\n\\n\"None of your pretended innocence with me.  I\\'ve been told of the\\npigtail that Bob pulls at.  That\\'s all very well at the barracks with\\nthe marines, sir, but do you know _who_ it is that you have been playing\\nthat trick to?\"\\n\\n\"No mother, I don\\'t.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"Who is he, you undutiful child? why, he\\'s--he\\'s the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what of that?\" replied I.  \"He\\'s a naval captain, ain\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but he\\'s the nephew of the lady who brought me up and educated me.\\nIt was he that made the match between me and our father: so if it had\\nnot been for him, child, you never would have been born.\"\\n\\n\"Oh that\\'s it,\" replied I.  \"Well, mother, if it had not been for me,\\nhe\\'d never have come into the shop, and found you.\"\\n\\n\"But, my child, we must be serious; you must be very respectful to\\nCaptain Delmar, and play no tricks with him; for you may see him very\\noften, and, perhaps, he will take a fancy to you; and if he does, he may\\ndo you a great deal of good, and bring you forward in the world; so\\npromise me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I\\'ll promise you I\\'ll leave him alone if you wish it.\\nLaw, mother, you should have seen how the middy laughed at him; it was\\nreal fun to make a gallant captain run in the way he did.\"\\n\\n\"Go along, you mischievous animal, and recollect your promise to me,\"\\nsaid my mother, as she went into the shop where she found that Captain\\nBridgeman, to whom she intended to explain how it was that she had\\ndropped the tumbler of water, had gone away.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of consultation between my grandmother and my\\nmother on that evening; my aunt and I were sent out to to take a walk,\\nthat we might not overhear what passed, and when we returned we found\\nthem still in close conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar was now a frequent visitor to my mother,\\nand a good customer to the library.  He did, however, generally contrive\\nthat his visit should be paid late in the afternoon, just after the\\nmarine officers had retired to dress for dinner; for he was a very\\nhaughty personage, and did not think it proper for any officers of an\\ninferior grade to come \"between the wind and his nobility.\"\\n\\nI cannot say that I was partial to him; indeed, his pomposity, as I\\nconsidered it, was to me a source of ridicule and dislike.  He took more\\nnotice of me than he did of anybody else; but he appeared to consider\\nthat his condescending patronage was all that was necessary; whereas,\\nhad he occasionally given me a half-crown I should have cherished better\\nfeelings towards him: not that I wanted money, for my mother supplied me\\nvery liberally, considering my age: but although you may coax and\\nflatter a girl into loving you, you cannot a boy, who requires more\\nsubstantial proofs of your good-will.\\n\\nThere were a great many remarks not very flattering to my mother, made\\nbehind her back, as to her former intimacy with Captain Delmar; for,\\nsomehow or another, there always is somebody who knows something,\\nwherever doubts or surmises arise, and so it was in this case; but if\\npeople indulged in ill-natured remarks when she was not there, they did\\nnot in her presence; on the contrary, the friendship of so great a man\\nas the Honourable Captain Delmar appeared rather to make my mother a\\nperson of more consequence.\\n\\nShe was continually pointing out to me the propriety of securing the\\ngood will of this great personage, and the more she did so, the more I\\nfelt inclined to do the reverse; indeed, I should have broke out into\\nopen mutiny, if it had not been for Captain Bridgeman, who sided with my\\nmother, and when I went to him to propose playing another trick upon the\\nnoble captain, not only refused to aid me, but told me, if I ever\\nthought of such a thing, he would never allow me to come to his rooms\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Why, what good can he do to me?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"He may advance you properly in life--who knows?--he may put you on the\\nquarter-deck, and get you promoted in the service.\"\\n\\n\"What, make a middy of me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and from a midshipman you may rise to be a post-captain, or\\nadmiral,--a much greater rank than I shall ever obtain,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman; \"so take my advice, and do as your mother wishes; be very\\ncivil and respectful to Captain Delmar, and he may be as good as a\\nfather to you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not saying much,\" replied I, thinking of my father Ben; \"I\\'d\\nrather have two mothers than two fathers.\"  And here the conversation\\nended.\\n\\nI had contracted a great alliance with Mr Dott, the midshipman, who\\nfollowed Captain Delmar about, just as Bob used to follow me, and\\ngenerally remained in the shop or outside with me, when his captain\\ncalled upon my mother.  He was a little wag, as full of mischief as\\nmyself, and even his awe of his captain, which, as a youngster in the\\nservice, was excessive, would not prevent him from occasionally breaking\\nout.  My mother took great notice of him, and when he could obtain leave\\n(which, indeed, she often asked for him), invited him to come to our\\nhouse, when he became my companion during his stay; we would sally out\\ntogether, and vie with each other in producing confusion and mirth at\\nother people\\'s expense; we became the abhorrence of every old\\nfruit-woman and beggar in the vicinity.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar heard occasionally of my pranks, and looked very majestic\\nand severe; but as I was not a middy, I cared little for his frowns.  At\\nlast an opportunity offered which I could not resist; and, not daring to\\nmake known my scheme either to Captain Bridgeman or Aunt Milly, I\\nconfided it to Tommy Dott, the little middy, who, regardless of the\\nconsequences, joined me in it heart and soul.\\n\\nThe theatre had been opened at Chatham, and had met with indifferent\\nsuccess.  I went there once with my aunt Milly, and twice with Mr Dott;\\nI, therefore, knew my _locale_ well.  It appeared that one of the female\\nperformers, whose benefit was shortly to take place, was very anxious to\\nobtain the patronage of Captain Delmar, and, with the usual tact of\\nwomen, had applied to my mother in the most obsequious manner,\\nrequesting her to espouse her cause with the gallant captain.\\n\\nMy mother, pleased with the idea of becoming, as it were, a patroness\\nunder the rose, did so effectually exert her influence over the captain,\\nthat, in a day or two afterwards, play-bills were posted all over the\\ntown, announcing that the play of _The Stranger_, with the farce of\\n_Raising the Wind_, would be performed on Friday evening, for the\\nbenefit of Miss Mortimer under the patronage of the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar, and the officers of his Majesty\\'s ship Calliope.  Of course the\\ngrateful young lady sent my mother some tickets of admission, and two of\\nthem I reserved for Tommy Dott and myself.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had made a large party of ladies, and of course all the\\nofficers of the ship attended: the house was as full as it could hold.\\nMy mother and aunt were there in a retired part of the boxes; Tommy Dott\\nand I entered the theatre with them, and afterwards had gone up to what\\nis, at the theatres at seaports, usually denominated the slips, that is,\\nthe sides of the theatre on the same range as the gallery.  There was\\nCaptain Delmar with all his ladies and all his officers, occupying\\nnearly the whole of the side of the dress circle below us, we having\\ntaken our position above him, so that we might not be observed.\\n\\nThe performance commenced.  Miss Mortimer, as _Mrs Haller_, was very\\neffective; and in the last scene was compelling the eyes of the company\\nto water, when we thought we would produce a still greater effect.\\n\\nWe had purchased a pound of the finest Scotch snuff, which we had\\nenclosed in two pasteboard cases, similar in form to those of squibs,\\nonly about six times the size, and holding half a pound of snuff each.\\nOur object was, in doing this, that, by jerking it all out with a heave,\\nwe might at once throw it right into the centre of the theatre above, so\\nthat in its descent it might be fairly distributed among all parties.\\n\\nThere was no one in the slips with us, except midshipmen, and a\\ndescription of people who would consider it a good joke, and never would\\npeach if they perceived we were the culprits.\\n\\nAt a signal between us, just as _Mrs Haller_ was giving a paper to her\\nhusband did we give our shower of snuff to the audience, jerking it\\nright across the theatre.  In a few minutes the effect was prodigious;\\nCaptain Delmar\\'s party being right beneath us, probably received a\\ngreater share, for they commenced sneezing fast, then the boxes on the\\nother side, the pit followed, and at last _Mr and Mrs Haller_ and the\\n_Stranger_ were taken with such a fit of sneezing that they could no\\nlonger talk to each other.\\n\\nThe children were brought out to their parents to effect their\\nreconciliation, but they did nothing but sneeze, poor things; and at\\nlast the uproar was tremendous, and the curtain was dropped, not to loud\\nplaudits, but to loud sneezings from every part of the theatre.\\n\\nNever was there anything so ludicrous; the manager sent officers up to\\ndiscover the offenders but no one could tell who had played the trick;\\nhe then came before the curtain to make a speech upon the occasion, but,\\nhaving sneezed seven or eight times, he was obliged to retire with his\\nhandkerchief to his nose; and the audience, finding it impossible to\\ncheck the titillation of the olfactory nerves, abandoned the theatre as\\nfast as they could, leaving the farce of _Raising the Wind_ to be\\nperformed to empty beaches.\\n\\nI hardly need say, that as soon as we had thrown the snuff, Mr Dott and\\nI had gone down and taken our places very demurely in the box by the\\nside of my mother, and appeared just as astonished, and indeed added as\\nmuch as possible to the company of sneezers.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was very furious at this want of respect of certain\\nparties unknown, and had we been discovered, whatever might have been my\\nfate, it would have gone hard with Tommy Dott; but we kept our own\\ncounsel, and escaped.\\n\\nThat I was suspected by Aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman is certain, and\\nmy aunt taxed me with it, but I would not confess; my mother also had\\nher suspicions, but as Captain Delmar had none, that was of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nThe success of this trick was a great temptation to try another or two\\nupon the noble captain.  He was, however saved by the simple fact of\\nH.M. ship Calliope being reported manned and ready for sea; orders were\\nsent down for his going round to Portsmouth to await the commands of the\\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and Captain Delmar came to pay his\\nfarewell visit.\\n\\nThe report from the schoolmaster had been very favourable and Captain\\nDelmar then asked me, for the first time, if I would like to be a\\nsailor.  As Captain Bridgeman had advised me not to reject any good\\noffer on the part of the honourable captain, I answered in the\\naffirmative; whereupon the captain replied, that if I paid attention to\\nmy learning, in a year\\'s time he would take me with him on board of his\\nfrigate.\\n\\nHe then patted my head, forgot to give me half a crown, and, shaking\\nhands with my mother and aunt, quitted the house, followed by Tommy\\nDott, who, as he went away, turned and laughed his adieu.\\n\\nI have not mentioned my grandmother lately.  The fact is, that when\\nCaptain Delmar made his appearance, for some cause or another, which I\\ncould not comprehend, she declared her intention of going away and\\npaying a visit to her old acquaintances at the Hall.  She did so.  As I\\nafterwards found out from what I overheard, she had a very great\\naversion to the noble captain: but the cause of her aversion was never\\ncommunicated to me.  Soon after the sailing of the Calliope, she again\\nmade her appearance, took her old seat in the easy-chair, and resumed\\nher eternal knitting as before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\\n\\nAnother year of my existence passed rapidly away; I was nearly thirteen\\nyears old, a sturdy bold boy, well fitted for the naval profession,\\nwhich I now considered decided upon, and began to be impatient to leave\\nschool, and wondered that we heard nothing of Captain Delmar, when news\\nwas received from another quarter.\\n\\nOne morning Captain Bridgeman came much earlier than usual, and with a\\nvery grave face put on especially for the occasion.  I had not set off\\nfor school, and ran up to him; but he checked me, and said, \"I must see\\nyour mother directly, I have very important news for her.\"\\n\\nI went in to tell my mother, who requested Captain Bridgeman to come\\ninto the parlour, and not being aware of the nature of the\\ncommunication, ordered Aunt Milly and me into the shop; we waited for\\nsome minutes, and then Captain Bridgeman made his appearance.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"Read this newspaper,\" said he; \"there is a despatch from India, it will\\ntell you all about it, and you can show it to your sister, when she is\\nmore composed.\"\\n\\nCurious to know what the matter could be, I quitted the shop, and went\\ninto the parlour, where I saw my mother with her face buried in the sofa\\npillow, and apparently in great distress.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, mother?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh! my child, my child!\" replied my mother, wringing her hands, \"you\\nare an orphan, and I am a lonely widow.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said my grandmother, \"why, are you such a fool, as not to\\nunderstand that your father is dead?\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead, is he?\" replied I, \"I\\'ll go and tell Aunt Milly;\" and\\naway I went out of the parlour to Milly, whom I found reading the\\nnewspaper.\\n\\n\"Aunt,\" said I, \"father\\'s dead, only to think!  I wonder how he died!\"\\n\\n\"He was killed in action, dear,\" said my aunt; \"look here, here is the\\naccount, and the list of killed and wounded.  D\\'ye see your father\\'s\\nname--Benjamin Keene, marine?\"\\n\\n\"Let me read all about it, Aunt Milly,\" replied I, taking the paper from\\nher; and I was soon very busy with the account of the action.\\n\\nMy readers must not suppose that I had no feeling, because I showed none\\nat my father\\'s death; if they call to mind the humble position in which\\nI had always seen my father, who dared not even intrude upon the\\npresence of those with whom my mother and I were on familiar terms, and\\nthat he was ordered about just like a servant by my mother, who set me\\nno example of fear or love for him, they will easily imagine that I felt\\nless for his death than I should have for that of Captain Bridgeman, or\\nmany others with whom I was on intimate terms.\\n\\nWhat did puzzle me was, that my mother should show so much feeling on\\nthe occasion.  I did not know the world then, and that decency required\\na certain display of grief.  Aunt Milly appeared to be very unconcerned\\nabout it, although, occasionally, she was in deep thought.  I put down\\nthe paper as soon as I had read the despatch, and said to her, \"Well, I\\nsuppose I must go to school now, aunt?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, dear,\" replied she, \"you can\\'t go to school for a few days now--\\nit wouldn\\'t be proper; you must remain at home and wait till you have\\nput on mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, at all events,\" replied I; \"I wonder where Captain\\nDelmar is, and why he don\\'t send for me; I begin to hate school.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say it won\\'t be long before you hear from him, dear,\" replied my\\naunt; \"stay here and mind the shop, while I go in to your mother.\"\\n\\nIf the truth was told, I am afraid that the death of Ben was a source of\\ncongratulation to all parties who were then in the parlour.  As for me,\\nI was very glad to have a few days\\' holiday, being perfectly indifferent\\nas to whether he was dead or alive.\\n\\nWhen I went in I found them in consultation as to the mourning: my\\nmother did not, in the first place, wish to make any a parade about a\\nhusband of whom she was ashamed; in the second, she did not like widow\\'s\\nweeds, and the unbecoming cap.  So it was decided, as Ben had been dead\\nsix months, and if they had known it before they would have been in\\nmourning for him all that time, that half-mourning was all that was\\nrequisite for them; and that, as for me, there was no reason for my\\ngoing into mourning at all.\\n\\nThree days after the intelligence, my mother re-appeared in the shop;\\nthe reason why she did not appear before was, that her dress was not\\nready--she looked very pretty indeed in half-mourning, so did my Aunt\\nMilly; and the attentions of the marine corps, especially Captain\\nBridgeman and Lieutenant Flat, were more unremitting than ever.\\n\\nIt appeared that, as the death of Ben had removed the great difficulty\\nto my aunt\\'s being married to an officer, my grandmother had resolved to\\nascertain the intentions of Captain Bridgeman, and if she found that he\\ncried off, to persuade Milly to consent to become Mrs Flat.  Whether\\nshe consulted my mother or my aunt on this occasion, I cannot positively\\nsay, but I rather think not.\\n\\nMy mother and my aunt were walking out one evening, when Captain\\nBridgeman came in, and my grandmother, who remained in the shop whenever\\nmy mother and Milly went out together, which was very seldom, requested\\nhim to walk into the back parlour, desiring me to remain in the shop,\\nand let her know if she was wanted.\\n\\nNow when they went into the parlour, the door was left ajar, and, as I\\nremained at the back part of the shop, I could not help over-hearing\\nevery word which was said; for my grandmother being very deaf, as most\\ndeaf people do, talked quite as loud as Captain Bridgeman was compelled\\nto do, to make her hear him.\\n\\n\"I wish, Captain Bridgeman, as a friend, to ask your advice relative to\\nmy daughter Amelia,\" said the old lady.  \"Please to take a chair.\"\\n\\n\"If there is any opinion that I can offer on the subject, madam, I shall\\nbe most happy to give it,\" replied the captain, sitting down as\\nrequested.\\n\\n\"You see, my daughter Amelia has been well brought up, and carefully\\neducated, as was, indeed, my daughter, Arabella, through the kindness of\\nmy old patron, Mrs Delmar, the aunt of the Honourable Captain Delmar,\\nwhom you have often met here, and who is heir to the title of de\\nVersely; that is to say, his eldest brother has no children.  I have\\nbeen nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential, Captain\\nBridgeman; the old lord was very fond of my husband, who was his\\nsteward, but he died, poor man, a long while ago; I am sure it would\\nhave broken his heart, if, in his lifetime, my daughter Arabella had\\nmade the foolish marriage which she did with a private marine--however,\\nwhat\\'s done can\\'t be helped, as the saying is--that\\'s all over now.\"\\n\\n\"It was certainly a great pity that Mrs Keene should have been so\\nfoolish,\" replied Captain Bridgeman, \"but, as you say, that is all over\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; God\\'s will be done, Captain Bridgeman; now you see, sir, that this\\nmarriage of Bella\\'s has done no good to the prospects of her sister\\nAmelia, who, nevertheless, is a good and pretty girl though I say it,\\nwho am her mother; and moreover, she will bring a pretty penny to her\\nhusband whoever he may be; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, my husband\\nwas not idle during the time that he was in the family of the Delmars,\\nand as her sister is so well to do, why little Amelia will come into a\\ngreater share than she otherwise would--that is, if she marries well,\\nand according to the wishes of her mother.\"\\n\\nAt this interesting part of the conversation Captain Bridgeman leant\\nmore earnestly towards my grandmother.\\n\\n\"A pretty penny, madam, you said; I never heard the expression before;\\nwhat may a pretty penny mean?\"\\n\\n\"It means, first and last, 4,000 pounds, Captain Bridgeman; part down,\\nand the other when I die.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"I certainly never thought that\\nMiss Amelia would ever have any fortune; indeed, she\\'s too pretty and\\naccomplished to require any.\"\\n\\n\"Now, sir,\" continued my grandmother, \"the point on which I wish to\\nconsult you is this: you know that Lieutenant Flat is very often here,\\nand for a long while has been very attentive to my daughter; he has, I\\nbelieve, almost as much as proposed--that is, in his sort of way; but my\\ndaughter does not seem to care for him.  Now, Captain Bridgeman, Mr\\nFlat may not be very clever, but I believe him to be a very worthy young\\nman; still one must be cautious, and what I wish to know before I\\ninterfere and persuade my daughter to marry him is, whether you think\\nthat Mr Flat is of a disposition which would make the marriage state a\\nhappy one; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, love before marriage is very\\napt to fly away, but love that comes after marriage will last out your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Well, madam,\" replied the captain, \"I will be candid with you; I do not\\nthink that a clever girl like Miss Amelia is likely to be happy as the\\nwife of my good friend Mr Flat--still there is nothing against his\\ncharacter, madam; I believe him harmless--very harmless.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a very fine-looking young man, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nothing to be found fault with in his appearance.\"\\n\\n\"Very good-natured.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he\\'s not very quick in temper, or anything else; he\\'s what we call\\na slow-coach.\"\\n\\n\"I hear he\\'s a very correct officer, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I am not aware that he has ever been under an arrest.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we cannot expect everything in this world; he is handsome,\\ngood-tempered, and a good officer--I cannot see why Amelia does not like\\nhim, particularly as her affections are not otherwise engaged.  I am\\nsatisfied with the answer you have given, Captain Bridgeman, and now I\\nshall point out to Amelia that I expect she will make up her mind to\\naccept Mr Flat.\"\\n\\nHere Captain Bridgeman hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam, if her affections are not otherwise engaged--I say--are\\nnot engaged, madam, I do not think she could do better.  Would, you like\\nme to sound Miss Amelia on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Really, Captain Bridgeman, it is very kind of you; you may, perhaps,\\npersuade her to listen to your friend Mr Flat.\"\\n\\n\"I will, at all events, ascertain her real sentiments, madam,\" said the\\ncaptain, rising; \"and, if you please, I will say farewell for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nAs my grandmother anticipated, the scale, which had been so long\\nbalanced by Captain Bridgeman, was weighed down in favour of marriage by\\nthe death of my father Ben, and the unexpected fortune of 4,000 pounds.\\n\\nThe next day the captain proposed and was accepted, and six weeks from\\nthat date my aunt Milly became his wife.\\n\\nThe wedding was very gay: some people did sneer at the match, but where\\nwas there ever a match without a sneer?  There are always and everywhere\\npeople to be found who will envy the happiness of others.  Some talked\\nabout the private marine; this attack was met with the 4,000 pounds (or\\nrather 8,000 pounds per annum, for rumour, as usual, had doubled the\\nsum); others talked of the shop as _infra dig_; the set-off against\\nwhich was, the education and beauty of the bride.  One or two subs\\'\\nwives declared that they would not visit Mrs Bridgeman; but when the\\ncolonel and his lady called to congratulate the new-married couple, and\\ninvited a large party in their own house to meet them, then then subs\\'\\nwives left their cards as soon as they could.\\n\\nIn a few weeks all was right again: my mother would not give up her\\nshop--it was too lucrative; but she was on more intimate terms with her\\ncustomers; and when people found that, although her sister was a\\ncaptain\\'s lady, my mother had too much sense to be ashamed of her\\nposition; why they liked her the better.  Indeed, as she was still very\\nhandsome, one or two of the marine officers, now that she was a widow,\\npaid her very assiduous court; but my mother had no intention of\\nentering again into the holy state--she preferred STATE _in quo_.  She\\nhad no one to care for but me, and for me she continued her shop and\\nlibrary, although, I believe, she could have retired upon a comfortable\\nindependence, had she chosen so to do.\\n\\nMy mother, whatever she might have been when a girl, was now a\\nstrong-minded, clever woman.  It must have been a painful thing for her\\nto have made up her mind to allow me to go to sea; I was her only child,\\nher only care; I believe she loved me dearly, although she was not so\\nlavish of her caresses as my aunt Milly; but she perceived that it would\\nbe for my advantage that I should insure the patronage and protection of\\nCaptain Delmar, and she sacrificed self to my interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\\n\\nAbout a month after my aunt\\'s marriage, a letter was received from\\nCaptain Delmar, who had arrived at Spithead, requesting my mother to\\nsend me to Portsmouth as soon as she could, and not go to the trouble or\\nexpense of fitting me out, as he would take that upon himself.\\n\\nThis was but short notice to give a fond mother, but there was no help\\nfor it; she returned an answer, that in three days from the date of the\\nletter I should be there.\\n\\nI was immediately summoned from school that she might see as much of me\\nas possible before I went; and although she did not attempt to detain\\nme, I perceived, very often, the tears run down her cheeks.\\n\\nMy grandmother thought proper to make me very long speeches every three\\nor four hours, the substance of which may be comprehended in very few\\nwords--to wit, that I had been a very bad boy, and that I was little\\nbetter now; that I had been spoiled by over-indulgence, and that it was\\nlucky my aunt Milly was not so much with me; that on board a man-of-war\\nI dare not play tricks, and that I would find it very different from\\nbeing at home with my mother; that Captain Delmar was a very great man,\\nand that I must be very respectful to him; that some day I should thank\\nher very much for her being so kind to me; that she hoped I would behave\\nwell, and that if I did not, she hoped that I would get a good beating.\\n\\nSuch was the burden of her song, till at last I got very tired of it,\\nand on the third evening I broke away from her, saying, \"Law, granny how\\nyou do twaddle!\" upon which she called me a good-for-nothing young\\nblackguard, and felt positively sure that I should be hanged.  The\\nconsequence was, that granny and I did not part good friends; and I\\nsincerely hoped that when I had come back again, I should not find her\\nabove ground.\\n\\nThe next morning I bade farewell to my dear Aunt Milly and Captain\\nBridgeman, received a very ungracious salute from granny, who appeared\\nto think, as she kissed me, that her lips were touching something\\npoisonous, and set off with my mother in the coach to Portsmouth.\\n\\nWe arrived safe at Portsmouth, and my mother immediately took lodgings\\non the Common Hard at Portsea.  The next day, having dressed herself\\nwith great care, with a very thick veil on her bonnet, my mother walked\\nwith me to the George Hotel, where Captain Delmar had taken up his\\nquarters.\\n\\nOn my mother sending up her card, we were immediately ushered upstairs,\\nand on entering the room found the Honourable Captain Delmar sitting\\ndown in full uniform--his sword, and hat, and numerous papers, lying on\\nthe table before him.  On one side of the table stood a lieutenant, hat\\nin hand; on the other, the captain\\'s clerk, with papers for him to sign.\\nMy friend Tommy Dott was standing at the window, chasing a blue-bottle\\nfly, for want of something better to do; and the steward was waiting for\\norders behind the captain\\'s chair.\\n\\nMy mother, who had pulled down her veil, so that her face was not\\nvisible, made a slight courtesy to Captain Delmar, who rose up and\\nadvanced to receive her very graciously, requesting that she would be\\nseated for a minute or two, till he had time to speak to her.\\n\\nI have thought since, that my honourable captain had a mind to impress\\nupon my mother the state and dignity of a captain in his Majesty\\'s\\nservice, when in commission.  He took no notice whatever of me.  Tommy\\nDott gave me a wink of his eye from the window, and I returned the\\ncompliment by putting my tongue into my cheek; but the other parties\\nwere too much occupied with the captain to perceive our friendly\\nrecognition.  Captain Delmar continued to give various orders, and after\\na time the officers attending were dismissed.\\n\\nAs soon as we were alone, my mother was addressed in, I thought, rather\\na pompous way, and very much in contrast with his previous politeness\\nbefore others.  Captain Delmar informed her that he should take me\\nimmediately under his protection, pay all my expenses, and, if I behaved\\nwell, advance me in the service.\\n\\nAt this announcement, my mother expressed a great deal of gratitude,\\nand, shedding a few tears, said, that the boy would in future look up to\\nhim as a parent.  To this speech Captain Delmar made no reply; but,\\nchanging the conversation, told her that he expected to sail in about\\nthree or four days, and that no time must be lost in fitting me out;\\nthat, all things considered, he thought it advisable that she should\\nreturn at once to Chatham, and leave the boy with him as she could not\\nknow what was requisite for me, and would therefore be of no use.\\n\\nAt the idea of parting with me, my mother cried bitterly.  Captain\\nDelmar did then rise off his chair, and taking my mother by the hand\\nspeak to her a few words of consolation.  My mother removed her\\nhandkerchief from her eyes and sighed deeply, saying to Captain Delmar,\\nwith an appealing look, \"Oh!  Captain Delmar, remember that for you I\\nhave indeed made great sacrifices; do not forget them, when you look at\\nthat boy, who is very dear to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will do him justice,\" replied the captain, somewhat affected, \"but I\\nmust insist upon inviolable secrecy on your part; you must promise me\\nthat under any circumstances--\"\\n\\n\"I have obeyed you for thirteen years,\" replied my mother; \"I am not\\nlikely to forget my promise now; it is hard to part with him, but I\\nleave him in the hands of--\"\\n\\n\"You forget the boy is there,\" interrupted Captain Delmar; \"take him\\naway now; to-morrow morning I will send my coxswain for him, and you\\nmust go back to Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"God bless you, sir,\" replied my mother, weeping, as Captain Delmar\\nshook her hand, and then we left the room.  As we were walking back to\\nour lodging, I inquired of my mother--\"What\\'s the secret between you and\\nCaptain Delmar, mother?\"\\n\\n\"The secret, child!  Oh, something which took place at the time I was\\nliving with his aunt, and which he does not wish to have known; so ask\\nme no more questions about it.\"\\n\\nAfter our return, my mother gave me a great deal of advice.  She told me\\nthat, as I had lost my father Ben, I must now look upon Captain Delmar\\nas a father to me; that Ben had been a faithful servant to the captain,\\nand that she had been the same to Mrs Delmar, his aunt; and that was\\nthe reason why Captain Delmar was interested about me, and had promised\\nto do so much for me; begging me to treat him with great respect and\\nnever venture to play him any tricks, or otherwise he would be highly\\noffended, and send me home again; and then I should never rise to be an\\nofficer in his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\nI cannot say the advice received the attention it deserved, for I felt\\nmore inclined to play tricks to my honourable captain than any person I\\never met with; however, I appeared to consent, and, in return begged my\\nmother to take care of my dog Bob, which she promised to do.\\n\\nMy mother cried a great deal during the night; the next morning she gave\\nme five guineas as pocket-money, recommending me to be careful of it,\\nand telling me I must look to Captain Delmar for my future supply.  She\\ntied up the little linen I had brought with me in a handkerchief, and\\nshortly after the coxswain knocked at the door, and came upstairs to\\nclaim me for his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\n\"I\\'m come for the youngster, if you please, marm,\" said the coxswain, a\\nfine, tall seaman, remarkably clean and neat in his dress.\\n\\nMy mother put her arms round me, and burst into tears.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, marm,\" said the coxswain, after standing silent\\nabout a minute, \"but could not you _do the piping_ after the youngster\\'s\\ngone?  If I stay here long I shall be blowed up by the skipper, as sure\\nas my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\n\"I will detain you but a few seconds longer,\" replied my mother; \"I may\\nnever see him again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s a fact; my poor mother never did me,\" replied the\\ncoxswain.\\n\\nThis observation did not raise my mother\\'s spirits.  Another pause\\nensued, during which I was bedewed with her tears, when the coxswain\\napproached again--\\n\\n\"I ax your pardon, marm; but if you know anything of Captain Delmar, you\\nmust know he\\'s not a man to be played with, and you would not wish to\\nget me into trouble.  It\\'s a hard thing to part with a child, I\\'m told,\\nbut it wouldn\\'t help me if I said anything about your tears.  If the\\ncaptain were to go to the boat, and find me not there, he\\'d just say,\\n`What were my orders, sir?\\' and after that, you know, marm, there is not\\na word for me to say.\"\\n\\n\"Take him, then, my good man,\" replied my mother, pressing me\\nconvulsively to her heart--\"take him; Heaven bless you, my dear child.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kind of you,\" replied the coxswain.  \"Come, my\\nlittle fellow, we\\'ll soon make a man of you.\"\\n\\nI once more pressed my lips to my poor mother\\'s, and she resigned me to\\nthe coxswain, at the same time taking some silver off the table and\\nputting it into his hand.\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kinder still, to think of another when you\\'re in\\ndistress yourself; I shan\\'t forget it.  I\\'ll look after the lad a bit\\nfor you, as sure as my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\nMy mother sank down on the sofa, with her handkerchief to her eyes.\\n\\nBob Cross caught up the bundle, and led me away.  I was very melancholy,\\nfor I loved my mother, and could not bear to see her so distressed, and\\nfor some time we walked on without speaking.\\n\\nThe coxswain first broke the silence:--\"What\\'s your name, my little\\nTrojan?\" said he.\\n\\n\"Percival Keene.\"\\n\\n\"Well I\\'m blessed if I didn\\'t think that you were one of the Delmar\\nbreed, by the cut of your jib; howsomever, it\\'s a wise child that knows\\nits own father.\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Dead!  Well, fathers do die sometimes; you must get on how you can\\nwithout one.  I don\\'t think fathers are of much use, for, you see,\\nmothers take care of you till you\\'re old enough to go to sea.  My father\\ndid nothing for me, except to help mother to lick me, when I was\\nobstropolous.\"\\n\\nThe reader, from what he has already been informed about Ben, the\\nmarine, may easily conceive that I was very much of Bob Cross\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\"I suppose you don\\'t know anybody on board--do you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know Tommy Dott--I knew him when the ship was at Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr Tommy Dott; I dare say you\\'re just like him, for you look full\\nof mischief.  He\\'s a very nice young man for a small party, as the\\nsaying is; there is more devil in his little carcase than in two\\nwomen\\'s, and that\\'s not a trifle; you\\'ll hunt in couples, I dare say,\\nand get well flogged at the same gun, if you don\\'t take care.  Now, here\\nwe are, and I must report my arrival with you under convoy.\"\\n\\nBob Cross sent a waiter for the captain\\'s steward, who went up to\\nCaptain Delmar.  I was ordered to go upstairs, and again found myself in\\nthe presence of the noble captain, and a very stout elderly man, with a\\nflaxen wig.\\n\\n\"This is the lad,\" said Captain Delmar, when I came into the room and\\nwalked up to him; \"you know exactly what he requires; oblige me by\\nseeing him properly fitted out and the bill sent in to me.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" said the old\\ngentleman, with a profound bow.\\n\\n\"You had better not order too many things, as he is growing fast; it\\nwill be easy to make good any deficiencies as they may be required.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be most strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" replied the\\nold gentleman, with another bow.\\n\\n\"I hardly know what to do with him for to-day and to-morrow, until his\\nuniforms are made,\" continued the captain: \"I suppose he must go on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"If you have no objection, Captain Delmar,\" said the old gentleman, with\\nanother low bow, \"I am sure that Mrs Culpepper will be most proud to\\ntake charge of any _protege_ of yours; we have a spare bed, and the\\nyoung gentleman can remain with us until he is ready to embark in the\\nuniform of his rank.\"\\n\\n\"Be it so, Mr Culpepper; let your wife take care of him until all is\\ncomplete, and his chest is ready.  You\\'ll oblige me by arranging about\\nhis mess.\"\\n\\n\"Your wishes shall be most strictly attended to, Captain Delmar,\"\\nreplied Mr Culpepper, with another profound inclination, which made me\\nfeel very much inclined to laugh.\\n\\n\"If you have no further orders, Captain Delmar, I will now take the\\nyoung gentleman with me.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more, Mr Culpepper--good morning,\" replied Captain Delmar, who\\nneither said how d\\'ye do to me when I came in, or good bye when I went\\naway in company with Mr Culpepper.  I had yet to learn what a thing of\\nno consequence was a \"sucking Nelson.\"\\n\\nI followed Mr Culpepper down stairs, who desired me to remain with the\\ncoxswain, who was standing under the archway, while he spoke to the\\ncaptain\\'s steward.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob Cross, \"what\\'s the ticket, youngster,--are you to go\\nabroad with me?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I; \"I am to stay on shore with that old chap, who does\\nnothing but bob his head up and down.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s our nipcheese.\"\\n\\n\"Nipcheese!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nipcheese means purser of the ship--you\\'ll find all that out\\nby-and-by; you\\'ve got lots to larn, and, by way of a hint, make him your\\nfriend if you can, for he earwigs the captain in fine style.\"\\n\\nPerceiving that I did not understand him, Bob Cross continued: \"I mean\\nthat our captain\\'s very fond of the officers paying him great respect,\\nand he likes all that bowing and scraping; he don\\'t like officers or men\\nto touch their hats, but to take them right off their heads when they\\nspeak to him.  You see, he\\'s a sprig of nobility, as they call it, and\\nwhat\\'s more he\\'s also a post-captain, and thinks no small beer of\\nhimself; so don\\'t forget what I say--here comes the purser.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper now came out, and, taking my hand, led me away to his own\\nhouse, which was at Southsea.  He did not speak a word during the walk,\\nbut appeared to be in deep cogitation: at last we arrived at his door.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\\n\\nWhy is it that I detain the reader with Mr Culpepper and his family?  I\\ndon\\'t know, but I certainly have an inclination to linger over every\\nlittle detail of events which occurred upon my first plunging into the\\nsea of life, just as naked boys on the New River side stand shivering a\\nwhile, before they can make up their minds to dash into the unnatural\\nelement; for men are not ducks, although they do show some affinity to\\ngeese by their venturing upon the treacherous fluid.\\n\\nThe door was opened, and I found myself in the presence of Mrs\\nCulpepper and her daughter,--the heiress, as I afterwards discovered, to\\nall Mr Culpepper\\'s savings, which were asserted to be something\\nconsiderable after thirty years\\' employment as purser of various vessels\\nbelonging to his Majesty.\\n\\nMrs Culpepper was in person enormous--she looked like a feather-bed\\nstanding on end; her cheeks were as large as a dinner-plate, eyes almost\\nas imperceptible as a mole\\'s, nose just visible, mouth like a round O.\\nIt was said that she was once a great Devonshire beauty.  Time, who has\\nbeen denominated _Edax rerum_, certainly had as yet left her untouched,\\nreserving her for a _bonne bouche_ on some future occasion.\\n\\nShe sat in a very large arm-chair--indeed, no common-sized chair could\\nhave received her capacious person.  She did not get up when I entered;\\nindeed, as I discovered, she made but two attempts to stand during the\\ntwenty-four hours; one was to come out of her bedroom, which was on the\\nsame floor as the parlour, and the other to go in again.\\n\\nMiss Culpepper was somewhat of her mother\\'s build.  She might have been\\ntwenty years old, and was, for a girl of her age, exuberantly fat; yet\\nas her skin and complexion were not coarse, many thought her handsome;\\nbut she promised to be as large as her mother, and certainly was not at\\nall suited for a wife to a subaltern of a marching regiment.\\n\\n\"Who have we here?\" said Mrs Culpepper to her husband, in a sort of low\\ncroak; for she was so smothered with fat that she could not get her\\nvoice out.\\n\\n\"Well, I hardly know,\" replied the gentleman, wiping his forehead; \"but\\nI\\'ve my own opinion.\"\\n\\n\"Mercy on me, how very like!\" exclaimed Miss Culpepper, looking at me,\\nand then at her father.  \"Would not you like to go into the garden,\\nlittle boy?\" continued she: \"there, through the passage, out of the\\ndoor,--you can\\'t miss it.\"\\n\\nAs this was almost a command, I did not refuse to go; but as soon as I\\nwas in the garden, which was a small patch of ground behind the house,\\nas the window to the parlour was open, and my curiosity was excited by\\ntheir evidently wishing to say something which they did not wish me to\\nhear, I stopped under the window and listened.\\n\\n\"The very picture of him,\" continued the young lady.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, very like indeed,\" croaked the old one.\\n\\n\"All I know is,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"Captain Delmar has desired me to\\nfit him out, and that he pays all the expenses.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s another proof,\" said the young lady; \"he wouldn\\'t pay for\\nother people\\'s children.\"\\n\\n\"He was brought down here by a very respectable-looking, I may say\\ninteresting, and rather pretty woman,--I should think about thirty.\"\\n\\n\"Then she must have been handsome when this boy was born,\" replied the\\nyoung lady: \"I consider that another proof.  Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"Went away this morning by the day-coach, leaving the boy with the\\ncaptain, who sent his coxswain for him.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s mystery about that,\" rejoined the daughter, \"and therefore I\\nconsider it another proof.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"and a strong one too.  Captain Delmar is so\\nhigh and mighty, that he would not have it thought that he could ever\\ncondescend to have an intrigue with one beneath him in rank and station,\\nand he has sent her away on that account, depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Just so; and if that boy is not a son of Captain Delmar, I\\'m not a\\nwoman.\"\\n\\n\"I am of that opinion,\" replied the father, \"and therefore I offered to\\ntake charge of him, as the captain did not know what to do with him till\\nhis uniform was ready.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied Miss Culpepper, \"I\\'ll soon find out more.  I\\'ll pump\\neverything that he knows out of him before he leaves us; I know how to\\nput that and that together.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" croaked the fat mother; \"Medea knows how to put that and that\\ntogether, as well as any one.\"\\n\\n\"You must be very civil and very kind to him,\" said Mr Culpepper; \"for\\ndepend upon it, the very circumstance of the captain\\'s being compelled\\nto keep the boy at a distance will make him feel more fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no patience with the men in that respect,\" observed the young\\nlady: \"how nobility can so demean themselves I can\\'t think; no wonder\\nthey are ashamed of what they have done, and will not acknowledge their\\nown offspring.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"If a woman has the misfortune to yield to her inclinations, they don\\'t\\nlet her off so easily,\" exclaimed Miss Medea.\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the mamma again.\\n\\n\"Men make the laws and break them,\" continued Miss Culpepper.  \"Mere\\nbrute strength, even in the most civilised society.  If all women had\\nonly the spirit that I have, there would be a little alteration, and\\nmore justice.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t pretend to argue with you, Medea,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"I\\ntake the world as I find it, and make the best of it.  I must go now,--\\nmy steward is waiting for me at the victualling office.  Just brush my\\nhat a little, Medea, the wind has raised the nap, and then I\\'ll be off.\"\\n\\nI walked very softly from the window; a new light had burst upon me.\\nYoung as I was, I also could put that and that together.  I called to\\nmind the conduct of my mother towards her husband Ben; the dislike of my\\ngrandmother to Captain Delmar; the occasional conversations I had\\noverheard; the question of my mother checked before it was finished--\"If\\nI knew who it was that I had been playing the trick to;\" the visits my\\nmother received from Captain Delmar, who was so haughty and distant to\\neverybody; his promise to provide for me, and my mother\\'s injunctions to\\nme to be obedient and look up to him as a father, and the remarks of the\\ncoxswain, Bob Cross,--\"If I were not of the Delmar breed:\" all this,\\nadded to what I had just overheard, satisfied me that they were not\\nwrong in their conjectures, and that I really was the son of the\\nhonourable captain.\\n\\nMy mother had gone; I would have given worlds to have gained this\\ninformation before, that I might have questioned her, and obtained the\\ntruth from her; but that was now impossible, and I felt convinced that\\nwriting was of no use.  I recollected the conversation between her and\\nthe Captain, in which she promised to keep the secret, and the answer\\nshe gave me when I questioned her; nothing, then, but my tears and\\nentreaties could have any effect, and those, I knew, were powerful over\\nher; neither would it be of any use to ask Aunt Milly, for she would not\\ntell her sister\\'s secrets, so I resolved to say nothing about it for the\\npresent; and I did not forget that Mr Culpepper had said that Captain\\nDelmar would be annoyed if it was supposed that I was his son; I\\nresolved, therefore, that I would not let him imagine that I knew\\nanything about it, or had any idea of it.\\n\\nI remained more than an hour in deep thought, and it was strange what a\\ntumult there was in my young heart at this discovery.  I hardly\\ncomprehended the nature of my position, yet I felt pleased on the whole;\\nI felt as if I were of more importance; nay, that I was more capable of\\nthinking and acting than I was twenty-four hours before.\\n\\nMy reveries were, however, disturbed by Miss Medea, who came to the\\nback-door and asked me if I was not tired of walking, and if I would not\\nlike to come in.\\n\\n\"Are you not hungry, Master Keene?  Would you like to have a nice piece\\nof cake and a glass of currant wine before dinner?  We shall not dine\\ntill three o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" replied I: for I would not refuse the bribe, although I\\nhad a perfect knowledge why it was offered.\\n\\nMiss Medea brought the cake and wine.  As soon as I had despatched them,\\nwhich did not take very long, she commenced her pumping, as I had\\nanticipated, and which I was determined to thwart, merely out of\\nopposition.\\n\\n\"You were sorry to leave your mamma, weren\\'t you, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; very sorry, miss.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your papa, dearest?  He\\'s a very pretty boy, mamma, ain\\'t he?\"\\ncontinued the young lady, putting her fingers through my chestnut curls.\\n\\n\"Yes; handsome boy,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"Papa\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead!  I thought so,\" observed Miss Medea, winking at her mother.\\n\\n\"Did you ever see your papa, dearest?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; he went to sea about eighteen months ago, and he was killed in\\naction.\"\\n\\nAfter this came on a series of questions and cross-questions; I replied\\nto her so as to make it appear that Ben was my father, and nobody else,\\nalthough I had then a very different opinion.  The fact was, I was\\ndetermined that I would not be pumped, and I puzzled them, for I stated\\nthat my aunt Milly was married to Captain Bridgeman, of the marines; and\\nnot till then did Miss Medea ask me what my father was.  My reply was\\nthat he had also been in the marines, and they consequently put him down\\nas a marine officer, as well as Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nThis added so much to the respectability of my family, that they were\\nquite mystified, and found that it was not quite so easy to put that and\\nthat together as they had thought.\\n\\nAs soon as they were tired of questioning, they asked me if I would not\\nlike to take another turn in the garden, to which I consented; and,\\nplacing myself under the window as before, I heard Miss Medea say to her\\nmother--\\n\\n\"Father\\'s always finding out some mare\\'s nest or another; and because\\nthere is some likeness to the captain, he has, in his great wit, made an\\nimportant discovery.  It\\'s quite evident that he\\'s wrong, as he\\ngenerally is.  It\\'s not very likely that Captain Delmar should have had\\nan intrigue with the wife of a marine officer, and her sister married\\nalso into the corps.  The widow has brought him down herself, it is\\ntrue, but that proves nothing; who else was to bring him down, if it was\\nnot his mother? and the very circumstance of her going away so soon\\nproves that she felt it improper that she should remain; and, in my\\nopinion, that she is a modest, interesting young woman, in whom Captain\\nDelmar has taken an interest.  I wish father would not come here with\\nhis nonsensical ideas, telling us to make much of the boy.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Medea,\" replied the mother; \"you might have saved that cake\\nand wine.\"\\n\\nThinks I to myself, you have not pumped me, and I never felt more\\ndelighted than at having outwitted them.  I thought it, however, prudent\\nto walk away from the window.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, Mr Culpepper returned, accompanied by one of the\\nnumerous Portsmouth fitting-out tailors.  I was summoned; the tailor\\npresented a list of what he declared to be absolutely necessary for the\\noutfit of a gentleman.\\n\\nMr Culpepper struck out two-thirds of the articles, and desired the\\nremainder to be ready on the Friday morning, it being then Wednesday.\\nThe tailor promised faithfully, and Mr Culpepper also promised most\\nfaithfully, that if the articles were not ready, they would be left on\\nhis hands.  As soon as the tailor had gone, Miss Medea asked me if I\\nwould not like to take another run in the garden.  I knew that she\\nwished to speak to her father, and therefore had a pleasure in\\ndisappointing her.  I therefore replied, that I had been there nearly\\nthe whole day, and did not wish to go out any more.\\n\\n\"Never mind whether you wish it or not; I wish you to go,\" replied Miss\\nMedea, tartly.\\n\\n\"Medea, how can you be so rude?\" cried Mr Culpepper; \"surely Mr Keene\\nmay do as he pleases.  I\\'m surprised at you, Medea.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'m surprised at you, papa, finding out a mystery when there is\\nnone,\" replied Miss Medea, very cross.  \"All you said this morning, and\\nall your surmises, have turned out to be all moonshine.  Yes, you may\\nlook, papa; I tell you--all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Medea, what nonsense you are talking,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s right,\" croaked Mrs Culpepper; \"all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"So you need not be so very particular, papa, I can tell you,\" rejoined\\nMiss Medea, who then whispered in her father\\'s ear, loud enough for me\\nto hear, \"No such thing, nothing but a regular marine.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, nonsense,\" replied the purser, in a low voice; \"the boy has been\\ntaught to say it--he\\'s too clever for you, Medea.\"\\n\\nAt this very true remark of her father\\'s, Miss Medea swelled into a\\ntowering passion, her whole face, neck, and shoulders--for she wore a\\nlow gown in the morning--turning to a fiery scarlet.  I never saw such a\\nfury as she appeared to be.  She rushed by me so roughly, that I was\\nthrown back a couple of paces, and then she bounced out of the room.\\n\\n\"Medea knows how to put that and that together, Mr Culpepper,\" croaked\\nout Mrs Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s wise in her own conceit, and you\\'re a regular old fool,\"\\nrejoined Mr Culpepper, with asperity; \"one too knowing and the other\\nnot half knowing enough.  Master Keene, I hope you are hungry, for we\\nhave a very nice dinner.  Do you like ducks and green peas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, very much,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Were you born at Chatham, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I was born at the Hall, near Southampton.  My mother was\\nbrought up by old Mrs Delmar, the captain\\'s aunt.\"\\n\\nI gave this intelligence on purpose; as I knew it would puzzle Miss\\nMedea, who had just returned from the kitchen.\\n\\nMr Culpepper nodded his head triumphantly to his daughter and wife, who\\nboth appeared dumb-founded at this new light thrown upon the affair.\\n\\nMiss Medea paused a moment and then said to me,--\"I wish to ask you one\\nquestion, Master Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I will not answer any more of your questions, miss,\" replied I; \"You\\nhave been questioning me all the morning, and just now, you were so rude\\nas nearly to push me down.  If you want to know anything more, ask\\nCaptain Delmar; or, if you wish it, I will ask Captain Delmar whether I\\nam to answer you, and if he says I am, I will, but not without.\"\\n\\nThis was a decided blow on my part; mother and Medea both looked\\nfrightened, and Mr Culpepper was more alarmed than either of the\\nfemales.  It proved to them that I knew what they were inquiring for,\\nwhich was to them also proof that I also knew who I was; and further, my\\nreference to Captain Delmar satisfied them that I felt sure of his\\nsupport, and they knew that he would be very much irritated if I told\\nhim on what score they had been pumping me.\\n\\n\"You are very right, Master Keene,\" said Mr Culpepper, turning very\\nred, \"to refuse to answer any questions you don\\'t like; and, Medea, I\\'m\\nsurprised at your behaviour; I insist upon it you do not annoy Master\\nKeene with any more of your impertinent curiosity.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" croaked the old lady; \"hold your tongue, Medea, hold your\\ntongue.\"\\n\\nMiss Medea, who looked as if she could tear my eyes out if she dared,\\nswallowed down her rage as well as she could.  She was mortified at\\nfinding she had made a mistake, annoyed at my answering her so boldly,\\nand frightened at her father\\'s anger; for the old gentleman was very apt\\nto vent it in the _argumentum ad feminam_, and box her ears soundly.\\n\\nFortunately dinner was served just at this moment, and this gave a turn\\nto the conversation, and also to their thoughts.  Mr Culpepper was all\\nattention, and Miss Medea, gradually recovering her temper, also became\\naffable and condescending.\\n\\nThe evening passed away very agreeably; but I went to bed early, as I\\nwished to be left to my own reflections, and it was not till daylight\\nthat I could compose my troubled mind so as to fall asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough the aversion which I had taken to the whole Culpepper family\\nwas so great, that I could have done anything to annoy them, my mind was\\nnow so fully occupied with the information which I had collected\\nrelative to my supposed birth and parentage, that I could not think of\\nmischief.\\n\\nI walked on the common or in the little garden during the whole of the\\nfollowing day, plunged in deep thought, and at night, when I went to\\nbed, I remained awake till the dawn.  During these last two days I had\\nthought and reflected more than I had perhaps done from the hour of my\\nbirth.\\n\\nThat I was better off than I should have been if I had been the son of a\\nprivate in the marines, I felt convinced; but still I had a feeling that\\nI was in a position in which I might be subjected to much insult, and\\nthat, unless I was acknowledged by my aristocratic parent, my connection\\nwith his family would be of no use to me;--and Captain Delmar, how was I\\nto behave to him?  I did not like him much, that was certain, nor did\\nthis new light which had burst forth make me feel any more love for him\\nthan I did before.  Still my mother\\'s words at Chatham rung in my ears,\\n\"Do you know who it is that you have been?\" etcetera.  I felt sure that\\nhe was my father, and I felt a sort of duty towards him; perhaps an\\nincrease of respect.\\n\\nThese were anxious thoughts for a boy not fourteen; and the Culpeppers\\nremarked, that I had not only looked very pale, but had actually grown\\nthin in the face during my short stay.\\n\\nAs I was very quiet and reserved after the first day, they were very\\nglad when my clothes were brought home, and I was reported ready to\\nembark; so was I, for I wanted to go on board and see my friend Tommy\\nDott, with whom I intended, if the subject was brought up, to consult as\\nto my proceedings, or perhaps I thought it would be better to consult\\nBob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain; I was not sure that I should not\\nadvise with them both.\\n\\nI had made up my mind how to behave to my mother.  I knew that she would\\nnever acknowledge the truth, after what had passed between the captain\\nand her when I was present; but I was resolved that I would let her know\\nthat I was in the secret; and I thought that the reply to me would be a\\nguide as to the correctness of the fact, which, with all the hastiness\\nof boyhood, I considered as incontrovertible, although I had not the\\nleast positive proof.\\n\\nThe day that I was to go on board, I requested Miss Culpepper to give me\\na sheet of paper, that I might write to my mother; she supplied me very\\nreadily, saying, \"You had better let me see if you make any mistake in\\nyour spelling before the letter goes; your mamma will be so pleased if\\nyou write your letter properly.\"  She then went down into the kitchen to\\ngive some orders.\\n\\nAs I had not the slightest intention that she should read what I wrote,\\nand resolved to have it in the post before she came up again, I was very\\nconcise in my epistle, which was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"Dear Mother:--I have found it all out--I am the son of Captain\\n  Delmar, and everyone here knows what you have kept a secret from me.\\n  I go on board to-day.\\n\\n  \"Yours truly, P. KEENE.\"\\n\\nThis was very short, and, it must be admitted, direct to the point.  I\\ncould not perhaps have written one which was so calculated to give my\\nmother uneasiness.\\n\\nAs soon as it was finished, I folded it up, and lighted a taper to seal\\nit.  Old Mrs Culpepper, who was in the room, croaked out, \"No, no; you\\nmust show it to Medea.\"  But I paid no attention to her, and having\\nsealed my letter, put on my hat, and walked out to the post-office.  I\\ndropped it into the box, and, on returning, found Mr Culpepper coming\\nhome, accompanied by Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain, and two of the\\nboat\\'s crew.\\n\\nAs I presumed, they were sent for me; I joined them immediately, and was\\nkindly greeted by Bob Cross, who said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, are you all ready for shipping?  We\\'ve come for your\\ntraps.\"\\n\\n\"All ready,\" replied I, \"and very glad to go, for I\\'m tired of staying\\non shore doing nothing.\"\\n\\nWe were soon at the house; the seamen carried away my chest and bedding,\\nwhile Bob Cross remained a little while, that I might pay my farewell to\\nthe ladies.\\n\\nThe ceremony was not attended with much regret on either side.  Miss\\nCulpepper could not help asking me why I did not show her my letter, and\\nI replied, that there were secrets in it, which answer did not at all\\nadd to her good temper; our adieus were, therefore, anything but\\naffectionate, and before the men with my effects were a hundred yards in\\nadvance, Bob Cross and I were at their heels.\\n\\n\"Well, Master Keene,\" said Bob, as we wended our way across South Sea\\nCommon, \"how do you like the purser\\'s ladies?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" replied I; \"they have done nothing but try to pump me the\\nwhole time I have been there; but they did not make much of it.\"\\n\\n\"Women will be curious, Master Keene--pray what did they try to pump\\nabout?\"\\n\\nI hardly knew how to reply, and I hesitated.  I felt a strong\\ninclination towards Bob Cross, and I had before reflected whether I\\nshould make him my confidant; still, I was undecided and made no reply,\\nwhen Bob Cross answered for me:--\\n\\n\"Look ye, child--for although you\\'re going on the quarter-deck, and I am\\nbefore the mast, you are a child compared to me--I can tell you what\\nthey tried to pump about, as well as you can tell me, if you choose.\\nAccording to my thinking, there\\'s no lad on board the frigate that will\\nrequire good advice as you will; and I tell you candidly, you will have\\nyour cards to play.  Bob Cross is no fool, and can see as far through a\\nfog as most chaps; I like you for yourself as far as I see of you, and I\\nhave not forgotten your mother\\'s kindness to me, when she had her own\\nmisery to occupy her thoughts; not that I wanted the money--it wasn\\'t\\nthe money, but the way and the circumstances under which it was given.\\nI told you I\\'d look after you a bit--a bit means a great deal with me--\\nand so I will, if you choose that I shall; if not, I shall touch my hat\\nto you, as my officer, which won\\'t help you very much.  So, now you have\\nto settle, my lad, whether you will have me as your friend, or not.\"\\n\\nThe appeal quite decided me.  \"Bob Cross,\" replied I.  \"I do wish to\\nmake you my friend; I thought of it before, but I did not know whether\\nto go to you or to Tommy Dott.\"\\n\\n\"Tommy Dott!  Well, Master Keene, that\\'s not very flattering, to put me\\nin one scale, and Tommy Dott in the other; I\\'m not surprised at its\\nweighing down in my favour.  If you wish to get into mischief you can\\'t\\napply to a better hand than Tommy Dott; but Tommy Dott is not half so\\nfit to advise you, as you are, I expect, to advise him; so make him your\\nplaymate and companion, if you please, but as to his advice, it\\'s not\\nworth asking.  However, as you have given me the preference, I will now\\ntell you that the Culpepper people have been trying to find out who is\\nyour father.  Ain\\'t I right?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, this is no time to talk about such things; we shall be down\\nto the boat in another minute, so we\\'ll say no more at present; only\\nrecollect, when you are on board, if they talk about appointing a man to\\ntake charge of your hammock, say that Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain,\\nis, you understand, to be the person; say that and no more.  I will tell\\nyou why by-and-by, when we have time to talk together and if any of your\\nmessmates say anything to you on the same point which the Culpeppers\\nhave been working at, make no reply and hold yourself very stiff.  Now,\\nhere we are at the sally port, so there\\'s an end to our palaver for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nMy chest and bedding were already in the boat, and as soon as Cross and\\nI had stepped in he ordered the bowman to shove off; in half an hour we\\narrived alongside the frigate, which lay at Spithead, bright with new\\npaint, and with her pennant proudly flying to the breeze.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better follow me, sir, and mind you touch your hat when the\\nofficers speak to you,\" said Bob Cross, ascending the accommodation\\nladder.  I did so, and found myself on the quarter deck, in the presence\\nof the first lieutenant and several of the officers.\\n\\n\"Well, Cross,\" said the first lieutenant.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve brought a young gentleman on board to join the ship.  Captain\\nDelmar has, I believe, given his orders about him.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I presume?\" said the first lieutenant, eyeing me from head\\nto foot.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, touching my hat.\\n\\n\"How long have you been at Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Three days, sir; I have been staying at Mr Culpepper\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Well, did you fall in love with Miss Culpepper?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I hate her.\"\\n\\nAt this answer the first lieutenant and the officers near him burst out\\na-laughing.\\n\\n\"Well, youngster, you must dine with us in the gun-room to-day; and\\nwhere\\'s Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"Here, sir,\" said Tommy Dott, coming from the other side of the\\nquarter-deck.\\n\\n\"Mr Dott, take this young gentleman down below, and show him the\\nmidshipmen\\'s berth.  Let me see, who is to take care of his hammock?\"\\n\\n\"I believe that Bob Cross is to take care of it, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"The captain\\'s coxswain--humph.  Well, that\\'s settled at all events;\\nvery good--we shall have the pleasure of your company to dinner, Mr\\nKeene.  Why, Mr Dott and you look as if you knew each other.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t we, Tommy?\" said I to the midshipman, grinning.\\n\\n\"I suspect that there is a pair of you,\" said the first lieutenant,\\nturning aft and walking away; after which Tommy and I went down the\\ncompanion ladder as fast as we could, and in a few seconds afterwards\\nwere sitting together on the same chest, in most intimate conversation.\\n\\nMy extreme resemblance to our honourable captain was not unobserved by\\nthe officers who were on the quarter-deck at the time of my making my\\nappearance; and, as I afterwards heard from Bob Cross, he was sent for\\nby the surgeon, on some pretence or another, to obtain any information\\nrelative to me.  What were Bob Cross\\'s reasons for answering as he did I\\ncould not at that time comprehend, but he explained them to me\\nafterwards.\\n\\n\"Who brought him down, Cross?\" said the surgeon, carelessly.\\n\\n\"His own mother, sir; he has no father, sir, I hear.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her?  What sort of a person was she?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Bob Cross, \"I\\'ve seen many ladies of quality, but\\nsuch a real lady I don\\'t think I ever set my eyes upon before; and such\\na beauty--I\\'d marry to-morrow if I could take in tow a craft like her.\"\\n\\n\"How did they come down to Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, she came down to Portsmouth in a coach and four; but she\\nwalked to the George Hotel, as if she was nobody.\"\\n\\nThis was not a fib on the part of the coxswain, for we came down by the\\nPortsmouth coach; it did, however, deceive the surgeon, as was intended.\\n\\n\"Did you see anything of her, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"Not when she was with the captain, sir, but at her own lodgings I did;\\nsuch a generous lady I never met with.\"\\n\\nA few more questions were put, all of which were replied to in much the\\nsame strain by the coxswain, so as to make out my mother to be a very\\nimportant and mysterious personage.  It is true that Tommy Dott could\\nhave contradicted all this; but, in the first place, it was not very\\nlikely that there would be any communication upon the point between him\\nand the officers; and in the next I cautioned him to say nothing about\\nwhat he knew, which, as he was strongly attached to me, he strictly\\ncomplied with: so Bob Cross completely mystified the surgeon, who, of\\ncourse, made his report to his messmates.\\n\\nMr Culpepper\\'s report certainly differed somewhat from that of Bob\\nCross.  There was my statement of my aunt being married to a marine\\nofficer--but it was my statement; there was also my statement of my\\nmother residing with Captain Delmar\\'s aunt; altogether there was doubt\\nand mystery; and it ended in my mother being supposed to be a much\\ngreater person than she really was--everything tending to prove her a\\nlady of rank being willingly received, and all counter-statements looked\\nupon as apocryphal and false.\\n\\nBut whoever my mother might be, on one point every one agreed, which\\nwas, that I was the son of the Honourable Captain Delmar, and on this\\npoint I was equally convinced myself.  I waited with some anxiety for my\\nmother\\'s reply to my letter, which arrived two days after I had joined\\nthe frigate.  It was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"My dear Percival:--\\n\\n  \"You little know the pain and astonishment which I felt upon receipt\\n  of your very unkind and insulting letter; surely you could not have\\n  reflected at the time you wrote it, but must have penned it in a\\n  moment of irritation arising from some ungenerous remark which has\\n  been made in your hearing.\\n\\n  \"Alas, my dear child, you will find, now that you have commenced your\\n  career in life, that there are too many whose only pleasure is to\\n  inflict pain upon their fellow-creatures.  I only can imagine that\\n  some remark has been made in your presence, arising from there being a\\n  similarity of features between you and the Honourable Captain Delmar;\\n  that there is so has been before observed by others.  Indeed your\\n  uncle and aunt Bridgeman were both struck with the resemblance, when\\n  Captain Delmar arrived at Chatham; but this proves nothing, my dear\\n  child--people are very often alike, who have never seen each other, or\\n  heard each other mentioned, till they have by accident been thrown\\n  together so as to be compared.\\n\\n  \"It may certainly be, as your father was in the service of Captain\\n  Delmar, and constantly attended upon him, and indeed I may add as I\\n  was occasionally seeing him, that the impression of his countenance\\n  might be constantly in our memory, and--but you don\\'t understand such\\n  questions, and therefore I will say no more, except that you will\\n  immediately dismiss from your thoughts any such idea.\\n\\n  \"You forget, my dearest boy, that you are insulting me by supposing\\n  any such thing, and that your mother\\'s honour is called in question; I\\n  am sure you never thought of that when you wrote those hasty and\\n  inconsiderate lines.  I must add, my dear boy, that knowing Captain\\n  Delmar, and how proud and sensitive he is, if it should ever come to\\n  his knowledge that you had suspected or asserted what you have, his\\n  favour and protection would be lost to you for ever: at present he is\\n  doing a kind and charitable action in bringing forward the son of a\\n  faithful servant; but if he imagined for a moment that you were\\n  considered related to him he would cast you off for ever, and all your\\n  prospects in life would be ruined.\\n\\n  \"Even allowing it possible that you were what you so madly stated\\n  yourself in your letter to be, I am convinced he would do so.  If such\\n  a report came to his ears, he would immediately disavow you, and leave\\n  you to find your own way in the world.\\n\\n  \"You see, therefore, my dear boy, how injurious to you in every way\\n  such a ridiculous surmise must prove, and I trust that, not only for\\n  your own sake, but for your mother\\'s character, you will, so far from\\n  giving credence, indignantly disavow what must be a source of mischief\\n  and annoyance to all parties.\\n\\n  \"Captain Bridgeman desires me to say, that he is of my opinion, so is\\n  your aunt Milly: as for your grandmother, of course, I dare not show\\n  her your letter.  Write to me, my dear boy, and tell me how this\\n  unfortunate mistake happened, and believe me to be your affectionate\\n  mother, ARABELLA KEENE.\"\\n\\nI read this letter over ten times before I came to any conclusion; at\\nlast I said to myself, there is not in any one part of it any positive\\ndenial of the fact, and resolved some future day, when I had had some\\nconversation with Bob Cross, to show it to him, and ask his opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, at daylight, the blue Peter was hoisted at the\\nforemast, and the gun fired as a signal for sailing; all was bustle--\\nhoisting in, clearing boats of stock, and clearing the ship of women and\\nstrangers.\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock Captain Delmar made his appearance, the hands were piped\\nup anchor, and in half an hour we were standing out for St. Helen\\'s.\\nBefore night it blew very fresh, and we went rolling down the Channel\\nbefore an easterly wind.  I went to my hammock very sick, and did not\\nrecover for several days, during which nobody asked for me, or any\\nquestions about me, except Bob Cross and Tommy Dott.\\n\\nAs soon as I was well enough, I made my appearance on deck, and was\\nordered by the first lieutenant to do my duty under the signal\\nmidshipman: this was day duty, and not very irksome; I learnt the flags,\\nand how to use a spy-glass.\\n\\nWe were charged with despatches for the fleet, then off Cadiz, and on\\nthe tenth day we fell in with it, remained a week in company, and then\\nwere ordered to Gibraltar and Malta.  From Malta we went home again with\\ndespatches, having been out three months.\\n\\nDuring this short and pleasant run, I certainly did not learn much of my\\nprofession, but I did learn a little of the ways of the world.  First,\\nas to Captain Delmar, his conduct to me was anything but satisfactory;\\nhe never inquired for me during the time that I was unwell, and took no\\nnotice of me on my reappearance.\\n\\nThe officers and young gentlemen, as midshipmen are called, were asked\\nto dine in the cabin in rotation, and I did in consequence dine two or\\nthree times in the cabin; but it appeared to me, as if the captain\\npurposely took no notice of me, although he generally did say a word or\\ntwo to the others; moreover as the signal mids were up in the morning\\nwatch, he would occasionally send to invite one of the others to\\nbreakfast with him, but he never paid me that compliment.\\n\\nThis annoyed me, and I spoke of it to Bob Cross, with whom I had had\\nsome long conversations.  I had told him all I knew relative to myself,\\nwhat my suspicions were, and I had shown him my mother\\'s reply.  His\\nopinion on the subject may be given in what follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Master Keene, you are in an awkward position; the captain is a\\nvery proud man, and too proud to acknowledge that you are any way\\nrelated to him.  It\\'s my opinion, from what you have told me, and from\\nother reasons, particularly from your likeness to the captain, that your\\nsuspicions are correct; but, what then?  Your mother is sworn to\\nsecrecy--that\\'s clear; and the captain won\\'t own you--that\\'s also very\\nclear.  I had some talk with the captain\\'s steward on the subject when I\\nwas taking a glass of grog with him the other night in this berth.  It\\nwas he that brought up the subject, not me, and he said, that the\\ncaptain not asking you to breakfast, and avoiding you, as it were, was\\nanother proof that you belonged to him; and the wishing to hide the\\nsecret only makes him behave as he does.  You have a difficult game to\\nplay, Master Keene; but you are a clever lad, and you ask advice--mind\\nyou follow it, or it\\'s little use asking it.  You must always be very\\nrespectful to Captain Delmar, and keep yourself at as great a distance\\nfrom him as he does from you.\"\\n\\n\"That I\\'m sure I will,\" replied I, \"for I dislike him very much.\"\\n\\n\"No, you must not do that, but you must bend to circumstances; by-and-by\\nthings will go on better; but mind you keep on good terms with the\\nofficers, and never be saucy, or they may say to you what may not be\\npleasant; recollect this, and things will go on better, as I said\\nbefore.  If Captain Delmar protects you with his interest, you will be a\\ncaptain over the heads of many who are now your superiors on board of\\nthis frigate.  One thing be careful of, which is, to keep your own\\ncounsel, and don\\'t be persuaded in a moment of confidence to trust\\nanything to Tommy Dott, or any other midshipman; and if any one hints at\\nwhat you suppose, deny it immediately; nay, if necessary, fight for it--\\nthat will be the way to please the captain, for you will be of his side\\nthen, and not against him.\"\\n\\nThat this advice of Bob Cross was the best that could be given to one in\\nmy position there could not be a doubt; and that I did resolve to follow\\nit, is most certain.  I generally passed away a portion of my leisure\\nhours in Bob\\'s company, and became warmly attached to him; and certainly\\nmy time was not thrown away, for I learnt a great deal from him.\\n\\nOne evening, as I was leaning against one of the guns on the main deck,\\nwaiting for Cross to come out of the cabin, I was amused with the\\nfollowing conversation between a boatswain\\'s mate and a fore-top man.  I\\nshall give it verbatim.  They were talking of one that was dead; and\\nafter the boatswain\\'s mate had said--\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s in heaven, poor fellow.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause, the fore-top man said--\\n\\n\"I wonder, Bill, whether I shall ever go to heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" replied the boatswain\\'s mate.\\n\\n\"Why, the parson says it\\'s good works; now, I certainly have been a\\npretty many times in action, and I have killed plenty of Frenchmen in my\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s sufficient, I should think; I hold my hopes upon just the\\nsame claims.  I\\'ve cut down fifty Frenchmen in my life, and if that\\nain\\'t good works, I don\\'t know what is.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose Nelson\\'s in heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Of course; if so be he wishes to be there, I should like to know who\\nwould keep him out, if he was determined on it; no, no; depend upon it\\nhe walked _slap_ in.\"\\n\\nOn our return to Portsmouth, the captain went up to the Admiralty with\\nthe despatches, the frigate remaining at Spithead, ready to sail at a\\nmoment\\'s notice.\\n\\nI was now quite accustomed to the ship and officers; the conviction I\\nhad of my peculiar position, together with the advice of Bob Cross, had\\nvery much subdued my spirit; perhaps the respect created by discipline,\\nand the example of others, which produced in me a degree of awe of the\\ncaptain and the lieutenants, assisted a little--certain it is, that I\\ngained the goodwill of my messmates, and had not been in any scrape\\nduring the whole cruise.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant was a stern, but not unkind man; he would blow you\\nup, as we termed it, when he scolded for half an hour without ceasing.\\nI never knew a man with such a flow of words; but if permitted to go on\\nwithout interruption, he was content, without proceeding to further\\npunishment.  Any want of respect, however, was peculiarly offensive to\\nhim, and any attempt to excuse yourself was immediately cut short with,\\n\"No reply, sir.\"\\n\\nThe second day after our return to Spithead, I was sent on shore in the\\ncutter to bring off a youngster who was to join the ship; he had never\\nbeen to sea before; his name was Green, and he was as green as a\\ngooseberry.  I took a dislike to him the moment that I saw him, because\\nhe had a hooked nose and very small ferrety eyes.  As we were pulling on\\nboard he asked me a great many questions of all kinds, particularly\\nabout the captain and officers, and to amuse myself and the boat\\'s crew,\\nwho were on the full titter, I exercised my peculiar genius for\\ninvention.\\n\\nAt last, after I had given a character of the first lieutenant, which\\nmade him appear a sort of marine ogre, he asked how it was I got on with\\nhim:--\\n\\n\"O, very well,\" replied I; \"but I\\'m a freemason, and so is he, and he\\'s\\nnever severe with a brother mason.\"\\n\\n\"But how did he know you were a mason?\"\\n\\n\"I made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me,\\nand he left off almost immediately; that is, when I made the second\\nsign; he did not when I made the first.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to know these signs.  Won\\'t you tell them to me?\"\\n\\n\"Tell them to you! oh no, that won\\'t do,\" replied I.  \"I don\\'t know you.\\nHere we are on board--in bow,--rowed of all, men.  Now, Mr Green, I\\'ll\\nshow you the way up.\"\\n\\nMr Green was presented, and ushered into the service much in the same\\nway as I was; but he had not forgotten what I said to him relative to\\nthe first lieutenant; and it so happened that, on the third day he\\nwitnessed a jobation, delivered by the first lieutenant to one of the\\nmidshipmen, who, venturing to reply, was ordered to the mast-head for\\nthe remainder of the day; added to which, a few minutes afterwards, the\\nfirst lieutenant ordered two men to be put both legs in irons.  Mr\\nGreen trembled as he saw the men led away by the master-at-arms, and he\\ncame to me:\\n\\n\"I do wish, Keene, you would tell me those signs,\" said he; \"can\\'t you\\nbe persuaded to part with them?  I\\'ll give you any thing that I have\\nwhich you may like.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I should like to have that long spy-glass of yours, for\\nit\\'s a very good one; and, as signal-midshipman, will be useful to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will give it you with all my heart,\" replied he, \"if you will tell me\\nthe signs.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, come down below, give me the glass, and I will tell them to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nMr Green and I went down to the berth, and I received the spy-glass as\\na present in due form.  I then led him to my chest in the steerage, and\\nin a low, confidential tone, told him as follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Green, you must be very particular about making those signs,\\nfor if you make a mistake, you will be worse off than if you never made\\nthem at all, for the first lieutenant will suppose that you are trying\\nto persuade him that you are a mason, when you are not.  Now, observe,\\nyou must not attempt to make the first sign until he has scolded you\\nwell; then, at any pause, you must make it; thus, you see, you must put\\nyour thumb to the tip of your nose, and extend your hand straight out\\nfrom it, with all the fingers separated, as wide as you can.  Now, do it\\nas I did it.  Stop--wait a little, till that marine passes.  Yes, that\\nis it.  Well, that is considered the first proof of your being a mason,\\nbut it requires a second.  The first lieutenant will, I tell you\\nfrankly, be or rather pretend to be, in a terrible rage, and will\\ncontinue to rail at you; you must, therefore, wait a little till he\\npauses; and then, you observe, put up your thumb to your nose, with the\\nfingers of your hands spread out as before, and then add to it your\\nother hand, by joining your other thumb to the little finger of the hand\\nalready up, and stretch your other hand and fingers out like the first.\\nThen you will see the effects of the second sign.  Do you think you can\\nrecollect all this? for, as I said before, you must make no mistake.\"\\n\\nGreen put his hands up as I told him, and after three or four essays\\ndeclared himself perfect, and I left him.\\n\\nIt was about three days afterwards that Mr Green upset a kid of dirty\\nwater upon the lower deck which had been dry holystoned, and the mate of\\nthe lower deck, when the first lieutenant went his round, reported the\\ncircumstance to exculpate himself.  Mr Green was consequently summoned\\non the quarter-deck; and the first lieutenant, who was very angry,\\ncommenced, as usual, a volley of abuse on the unfortunate youngster.\\n\\nGreen, recollecting my instructions, waited till the first lieutenant\\nhad paused, and then made the first freemason sign, looking up very\\nboldly at the first lieutenant, who actually drew back with astonishment\\nat this contemptuous conduct, hitherto unwitnessed on board of a\\nman-at-war.\\n\\n\"What! sir,\" cried the first lieutenant.  \"Why, sir, are you mad?--you,\\njust come into the service, treating me in this manner!  I can tell you,\\nsir, that you will not be three days longer in the service--no, sir, not\\nthree days; for either you leave the service or I do.  Of all the\\nimpudence, of all the insolence, of all the contempt I have heard of,\\nthis beats all--and from such a little animal as you.  Consider yourself\\nas under an arrest, sir, till the captain comes on board, and your\\nconduct is reported; go down below, sir, immediately.\"\\n\\nThe lieutenant paused, and now Green gave him sign the second, as a\\nreply, thinking that they would then come to a right understanding--but\\nto his astonishment, the first lieutenant was more curious than ever;\\nand calling the sergeant of marines, ordered him to take Mr Green down,\\nand put him in irons, under the half-deck.\\n\\nPoor Green was handed down, all astonishment, at the want of success of\\nhis mason\\'s signs.  I, who stood abaft, was delighted at the success of\\nmy joke, while the first lieutenant walked hastily up and down the deck,\\nas much astonished as enraged at such insulting and insolent conduct\\nfrom a lad who had not been a week in the service.\\n\\nAfter a time the first lieutenant went down below, when Bob Cross, who\\nwas on deck, and who had perceived my delight at the scene, which was to\\nhim and all others so inexplicable, came up to me and said:--\\n\\n\"Master Keene, I\\'m sure, by your looks, you knew something about this.\\nThat foolish lad never had dared do so, if he knew what it was he had\\ndone.  Now, don\\'t look so demure, but tell me how it is.\"\\n\\nI walked aft with Bob Cross, and confided my secret to him; he laughed\\nheartily, and said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Tommy Dott did say that you were up to any thing, and so I think\\nyou are; but you see this is a very serious affair for poor Green, and,\\nlike the fable of the frogs, what is sport to you is death to others.\\nThe poor lad will be turned out of the service, and lose his chance of\\nbeing a post captain; so you must allow me to explain the matter so that\\nit gets to the ears of the first lieutenant as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied I, \"do as you like, Bob; if any one\\'s to be turned out\\nof the service for such nonsense, it ought to be me, and not Green, poor\\nsnob.\"\\n\\n\"No fear of your being turned out; the first lieutenant won\\'t like you\\nthe worse, and the other officers will like you better especially as I\\nshall say that it is by your wish that I explain all to get Mr Green\\nout of the scrape.  I\\'ll go to the surgeon and tell him--but, Master\\nKeene, don\\'t you call such matters _nonsense_, or you\\'ll find yourself\\nmistaken one of these days.  I never saw such disrespect on a\\nquarter-deck in all my life--worse than mutiny a thousand times.\"  Here\\nBob Cross burst out into a fit of laughter, as he recalled Green\\'s\\nextended fingers to his memory, and then he turned away and went down\\nbelow to speak to the surgeon.\\n\\nAs soon as Cross had quitted the deck, I could not restrain my curiosity\\nas to the situation of my friend Green; I therefore went down the ladder\\nto the half-deck, and there, on the starboard side between the guns, I\\nperceived the poor fellow, with his legs in irons, his hands firmly\\nclasped together, looking so woeful and woe-begone, every now and then\\nraising his eyes up to the beam of the upper deck, as if he would appeal\\nto heaven, that I scarcely could refrain from laughing.  I went up to\\nhim and said:--\\n\\n\"Why, Green, how is all this?--what has happened?\"\\n\\n\"Happened?\" said the poor fellow; \"happened? see what has happened; here\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"Did you make the freemason\\'s signs?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I?  Yes--I did: Oh, what will become of me?\"\\n\\n\"You could not have made them right; you must have forgotten them.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I made them as you told me; I\\'m quite sure of that.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps I did not recollect them exactly myself: however, be of\\ngood heart; I will have the whole matter explained to the first\\nlieutenant.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do; only get me out of this.  I don\\'t want the glass back.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have it done directly,\" replied I.\\n\\nAs I went away, Bob Cross came up, and said I was wanted by the first\\nlieutenant in the gun-room.  \"Don\\'t be afraid,\" said he: \"they\\'ve been\\nlaughing at it already, and the first lieutenant is it a capital humour;\\nstill he\\'ll serve you out well; you must expect that.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I make him the sign, Cross?\" replied I, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no; you\\'ve gone far enough, and too far already; mind what I say to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nI went down into the gun-room, when a tittering ceased as the sentry\\nopened the door, and I walked in.\\n\\n\"Did you want me, sir?\" said I to the first lieutenant, touching my hat,\\nand looking very demure.\\n\\n\"So, Mr Keene, I understand it was you who have been practising upon\\nMr Green, and teaching him insult and disrespect to his superior\\nofficers on the quarter-deck.  Well, sir?\"\\n\\nI made no reply, but appeared very penitent.\\n\\n\"Because a boy has just come to sea, and is ignorant of his profession,\\nit appears to be a custom--which I shall take care shall not be followed\\nup--to play him all manner of tricks, and tell him all manner of\\nfalsehoods.  Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Green and I have both just come to sea, sir, and the midshipmen all\\nplay us so many tricks,\" replied I, humbly, \"that I hardly know whether\\nwhat I do is right or wrong.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir, it was you who played this trick to Mr Green.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I told him so for fun, but I didn\\'t think he was such a fool\\nas to believe me.  I only said that you were a freemason, and that\\nfreemasons were kind to each other, and that you gave one another signs\\nto know one another by; I heard you say you were a freemason, sir, when\\nI dined in the gun-room.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I did say so; but that is no reason for your teaching him to\\nbe impudent.\"\\n\\n\"He asked me for the signs, sir, and I didn\\'t know them exactly; so I\\ngave him the signs that Mr Dott and I always make between us.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Dott and you--a pretty pair, as I said before.  I\\'ve a great mind\\nto put you in Mr Green\\'s place--at all events, I shall report your\\nconduct when the captain comes from London.  There, sir, you may go.\"\\n\\nI put on a penitent face as I went out wiping my eyes with the back of\\nmy hands.  After I went out, I waited a few seconds at the gun-room\\ndoor, and then the officers, supposing that I was out of hearing, gave\\nvent to their mirth, the first lieutenant laughing the loudest.\\n\\n\"Cross is right,\" thought I, as I went up the ladder; a minute\\nafterwards, Mr Green was set free, and, after a severe reprimand, was\\nallowed to return to his duty.\\n\\n\"You are well out of that trick, my hearty,\" said Bob Cross; \"the first\\nlieutenant won\\'t say a word to the captain, never fear; but don\\'t try it\\nagain.\"\\n\\nBut an event occurred a few hours afterwards which might have been\\nattended with more serious consequences.  The ship was, during the day,\\nsurrounded by shore boats of all descriptions, containing Jews, sailors\\'\\nwives, and many other parties, who wished to have admittance on board.\\nIt was almost dusk, the tide was running strong flood, and the wind was\\nvery fresh, so that there was a good deal of sea.  All the boats had\\nbeen ordered to keep off by the first lieutenant, but they still\\nlingered, in hope of getting on board.\\n\\nI was looking over the stern, and perceived that the boat belonging to\\nthe bumboat woman, who was on board of the ship, was lying with her\\npainter fast to the stern ladder; the waterman was in her, as well as\\none of the sailors\\' wives, who had left her own wherry in hopes of\\ngetting on board when the waterman went alongside to take in the\\narticles not sold, when the bumboat woman left the ship, which would be\\nin a few minutes, as it was nearly gun-fire for sunset.  The waterman,\\nwho thought it time to haul alongside, and wished to communicate with\\nhis employer on board, was climbing up by the stern ladder.\\n\\n\"That\\'s against orders, you know,\" cried I to the man.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; but it is so rough, that the boat would be swamped if it were\\nto remain alongside long, and I hope you won\\'t order me down again;\\nthere\\'s some nice cakes in the boat, sir, just under the stern sheets,\\nif you would like to have them, and think it worth while to go down for\\nthem.\"\\n\\nThis was a bribe, and I replied, \"No, I don\\'t want your cakes, but you\\nmay come up.\"\\n\\nThe man thanked me, and walked forward as soon as he had gained the\\ndeck.  On second thoughts, I determined that I would have the cakes; so\\nI descended by the stern ladder, and desiring the woman who was left in\\nthe boat to haul upon the rope, contrived to get into the boat.\\n\\n\"What is it you want, my dear?\" said the woman.\\n\\n\"I come for some of those cakes under the stern sheets,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll soon rummage them out,\" said she, \"and I hope you will let\\nme slip on board when the boat is alongside.  Mind, sir, how you step,\\nyou\\'ll smash all the pipes.  Give me your hand.  I\\'m an old sailor.\"\\n\\n\"I should not think so,\" replied I, looking at her.  I could hardly make\\nout her face, but her form was small, and, if an old sailor, she\\ncertainly was a very young woman.\\n\\nWe had a good many articles to remove before we could get at the cakes,\\nwhich were under the stern sheets; and the boat rocked and tossed so\\nviolently with the sea which was running, that we were both on our knees\\nfor some little while before we obtained the basket: when we did, to our\\nsurprise, we found that the boat\\'s painter, somehow or another, had\\nloosened, and that during our search we had drifted nearly one hundred\\nyards from the ship.\\n\\n\"Mercy on me!--why, we are adrift,\" exclaimed the woman.  \"What shall we\\ndo?  It\\'s no use hailing, they\\'ll never hear us; look well round for any\\nboat you may see.\"\\n\\n\"It is getting so dark that we shall not see far,\" replied I, not much\\nliking our position.  \"Where shall we go to?\"\\n\\n\"Go to!--clean out to St. Helen\\'s, if the boat does not fill before we\\nget there; and further than that too, if I mistake not, with this gale\\nof wind.  We may as well say our prayers, youngster, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we make sail upon her?\" replied I.  \"Can\\'t we try and pull on\\nshore somewhere?  Had we not better do that, and say our prayers\\nafterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Well said, my little bantam,\" replied the woman: \"you would have made a\\ngood officer if you had been spared; but the fact is, boy, that we can\\ndo nothing with the oars in this heavy sea; and as for the sail, how can\\nyou and I step the mast, rolling and tossing about in this way?  If the\\nmast were stepped, and the sail set, I think I could manage to steer, if\\nthe weather was smoother, but not in this bubble and this gale; it\\nrequires older hands than either you or I.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, we must sit still and trust to our luck, bale out the boat, and\\nkeep her from swamping as long as we can, and between times we may cry,\\nor we may pray, or we may eat the cakes and red herrings, or the soft\\nbread and other articles in the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s bale the boat out first,\" said I, \"for she\\'s half full of water;\\nthen we\\'ll have something to eat, for I feel hungry and cold already,\\nand then we may as well say our prayers.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I tell you what, we\\'ll have something to drink, too, for I\\nhave a drop for Jem, if I could have got on board.  I promised it to\\nhim, poor fellow, but it\\'s no use keeping it now, for I expect we\\'ll\\nboth be in Davy\\'s locker before morning.\"\\n\\nThe woman took out from where it was secreted in her dress, a bladder\\ncontaining spirits; she opened the mouth of it, and poured out a portion\\ninto one of the milk-cans; having drunk herself, she handed it to me,\\nbut not feeling inclined, and being averse to spirits, I rejected it,\\n\"Not just now,\" said I, \"by-and-by perhaps.\"\\n\\nDuring the time of this conversation we were swept by a strong tide and\\nstrong wind right out of the anchorage at Spithead; the sea was very\\nhigh, and dashed into the boat, so that I was continually baling to keep\\nit free; the night was as dark as pitch; we could see nothing except the\\nlights of the vessels which we had left far away from us, and they were\\nnow but as little twinkles as we rose upon the waves.  The wind roared,\\nand there was every appearance of a heavy gale.\\n\\n\"Little hopes of our weathering this storm,\" said the woman; \"we shall\\nsoon be swamped if we do not put her before the wind.  I\\'ll see if I\\ncannot find the lines.\"\\n\\nShe did so after a time, and by means of a rudder put the boat before\\nthe wind; the boat then took in much less water, but ran at a swift rate\\nthrough the heavy sea.\\n\\n\"There, we shall do better now; out to sea we go, that\\'s clear,\" said\\nthe woman; \"and before daylight we shall be in the Channel, if we do not\\nfill and go down; and then, the Lord have mercy upon us, that\\'s all!\\nWon\\'t you take a drop?\" continued she, pouring out some spirits into the\\ncan.\\n\\nAs I felt very cold, I did not this time refuse.  I drank a small\\nquantity of the spirits; the woman took off the remainder, which, with\\nwhat she had previously drunk, began to have an effect upon her.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my little Trojan,\" said she, and she commenced singing.\\n\"A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether; in spite of wind and\\nweather, boys, in spite of wind and weather.  Poor Jem,\" continued she,\\n\"he\\'ll be disappointed; he made sure of being glorious to-night, and I\\nmade sure to sleep by his side--now he\\'ll be quite sober--and I\\'ll be\\nfood for fishes; it\\'s a cold bed that I shall turn into before morning,\\nthat\\'s certain.  Hand me the cakes, boy, if you can fumble them out; the\\nmore we fill ourselves, the less room for salt water.  Well, then, wind\\nand waves are great bullies; they fly slap back in a fright when they\\nbang against a great ship; but when they get hold of a little boat like\\nthis, how they leap and topple in, as if they made sure of us [here a\\nwave dashed into the boat].  Yes, that\\'s your sort.  Come along, swamp a\\nlittle boat you washy cowards, it\\'s only a woman and a boy.  Poor Jim,\\nhe\\'ll miss me something, but he\\'ll miss the liquor more; who cares?\\nLet\\'s have another drop.\"\\n\\n\"Give me the lines, then,\" said I, as I perceived she was letting them\\ngo, \"or we shall be broadside to the waves again.\"\\n\\nI took the rudder lines from her, and steered the boat, while she again\\nresorted to the bladder of spirits.\\n\\n\"Take another sip,\" said she, after she had filled the milk-can; \"it\\nwon\\'t harm you.\"\\n\\nI thought the same, for I was wet through, and the wind, as it howled,\\npierced me to the bones; I took a small quantity as before, and then\\ncontinued to keep the boat before the wind.  The sea was increasing very\\nmuch and although no sailor, I felt fully convinced that the boat could\\nnot live much longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime the woman was becoming intoxicated very fast.  I knew\\nthe consequence of this, and requested her to bale out the boat: she did\\nso, and sang a mournful sort of song as she baled, but the howling of\\nthe wind prevented me from distinguishing the words.\\n\\nI cannot well analyse my feelings at this time--they were confused; but\\nthis I know, self-preservation and hope were the most predominant.  I\\nthought of my mother, of my aunt, of Captain Bridgeman, Captain Delmar,\\nand Bob Cross; but my thoughts were as rapid as the gale which bore us\\nalong, and I was too much employed in steering the boat, and preventing\\nthe seas from filling it, to have a moment to collect my ideas.\\n\\nAgain the woman applied to the bladder of spirits, and offered some to\\nme; I refused.  I had had enough, and by this time she had had too much,\\nand after an attempt to bale she dropped down in the stern sheets,\\nsmashing pipes and everything beneath her, and spoke no more.\\n\\nWe had now been more than four hours adrift; the wind was as strong as\\never, and, I thought, the sea much higher; but I kept the boat steady\\nbefore the wind, and by degrees, as I became more accustomed to steer,\\nshe did not take in so much water; still the boat appeared to be sinking\\ndeeper down, and after a time I considered it necessary to bale her out.\\nI did so with my hat, for I found it was half full of water; and then I\\nexecrated the woman for having intoxicated herself, so as to be useless\\nin such an emergency.\\n\\nI succeeded in clearing the boat of the major portion of the water,\\nwhich was no easy task, as the boat, having remained broadside to the\\nwind, had taken in the sea continually as I baled it out.  I then once\\nmore resumed the helm, and put the boat before the wind, and thus did I\\ncontinue for two hours more, when the rain came down in torrents, and\\nthe storm was wilder than ever, but a Portsmouth wherry is one of the\\nbest boats ever built, and so it proved in this instance.  Still I was\\nnow in a situation most trying for a lad between fourteen and fifteen;\\nmy teeth chattered with the cold, and I was drenched through and\\nthrough; the darkness was opaque, and I could see nothing but the white\\nfoam of the waves, which curled and broke close to the gunwale of the\\nboat.\\n\\nAt one moment I despaired, and looked for immediate death; but my\\nbuoyant spirit raised me up again, and I hoped.  It would be daylight in\\na few hours, and oh! how I looked and longed for daylight.  I knew I\\nmust keep the boat before the wind; I did so, but the seas were worse\\nthan ever; they now continually broke into the boat, for the tide had\\nturned, which had increased the swell.\\n\\nAgain I left the helm and bailed out; I was cold and faint, and I felt\\nrecovered with the exertion; I also tried to rouse the woman, but it was\\nuseless.  I felt for her bladder of liquor, and found it in her bosom,\\nmore than half empty.  I drank more freely, and my spirits and my\\ncourage revived.  After that, I ate, and steered the boat, awaiting the\\ncoming daylight.\\n\\nIt came at last slowly--so slowly; but it did come, and I felt almost\\nhappy.  There is such a horror in darkness when added to danger; I felt\\nas if I could have worshipped the sun as it rose slowly, and with a\\nwatery appearance, above the horizon.  I looked around me: there was\\nsomething like land astern of us, such as I had seen pointed out as land\\nby Bob Cross, when off the coast of Portugal; and so it was--it was the\\nIsle of Wight: for the wind had changed when the rain came down, and I\\nhad altered the course of the boat so that for the last four hours I had\\nbeen steering for the coast of France.\\n\\nBut, although I was cold and shivering, and worn out with watching, and\\ntired with holding the lines by which the wherry was steered, I felt\\nalmost happy at the return of day.  I looked down upon my companion in\\nthe boat; she lay sound asleep, with her head upon the basket of tobacco\\npipes, her bonnet wet and dripping, with its faded ribbons hanging in\\nthe water which washed to and fro at the bottom of the boat, as it\\nrolled and rocked to the motion of the waves; her hair had fallen over\\nher face, so as almost to conceal her features; I thought that she had\\ndied during the night, so silent and so breathless did she lie.  The\\nwaves were not so rough now as they had been, for the flood tide had\\nagain made; and as the beams of the morning sun glanced on the water,\\nthe same billows which appeared so dreadful in the darkness appeared to\\ndance merrily.\\n\\nI felt hungry; I took up a red herring from one of the baskets, and tore\\nit to pieces with my teeth.  I looked around me in every quarter to see\\nif there was any vessel in sight, but there was nothing to be seen but\\nnow and then a screaming sea-gull.  I tried to rouse my companion by\\nkicking her with my foot; I did not succeed in waking her up, but she\\nturned round on her back, and, her hair falling from her face,\\ndiscovered the features of a young and pretty person, apparently not\\nmore than nineteen or twenty years old; her figure was slight and well\\nformed.\\n\\nYoung as I was, I thought it a pity that such a nice-looking person--for\\nshe still was so, although in a state of disorder, and very dirty--\\nshould be so debased by intoxication; and as I looked at the bladder,\\nstill half full of spirits I seized it with an intention to throw it\\noverboard, when I paused at the recollection that it had probably saved\\nmy life during the night, and might yet be required.\\n\\nI did not like to alter the course of the boat, although I perceived\\nthat we were running fast from the land; for although the sea had gone\\ndown considerably, there was still too much for the boat to be put\\nbroadside to it.  I cannot say that I was unhappy; I found my situation\\nso very much improved to what it was during the darkness of the night.\\nThe sun shone bright, and I felt its warmth.  I had no idea of being\\nlost--death did not enter my thoughts.  There was plenty to eat, and\\nsome vessel would certainly pick us up.  Nevertheless, I said my\\nprayers, more devoutly than I usually did.\\n\\nAbout noon, as near as I could guess, the tide changed again, and as the\\nwind had lulled very much, there was little or no swell.  I thought\\nthat, now that the motion was not so great, we might possibly ship the\\nforemast and make some little sail upon the boat; and I tried again more\\nearnestly to rouse up my companion; after a few not very polite\\nattempts, I succeeded in ascertaining that she was alive.\\n\\n\"Be quiet, Jim,\" said she, with her eyes still closed; \"it\\'s not five\\nbells yet.\"\\n\\nAnother kick or two, and she turned herself round and stared wildly.\\n\\n\"Jim,\" said she, rubbing her eyes, and then she looked about her, and at\\nonce she appeared to remember what had passed; she shrieked, and covered\\nher face up with her hands.\\n\\n\"I thought it was a dream, and was going to tell Jim all about it, at\\nbreakfast,\" said she, sorrowfully, \"but it\\'s all true--true as gospel.\\nWhat will become of me?  We are lost, lost, lost!\"\\n\\n\"We are not lost, but we should have been lost this night if I had been\\nas drunk as you have been,\" replied I; \"I\\'ve had work enough to keep the\\nboat above water, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s truth,\" replied she, rising up and taking a seat upon the thwart\\nof the boat.  \"God, forgive me, poor wretch that I am: what will Jim\\nthink, and what will he say, when he sees my best bonnet in such a\\npickle?\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure that you\\'ll ever see Jim again, or that you\\'ll ever\\nwant your best bonnet?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true.  If one\\'s body is to be tossed about by green waves, it\\'s\\nlittle matter whether there\\'s a bonnet or shawl on.  Where are we, do\\nyou know?\"\\n\\n\"I can just see the land out there,\" replied I, pointing astern.  \"The\\nsea is smooth; I think we could ship the foremast, and get sail upon\\nher.\"\\n\\nThe young woman stood up in the boat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"I\\'m pretty steady; I think we could.  Last night in\\nthe dark and the tossing sea I could do nothing, but now I can.  What a\\nblessing is daylight to cowards like me--I am only afraid in the dark.\\nWe must put some sail upon the boat, or nobody will see us.  What did\\nyou do with the bladder of liquor?\"\\n\\n\"Threw it overboard,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Had you courage to do that?--and watching through the the night so wet\\nand cold.  Well you did right--I could not have done it.  Oh! that\\nliquor--that liquor; I wish there wasn\\'t such a thing in the world, but\\nit\\'s too late now.  When I first married James Pearson, and the garland\\nwas hung to the main-stay of the frigate, nobody could persuade me to\\ntouch it, not even James himself, whom I loved so much.  Instead of\\nquarrelling with me for not drinking it, as he used to do, he now\\nquarrels with me for drinking the most.  If you\\'ll come forward, sir,\\nand help me, we\\'ll soon get up the foremast.  This is it, you see, with\\nthe jib passed round it.  Jim often says that I\\'d make a capital sailor,\\nif I\\'d only enter in man\\'s clothes--but as I tell him, I should be put\\nup at the gangway, for not being sober, before I\\'d been on board a\\nweek.\"\\n\\nWe contrived to ship the mast, and set the jib and foresail.  As soon as\\nthe sheets were hauled aft, my companion took the steering lines,\\nsaying, \"I know how to manage her well enough, now it\\'s daylight, and\\nI\\'m quite sober.  You must be very tired, sir; so sit down on the\\nthwart, or lie down if you please, and take a nap; all\\'s safe enough\\nnow--see, we lie up well for the land;\" and such was the case, for she\\nhad brought the boat to the wind, and we skimmed over the waves at the\\nrate of three or four miles an hour.  I had no inclination to sleep; I\\nbaled the boat out thoroughly, and put the baskets and boxes into some\\nkind of order.  I then sat down on the thwarts, first looking round for\\na vessel in sight; but seeing none, I entered into conversation with my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Peggy Pearson; I have my marriage lines to show: they can throw nothing\\nin my face, except that I\\'m fond of liquor, God forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"And what makes you so fond of it now, since you say that, when you were\\nmarried, you did not care for it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well say that: it all came of _sipping_.  James would have me\\non his knee, and would insist on my taking a sip; and to please him I\\ndid, although it made me almost sick at first, and then after a while I\\ndid not mind it; and then, you see, when I was waiting at the sallyport\\nwith the other women, the wind blowing fresh, and the spray wetting us\\nas we stood on the shingle with our arms wrapped up in our aprons,\\nlooking out for a boat from the ship to come on shore, they would have a\\nquartern, and make me take a drop; and so it went on.  Then James made\\nme bring him liquor on board, and I drank some with him; but what\\nfinished me was, that I heard something about James when he was at\\nPlymouth, which made me jealous, and then for the first time I got\\ntipsy.  After that, it was all over with me; but, as I said before, it\\nbegan with sipping--worse luck, but it\\'s done now.  Tell me what has\\npassed during the night.  Has the weather been very bad?\"\\n\\nI told her what had occurred, and how I had kicked her to wake her up.\\n\\n\"Well, I deserved more than kicking, and you\\'re a fine, brave fellow;\\nand if we get on board the Calliope again--and I trust to God we shall--\\nI\\'ll take care to blow the trumpet for you as you deserve.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any one to blow the trumpet for me,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you be proud; a good word from me may be of use to you and it\\'s\\nwhat you deserve.  The ship\\'s company will think highly of you, I can\\ntell you.  A good name is of no small value--a captain has found out\\nthat before now; you\\'re only a lad, but you\\'re a regular trump, and the\\nseamen shall all know it, and the officers too.\"\\n\\n\"We must get on board the ship first,\" replied I, \"and we are a long way\\nfrom it just now.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re all right, and I have no fear.  If we don\\'t see a vessel we shall\\nfetch the land somewhere before to-morrow morning, and it don\\'t look as\\nif there would be any more bad weather.  I wonder if they have sent\\nanything out to look after us?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said I, pointing astern, \"it\\'s a sail of some kind.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Peggy, \"so it is; it\\'s a square-rigged vessel coming up the\\nChannel--we had better get on the other tack, and steer for her.\"\\n\\nWe wore the boat round and ran in the direction of the vessel; in three\\nhours we were close to her; I hailed her as she came down upon us but no\\none appeared to hear us or see us, for she had lower studding-sails set,\\nand there was no one forward.  We hailed again, and the vessel was now\\nwithin twenty yards, and we were right across her bows; a man came\\nforward, and cried out, \"Starboard your helm,\" but not in sufficient\\ntime to prevent the vessel from striking the wherry, and to stave her\\nquarter in; we dropped alongside as the wherry filled with water, and we\\nwere hauled in by the seamen over the gunwale, just as she turned over\\nand floated away astern.\\n\\n\"Touch and go, my lad,\" said one of the seamen who had hauled me on\\nboard.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you keep a better look out?\" said Peggy Pearson, shaking her\\npetticoats, which were wet up to the knees.  \"Paint eyes in the bows of\\nyour brig, if you haven\\'t any yourself.  Now you\\'ve lost a boatful of\\nred-herrings, eggs, and soft tommy--no bad things after a long cruise;\\nwe meant to have paid our passage with them--now you must take us for\\nnothing.\"\\n\\nThe master of the vessel, who was on deck, observed that I was in the\\nuniform of an officer.  He asked me how it was we were found in such a\\nsituation?  I narrated what had passed in few words.  He said that he\\nwas from Cadiz bound to London, and that he would put us on shore at any\\nplace up the river I would like, but that he could not lose the chance\\nof the fair wind to land me anywhere else.\\n\\nI was too thankful to be landed anywhere; and telling him that I should\\nbe very glad if he could put me on shore at Sheerness, which was the\\nnearest place to Chatham, I asked leave to turn into one of the cabin\\nbed-places, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that I had been seen by the sentry abaft to\\ngo down by the stern ladder into the boat, and when the waterman came\\nback shortly afterwards to haul his boat up, and perceived that it had\\ngone adrift, there was much alarm on my account.  It was too dark to\\nsend a boat after us that night, but the next morning the case was\\nreported to the admiral of the port, who directed a cutter to get under\\nweigh and look for us.\\n\\nThe cutter had kept close in shore for the first day, and it was on the\\nmorning after I was picked up by the brig, that, in standing more out,\\nshe had fallen in with the wherry, bottom up.  This satisfied them that\\nwe had perished in the rough night, and it was so reported to the\\nport-admiral and to Captain Delmar, who had just come down from London.\\n\\nI slept soundly till the next morning, when I found that the wind had\\nfallen and that it was nearly calm.  Peggy Pearson was on deck; she had\\nwashed herself and smoothed out with an iron the ribbons of her bonnet,\\nand was really a very handsome young woman.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said she, \"I didn\\'t know your name before you told it to\\nthe skipper here; you\\'re in a pretty scrape.  I don\\'t know what Jim\\nPearson will say when you go back, running away with his wife as you\\nhave done.  Don\\'t you think I had better go back first, and smooth\\nthings over.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you laugh now,\" replied I; \"but you didn\\'t laugh the night we went\\nadrift.\"\\n\\n\"Because it was no laughing matter.  I owe my life to you, and if I had\\nbeen adrift by myself, I should never have put my foot on shore again.\\nDo you know,\" said she to me, very solemnly, \"I\\'ve made a vow--yes, a\\nvow to Heaven, that I\\'ll leave off drinking; and I only hope I may have\\nstrength given me to keep it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you keep it?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think I can; for when I reflect that I might have gone to my account\\nin that state, I really feel a horror of liquor.  If James would only\\ngive it up, I\\'m sure I could.  I swear that I never will bring him any\\nmore on board--that\\'s settled.  He may scold me, he may beat me (I don\\'t\\nthink he would do that, for he never has yet); but let him do what he\\npleases, I never will; and if he keeps sober because he hasn\\'t the means\\nof getting tipsy, I am sure that I shall keep my vow.  You don\\'t know\\nhow I hate myself; and although I\\'m merry, it\\'s only to prevent my\\nsitting down and crying like a child at my folly and wickedness in\\nyielding to temptation.\"\\n\\n\"I little thought to hear this from you.  When I was with you in the\\nboat, I thought you a very different person.\"\\n\\n\"A woman who drinks, Mr Keene, is lost to everything.  I\\'ve often\\nthought of it, after I\\'ve become sober again.  Five years ago I was the\\nbest girl in the school.  I was the monitor and wore a medal for good\\nconduct.  I thought that I should be so happy with James; I loved him\\nso, and do so still.  I knew that he was fond of liquor, but I never\\nthought that he would make me drink.  I thought then that I should cure\\nhim, and with the help of God I will now; not only him, but myself too.\"\\n\\nAnd I will here state that Peggy Pearson, whose only fault was the\\npassion she had imbibed for drinking, did keep her vow; the difficulty\\nof which few can understand who have not been intemperate themselves;\\nand she not only continued sober herself, but by degrees broke her\\nhusband of his similar propensity to liquor.\\n\\nIt was not till the evening of the fourth that we arrived at the Nore.\\nI had four pounds in my pocket at the time that I went adrift, which was\\nmore than sufficient, even if I had not intended to go and see my\\nmother.  A wherry came alongside, and Peggy Pearson and I stepped into\\nit, after I had thanked the captain, and given a sovereign to the seamen\\nto drink my health.\\n\\nAs soon as we landed at Sheerness I gave another of my sovereigns to\\nPeggy, and left her to find her way back to Portsmouth, while I walked\\nup to Chatham to my mother\\'s house.\\n\\nIt was past eight o\\'clock and quite dark when I arrived; the shop was\\nclosed, and the shutters up at the front door; so I went round to the\\nback to obtain admittance.  The door was not fast, and I walked into the\\nlittle parlour without meeting with anybody.  I heard somebody upstairs,\\nand I thought I heard sobbing; it then struck me that my supposed loss\\nmight have been communicated to my mother.  There was a light on the\\nparlour table, and I perceived an open letter lying near to it.  I\\nlooked at it; it was the handwriting of Captain Delmar.  The candle\\nrequired snuffing; I raised the letter to the light that I might read\\nit, and read as follows:--\\n\\n  \"MY DEAR ARABELLA:--\\n\\n  \"You must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings, and it is most\\n  painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them.\\n  A dreadful accident has occurred, and indeed I feel most sincerely for\\n  you.  On the night of the 10th, Percival was in a boat which broke\\n  adrift from the ship in a gale of wind; it was dark, and the fact not\\n  known until too late to render any assistance.\\n\\n  \"The next day a cutter was despatched by the admiral to look for the\\n  boat, which must have been driven out to sea; there was a woman in the\\n  boat as well as _our_ poor boy.  Alas!  I regret to say that the boat\\n  was found bottom up, and there is no doubt but that _our_ dear child\\n  has perished.\\n\\n  \"You will believe me when I say that I deeply lament his loss; not\\n  only on your account, but because I had become most partial to him for\\n  his many good qualities, and often have I regretted that his peculiar\\n  position prevented me from showing him openly that regard which, as\\n  _his father_, I really felt for him.\\n\\n  \"I know that I can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings,\\n  and yet I fain would, for you have been so true, and anxious to please\\n  me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy, that\\n  there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands.\\n\\n  \"Comfort yourself, dear Arabella, as well as you can with the\\n  reflection that it has been the will of Heaven, to whose decrees we\\n  must submit with resignation.  I am deeply suffering myself; for, had\\n  he lived, I swear to you that I intended to do much more for him than\\n  ever I had promised you.  He would have made a good and gallant sailor\\n  had it pleased Heaven to spare him, and you would have been proud of\\n  him; but it has been decided otherwise, and we must bow in obedience\\n  to His will.  God bless you, and support you in your afflictions, and\\n  believe me still,\\n\\n  \"Yours, most sincerely and faithfully,\\n\\n  \"PERCIVAL DELMAR.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is so,\" thought I; \"here I have it under his own hand.\"  I\\nimmediately folded up the letter, and put it into my bosom.  \"You and I\\nnever part, that is certain,\" murmured I.  I had almost lost my breath\\nfrom emotion, and I sat down to recover myself.  After a minute or two I\\npulled the letter out and read it over again.  \"And he is my father, and\\nhe loves me, but dare not show it, and he intended to do more for me\\nthan even he had promised my mother.\"\\n\\nI folded up the letter, kissed it fervently, and replaced it in my\\nbosom.  \"Now,\" thought I, \"what shall I do?  This letter will be\\nrequired of me by my mother, but never shall she get it; not tears, nor\\nthreats, nor entreaties shall ever induce me to part with it.  What\\nshall I do?  Nobody has seen me--nobody knows that I have been here.  I\\nwill go directly and join my ship; yes, that will be my best plan.\"\\n\\nI was so occupied with my own reverie, that I did not perceive a\\nfootstep on the stairs, until the party was so far down that I could not\\nretreat.  I thought to hide myself.  I knew by the list shoes that it\\nmust be my grandmother.  A moment of reflection.  I blew out the light\\non the table, and put myself in an attitude: one arm raised aloft, the\\nother extended from my body, and with my mouth wide open and my eyes\\nfixed, I awaited her approach.  She came in--saw me--uttered a fearful\\nshriek, and fell senseless on the floor; the candle in her hand was\\nextinguished in the fall: I stepped over her body; and darting out into\\nthe back-yard, gained the door, and was in the street in a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\\n\\nI was soon in the high road, and clear of the town of Chatham.  As my\\nobject was that it should not be supposed that I had been there, I made\\nall the haste I could to increase my distance; I therefore walked on in\\nthe direction of Gravesend, where I arrived about ten o\\'clock.  A return\\nchaise offered to take me to Greenwich for a few shillings, and before\\nmorning dawned I had gained the metropolis.\\n\\nI lost no time in inquiring when the coaches started for Portsmouth, and\\nfound that I was in plenty of time, as one set off at nine o\\'clock.\\n\\nMuch as I wished to see London, my curiosity gave way to what I\\nconsidered the necessity of my immediate return to the frigate.  At\\nseven o\\'clock in the evening I arrived at Portsmouth; I hastened down,\\njumped into a wherry, and was on board of the frigate again by eight.\\n\\nIt may be imagined that my sudden and unexpected appearance caused no\\nlittle surprise.  Indeed, the first lieutenant considered it right to\\nsend the gig on shore at that late hour to apprise the captain of my\\nreturn, and Bob Cross had just time to give me a wring of the hand\\nbefore he jumped into the boat, and went away to make the report.\\n\\nI gave a history of my adventures to the officers, leaving them,\\nhowever, to suppose that I had never been to Chatham, but had gone up to\\nLondon in the merchant vessel.\\n\\nPearson, the boatswain\\'s mate, came to make inquiries about his wife;\\nand, soon after, Bob Cross came on board with the captain\\'s orders, that\\nI should go on shore to him in the gig on the following morning.\\n\\nI wished very much to consult Bob Cross previous to my seeing the\\ncaptain.  I told him so, and he agreed to meet me on the gangway about\\nten o\\'clock, as by that time the officers would be almost all in bed,\\nand there would be less chance of interruption.\\n\\nIt was a fine, clear night, and as soon as we found ourselves alone I\\nnarrated to him, in a low voice, all that had taken place, and gave him\\nthe contents of the letter which I had taken possession of.  I then\\nasked him what he thought I ought to do, now that I was certain of being\\nthe son of the captain.\\n\\n\"Why, Master Keene, you have done it very cleverly, that\\'s the truth;\\nand that letter, which is as good as a certificate from Captain Delmar,\\nmust be taken great care of.  I hardly know where it ought to be put,\\nbut I think the best thing will be for me to sew it in a seal-skin pouch\\nthat I have, and then you can wear it round your neck, and next your\\nskin; for, as you say, you and that must never part company.  But,\\nMaster Keene, you must be silent as death about it.  You have told me,\\nand I hope I may be trusted, but trust nobody else.  As to saying or\\nhinting anything to the captain, you mustn\\'t think of it; you must go on\\nas before, as if you knew nothing, for if he thought you had the letter\\nin your possession he would forget you were his son, and perhaps hate\\nyou.  He never would have been induced to acknowledge you under his own\\nhand as his son had he not thought that you were dead and gone, as\\neverybody else did; so behave just as respectful and distant as before.\\nIt\\'s only in some great emergency that that letter will do you any good,\\nand you must reserve it in case of need.  If your mother is suspicious,\\nwhy, you must blind her.  Your granny will swear that it was your ghost;\\nyour mother may think otherwise, but cannot prove it; she dare not tell\\nthe captain that she suspects you have the letter, and it will all blow\\nover after a cruise or two.\"\\n\\nI agreed to follow the advice of Bob Cross, as I saw it was good, and we\\nparted for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning I went on shore to the captain, who received me, very\\nstiffly, with, \"Mr Keene, you have had a narrow escape.  How did you\\nget back?\"\\n\\nI replied, that the vessel which picked me up was bound to London and\\nthat I had taken the coach down.\\n\\n\"Well, I never had an idea that we should have seen you again and I have\\nwritten to your mother, acquainting her with your loss.\"\\n\\n\"Have you, sir?\" replied I; \"it will make her very unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it will; but I shall write by this post, stating that you\\nhave been so fortunately preserved.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I; \"have you any further orders, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, Mr Keene; you may go on board and return to your duty.\"\\n\\nI made my bow, and quitted the room; went down below, and found Bob\\nCross waiting for me.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said he, as we walked away.\\n\\n\"Stiff as ever,\" replied I: \"told me to go on board and \\'tend to my\\nduty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I knew it would be so,\" replied Bob; \"it\\'s hard to say what stuff\\nthem great nobs are made of.  Never mind that; you\\'ve your own game to\\nplay, and your own secret to keep.\"\\n\\n\"His secret,\" replied I, biting my lips, \"to keep or to tell, as may\\nhappen.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let your vexation get the better of you, Master Keene; you\\'ve the\\nbest of it, if you only keep your temper; let him play his cards, and\\nyou play yours.  As you know his cards and he don\\'t know yours, you must\\nwin the game in the end--that is, if you are commonly prudent.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Cross,\" replied I; \"but you forget that I am but a boy.\"\\n\\n\"You are but a boy, Master Keene, but you\\'ve no fool\\'s head on your\\nshoulders.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" replied I; \"but here we are at the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and, as I live, here\\'s Peggy Pearson.  Well, Peggy, how did you\\nlike your cruise with Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"If I ever go on another, I hope he will be my companion.  Master Keene,\\nwill you allow me to go on board with you to see my husband?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Peggy,\" replied Cross; \"the first lieutenant would not refuse\\nyou after what has happened, nor Captain Delmar either, stiff as he is:\\nfor, although he never shows it, he don\\'t want feeling.  Jim will be\\nglad to see you, Peggy; you haven\\'t an idea how he took on, when he\\nheard of your loss.  He borrowed a pocket-handkerchief from the corporal\\nof marines.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect he\\'d rather borrow a bottle of rum from the purser,\" replied\\nPeggy.\\n\\n\"Recollect, Peggy,\" said I, holding up my finger.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I do recollect; I pledge you my word that I have not tasted\\na drop of spirits since we parted--and that with a sovereign in my\\npocket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, only keep to it--that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"I will, indeed, Mr Keene; and, what\\'s more, I shall love you as long\\nas I live.\"\\n\\nWe pulled on board in the gig, and Peggy was soon in the arms of her\\nhusband.  As Pearson embraced her at the gangway--for he could not help\\nit--the first lieutenant very kindly said, \"Pearson, I shan\\'t want you\\non deck till after dinner: you may go below with your wife.\"\\n\\n\"Now, may God bless you, for a cross-looking, kind-hearted gentleman,\"\\nsaid Peggy to the first lieutenant.\\n\\nPeggy was as good as her word to me; she gave such an account of my\\ncourage and presence of mind, of her fears and at last of her getting\\ntipsy--of my remaining at the helm and managing the boat all night by\\nmyself, that I obtained great reputation among the ship\\'s company, and\\nit was all reported to the officers, and worked its way until it came\\nfrom the first lieutenant to the captain, and from the captain to the\\nport admiral.  This is certain, that Peggy Pearson did do me a good\\nservice, for I was no longer looked upon as a mere youngster, who had\\njust come to sea, and who had not been tried.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bob Cross, a day or two afterwards, \"it seems, by\\nPeggy Pearson\\'s report, that you\\'re not frightened at a trifle.\"\\n\\n\"Peg Pearson\\'s report won\\'t do me much good.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know better, Master Keene, than to say that; a mouse may\\nhelp a lion, as the fable says.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you learn all your fables, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you; there\\'s a nice little girl that used to sit on my knee\\nand read her fables to me, and I listened to her because I loved her.\"\\n\\n\"And does she do so now?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; she\\'s too big for that--she\\'d blush up to the temples; but\\nnever mind the girl or the fables.  I told you that Peggy had reported\\nyour conduct, as we say in the service.  Now do you know, that this very\\nday I heard the first lieutenant speaking of it to the captain, and\\nyou\\'ve no idea how proud the captain looked, although he pretended to\\ncare nothing about it; I watched him, and he looked as much as to say,\\n`that\\'s my boy.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, if that pleases him, I\\'ll make him prouder yet of me, if I have\\nthe opportunity,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That you will, Master Keene, if I\\'m any judge of fizonomy; and that\\'s\\nthe way to go to a parent\\'s heart: make him feel proud of you.\"\\n\\nI did not forget this, as the reader will eventually discover.\\n\\nI had written to my mother, giving her a long account of my adventures,\\nbut not saying a word of my having been at Chatham.  I made her suppose,\\nas I did the captain, that I had been carried up to London.  My letter\\nreached her the day after the one announcing my safety, written to her\\nby Captain Delmar.\\n\\nShe answered me by return of post, thanking Heaven for my preservation,\\nand stating how great had been her anguish and misery at my supposed\\nloss.  In the latter part of the letter was this paragraph:--\\n\\n  \"Strange to say, on the night of the 16th, when I was on my bed in\\n  tears, having but just received the news of your loss, your\\n  grandmother went downstairs, and declares that she saw you or your\\n  ghost in the little back parlour.  At all events, I found her\\n  insensible on the floor, so that she must have seen something.  She\\n  might have been frightened at nothing; and yet I know not what to\\n  think, for there are circumstances which almost make _me_ believe that\\n  somebody was in the house.  I presume you can prove an _alibi_.\"\\n\\nThat my mother had been suspicious, perhaps more than suspicious, from\\nthe disappearance of the letter, I was convinced.  When I replied to\\nher, I said:--\\n\\n  \"My _alibi_ is easily proved by applying to the master and seamen of\\n  the vessel on board of which I was.  Old granny must have been\\n  frightened at her own shadow: the idea of my coming to your house, and\\n  having left it without seeing you is rather too absurd; granny must\\n  have invented the story, because she hates me, and thought to make you\\n  do the same.\"\\n\\nWhatever my mother may have thought, she did not again mention the\\nsubject.  I had, however, a few days afterwards, a letter from my aunt\\nMilly, in which she laughingly told the same story of granny swearing\\nthat she had seen me or my ghost.  \"At first we thought it was your\\nghost, but since a letter from Captain Delmar to your mother has been\\nmissing, it is now imagined that you have been here, and have taken\\npossession of it.  You will tell me, my dearest Percival, I\\'m sure, if\\nyou did play this trick to granny, or not; you know you may trust me\\nwith any of your tricks.\"\\n\\nBut I was not in this instance to be wheedled by my aunt.  I wrote in\\nreturn, saying how much I was amazed at my grandmother telling such\\nfibs, and proved to her most satisfactorily that I was in London at the\\ntime they supposed I might have been at Chatham.\\n\\nThat my aunt had been requested by my mother to try to find out the\\ntruth, I was well convinced: but I felt my secret of too much importance\\nto trust either of them and from that time the subject was never\\nmentioned; and I believe it was at last surmised that the letter might\\nhave been destroyed accidentally or purposely by the maid-servant, and\\nthat my grandmother had been frightened at nothing at all--an opinion\\nmore supported, as the maid, who had taken advantage of my mother\\'s\\nretiring to her room, and had been out gossiping, declared that she had\\nnot left the premises three minutes, and not a soul could have come in.\\nMoreover, it was so unlikely that I could have been in Chatham without\\nbeing recognised by somebody.\\n\\nMy grandmother shook her head, and said nothing during all this\\ncanvassing of the question; but my aunt Milly declared that I never\\nwould have been at Chatham without coming to see her.  And it was her\\nopinion that the servant girl had read the letter when left on the\\ntable, and had taken it out to show to her associates; and somebody who\\nwished to have a hold upon my mother by the possession of the letter had\\nretained it.\\n\\nI think my mother came to that opinion at last, and it was the source of\\nmuch uneasiness to her.  She dared not say a word to Captain Delmar, and\\nevery day expected to have an offer made of returning the letter, upon a\\ncertain sum being paid down.  But the offer was never made, as the\\nletter had been sewed up by Bob Cross in the piece of seal-skin, and was\\nworn round my neck with a ribbon, with as much care as if it had been a\\nsupposed bit of the wood of the true cross, possessed by some old female\\nCatholic devotee.\\n\\nBut long before all these discussions were over, H.M. ship Calliope had\\nbeen ordered to sail, and was steering down the Channel before a smart\\nbreeze.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough I have so much to say as to oblige me to pass over without\\nnotice the majority of my companions, I think I ought to dedicate one\\nchapter to a more particular description of those with whom I was now\\nprincipally in contact on board of the Calliope.\\n\\nI have already spoken much of the Honourable Captain Delmar, but I must\\ndescribe him more particularly.  When young, he must have been a very\\nhandsome man; even now, although nearly fifty years of age, and his hair\\nand whiskers a little mixed with grey, he was a fine-looking personage,\\nof florid complexion, large blue eyes, nose and mouth very perfect: in\\nheight he was full six feet; and he walked so erect that he looked even\\ntaller.\\n\\nThere was precision, I may say dignity, in all his motions.  If he\\nturned to you, it was slowly and deliberately; there was nothing like\\nrapidity in his movement.  On the most trifling occasions, he wrapped\\nhimself up in etiquette with all the consequence of a Spanish Hidalgo;\\nand showed in almost every action and every word that he never forgot\\nhis superiority of birth.\\n\\nNo one, except myself, perhaps, would ever have thought of taking a\\nliberty with him; for although there was a pomposity about him, at the\\nsame time it was the pomposity of a high-bred gentleman, who respected\\nhimself, and expected every one to do the same.\\n\\nThat sometimes a little mirth was occasioned by his extreme precision is\\ntrue; but it was whispered, not boldly indulged in.  As to his qualities\\nas an officer and seaman, I shall only say, that they were considered\\nmore than respectable.  Long habit of command had given him a fair\\nknowledge of the duties in the first instance, and he never condescended\\n(indeed, it would have been contrary to his character) to let the\\nofficers or seamen know whether he did or did not know anything about\\nthe second.\\n\\nAs to his moral character, I can only say, that it was very difficult to\\nascertain it.  That he would never do that which was in the slightest\\ndegree derogatory to the character of a gentleman was most certain: but\\nhe was so wrapped up in exclusiveness, that it was almost impossible to\\nestimate his feelings.  Occasionally, I may say very rarely, he might\\nexpress them; but if he did, it was but for a moment, and he was again\\nreserved as before.\\n\\nThat he was selfish is true; but who is not? and those in high rank are\\nstill more so than others, not so much by nature, but because their self\\nis encouraged by those around them.  You could easily offend his pride\\nbut he was above being flattered in a gross way.  I really believe that\\nthe person in the ship for whom he had the least respect was the\\nobsequious Mr Culpepper.  Such was the Honourable Captain Delmar.\\n\\nMr Hippesley, the first lieutenant, was a broad-shouldered,\\nungainly-looking personage.  He had more the appearance of a master in\\nthe service than a first lieutenant.  He was a thorough seaman; and\\nreally, for a first lieutenant, a very good-natured man.  All that was\\nrequisite, was to allow his momentary anger to have free escape by the\\nsafety-valve of his mouth: if you did not, an explosion was sure to be\\nthe result.\\n\\nHe was, as we use the term at sea, a regular ship husband--that is to\\nsay, he seldom put his foot on shore; and if he did, he always appeared\\nanxious to get on board again.  He was on good terms, but not familiar,\\nwith his messmates, and very respectful to the captain.  There was no\\nother officer in the service who would have suited Captain Delmar so\\nwell as Mr Hippesley, who, although he might occasionally grumble at\\nnot being promoted, appeared on the whole to be very indifferent about\\nthe matter.\\n\\nThe men were partial to him, as they always are to one who, whatever may\\nbe his peculiarities, is consistent.  Nothing is more unpleasant to men\\nthan to sail under a person whom, to use their own expression, \"they\\nnever knew where to find.\"\\n\\nThe second and third lieutenants, Mr Percival and Mr Weymss, were\\nyoung men of good family, and were admitted to a very slight degree of\\nfamiliarity with Captain Delmar: they were of gentlemanly manners, both\\ngood seamen, and kind to their inferiors.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, the purser, was my abomination--a nasty, earwigging,\\nflattering, bowing old rogue.  The master, Mr Smith, was a very quiet\\nman, plain and unoffending, but perfectly master of, and always\\nattentive to, his duty.\\n\\nThe marine officer, Mr Tusk, was a nonentity put into a red jacket.\\nThe surgeon was a tall, and very finicking sort of gentleman as to\\ndress; but well informed, friendly in disposition, and perfectly\\nacquainted with his profession.\\n\\nMy messmates were most of them young men of good birth, with the\\nexception of Tommy Dott, who was the son of a warrant officer, and Mr\\nGreen, whose father was a boot-maker in London.  I shall not, however,\\nwaste my reader\\'s time upon them; they will appear when required.  I\\nshall, therefore, now proceed with my narrative.\\n\\nIt is usually the custom for the midshipmen to take up provisions and\\nspirits beyond their allowance, and pay the purser an extra sum for the\\nsame; but this Mr Culpepper would not permit--indeed, he was the most\\nstingy and disagreeable old fellow that I ever met with in the service.\\nWe never had dinner or grog enough, or even lights sufficient for our\\nwants.\\n\\nWe complained to the first lieutenant, but he was not inclined to assist\\nus: he said we had our allowance, and it was all we could demand; that\\ntoo much grog was bad for us, and as for candles, they only made us sit\\nup late when we ought to be in bed: he was, moreover, very strict about\\nthe lights being put out.  This, however, was the occasion of war to the\\nknife between the midshipmen and Mr Culpepper.\\n\\nBut it was of no avail; he would seldom trust his own steward or the\\nmate of the main deck; whenever he could, he superintended the serving\\nout of all provisions and mixing of the grog: no wonder that he was said\\nto be a rich man.  The only party to whom he was civil was Mr\\nHippesley, the first lieutenant, and the captain; both of whom had the\\npower of annoying him, and reducing his profits.\\n\\nTo the captain he was all humility; every expense that he required was,\\nwith his proffered bow, cheerfully submitted to; but he gained on the\\nwhole by this apparent liberality, as the captain was rather inclined to\\nprotect him in all other points of service, except those connected with\\nhis own comforts and luxuries; and many a good job did Mr Culpepper get\\ndone for him, by humbly requesting and obsequiously bowing.\\n\\nWe had been at sea for about a week, and were running down towards the\\nisland of Madeira, which we expected to reach the next morning.  Our\\ndestination was a secret, as our captain sailed with sealed orders, to\\nbe opened when off that island.\\n\\nThe weather was very fine and warm, and the wind had fallen, when at\\nsundown high land was reported from the mast-head, at about forty miles\\ndistant.  I was, as on the former cruise, signal midshipman, and did day\\nduty--that is, I went down with the sun, and kept no night watch.\\n\\nI had been cogitating how I could play some trick to Mr Culpepper: the\\nmidshipmen had often proposed that we should do so, but I had made up my\\nmind that, whenever I did, I would make no confidant.  Tommy Dott often\\nsuggested an idea, but I invariably refused, as a secret is only a\\nsecret when it is known to one person: for that reason I never consulted\\nBob Cross, because I knew that he would have persuaded me not to do so;\\nbut after anything was happily executed, I then used to confide in him.\\n\\nI observed before that Mr Culpepper wore a flaxen wig, and I felt sure,\\nfrom his penuriousness, that he was not likely to have more than one on\\nboard.  I, therefore, fixed upon his wig as the object of my vengeance,\\nand having made up my mind on the night that we made the island of\\nMadeira, I determined to put my project in execution.\\n\\nFor convenience, the first lieutenant had a small ladder which went down\\nthrough the skylight of the gun-room so that they could descend direct,\\ninstead of going round by the after-hatchway, and entering by the\\ngun-room doors, where the sentry was placed.\\n\\nI went to my hammock and slept till the middle watch was called; I then\\ngot up and dressed myself without being perceived.\\n\\nAs soon as the lieutenant of the middle watch had been called by the\\nmate, who lighted his candle and left him to dress himself, I came up by\\nthe after-ladder, and, watching an opportunity when the sentry at the\\ncaptain\\'s cabin door had walked forward, I softly descended by the\\nskylight ladder into the gun-room.\\n\\nThe light in the cabin of the lieutenant, who was dressing, was quite\\nsufficient, and the heat of the weather was so great, that all the\\nofficers slept with their cabin doors fastened back, for ventilation; I\\nhad, therefore, no difficulty in putting my hand on the purser\\'s wig,\\nwith which I escaped unperceived, and immediately turned in again to my\\nhammock, to consider what I should do with my prize.\\n\\nShould I throw it overboard; should I stuff it down the pump-well, or\\nslip it into the ship\\'s coppers, that it might re-appear when the\\npea-soup was baled out or dinner; or should I put it into the manger\\nforward, where the pigs were?\\n\\nIn the meantime, while I was considering the matter, the midshipman of\\nthe first watch came down and turned in, and all was again quiet, except\\nan occasional nasal melody from some heavy sleeper.\\n\\nAt last, quite undecided, I peeped through the clews of my hammock to\\nsee what the sentry at the gun-room door was about, and found that he\\nhad sat down on a chest, and was fast asleep.  I knew immediately that\\nthe man was in my power, and I did not fear him; and then it was that\\nthe idea came into my head, that I would singe the purser\\'s wig.  I went\\nsoftly to the sentry\\'s light, took it from the hook, and went down with\\nit into the cockpit, as being the best place for carrying on my\\noperations.  The wig was very greasy, and every curl, as I held it in\\nthe candle, flared up, and burned beautifully to within a quarter of an\\ninch of the caul.\\n\\nIt was soon done, and I replaced the sentry\\'s light; and finding that\\nthe gun-room door was a-jar, I went in softly, and replaced the wig\\nwhere I had taken it from, repassed the sentry, who was still fast\\nasleep, and regained my hammock, intending to undress myself in it; but\\nI had quite forgotten one thing (I was soon reminded of it)--I heard the\\nvoice of the officer of the watch I calling out to the sentry at the\\ncabin door--\\n\\n\"Sentry, what\\'s that smell of burning?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, sir,\" replied the sentry; \"I was just thinking of going\\nforward for the ship\\'s corporal.\"\\n\\nThe smell, which had gradually ascended from the cockpit, now spread\\nfrom deck to deck, and became stronger and stronger.  The gun-room-door\\nsentry jumped up at the voice of the lieutenant, and called out that\\nthere was a very strong smell in the cockpit.  The lieutenant and mate\\nof the watch came down, and it was immediately supposed that the\\nspirit-room had caught fire, for the smell was really very powerful.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant, who had wakened up at the voices, was out in a\\nminute; he put his head over the cockpit, and ordering the officer of\\nthe watch to call the drummer, and beat to quarters, ran up to inform\\nthe captain.\\n\\nThe drummer was out in a moment, and, seizing his drum, which hung up by\\nthe mainmast, ran up in his shirt and beat the tattoo.\\n\\nThe whole ship\\'s company rose up at the sound, which they knew was the\\nsignal for something important; and the beat of the drum was followed up\\nby the shrill piping of the boatswain\\'s mates at each hatchway.\\n\\nAt that moment, some frightened man belonging to the watch cried out\\nthat the ship was on fire, and the lower decks were immediately a scene\\nof bustle and confusion.\\n\\nPerhaps there is nothing more awful than the alarm of fire at sea; the\\nfeeling that there is no escape--the only choice being by which element,\\nfire or water, you choose to perish.  But if it is awful in daylight,\\nhow much more so is it to be summoned up to await such peril when you\\nhave been sleeping in fancied bounty.\\n\\nThe captain had hurried on his clothes, and stood on the quarter-deck.\\nHe was apparently calm and collected; but, as usual, the first\\nlieutenant carried on the duty, and well he did it.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the gunner?  Mr Hutt, bring up the keys from my cabin, and\\nhave all ready for clearing the magazines if required.  Firemen, get\\nyour buckets to bear; carpenters, rig the pumps.  Silence there, fore\\nand aft.\"\\n\\nBut the confusion became very great, and there evidently was a panic.\\nThe captain then interposed, calling out to the boatswain and his mates\\nto send every man aft on the quarter-deck.\\n\\nThis order was obeyed; the men came thronging like a flock of sheep,\\nhuddling together and breathless.\\n\\n\"Silence there, my men,\" cried Captain Delmar--\"silence.  I say; is this\\nthe conduct of men-of-war\\'s-men?  Every man of you sit down on deck--\\npass the word there for every man to sit down.\"\\n\\nThe order was mechanically obeyed, and as soon as the ship\\'s company\\nwere all seated, the captain said--\\n\\n\"I tell you what, my lads, I\\'m ashamed of you: the way to put out a fire\\nis to be cool and calm, obeying orders and keeping silence.  Now collect\\nyourselves, all of you, for until you are all quiet and cool, you will\\nsit where you are.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause of a few seconds--\\n\\n\"Now, my men, are you more steady?  Recollect, be cool, and keep\\nsilence.  Carpenter, are the pumps rigged?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the carpenter.\\n\\n\"Now, firemen, go for your buckets; let nobody else move.  Silence--not\\na word: three foremast guns main-deck, to your quarters.  Silence and\\nquiet, if you please.  Now, are you all steady?--then, to your quarters,\\nmy men, and wait for orders.\"\\n\\nIt was astonishing how collected the ship\\'s company became by the\\njudicious conduct of the captain, who now continued to command.  When\\nthe men had gone down to their stations, he directed the two junior\\nlieutenants to go and examine where the fire was, and to be careful not\\nto lift the hatches if they discovered that it was in the spirit-room.\\n\\nI had been on the quarter-deck some time, and, being aware of the cause,\\nof course was not at all alarmed: and I had exerted myself very\\nassiduously in keeping the men cool and quiet, shoving the men down who\\nwere unwilling to sit down on the deck, and even using them very\\nroughly; showing a great deal more _sang froid_ than any other of the\\nofficers, which of course was not to be wondered at.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who was most terribly alarmed, had come up on deck, and\\nstood trembling close to the side of the captain and first lieutenant;\\nhe had pulled on his wig without discovering that it had been burnt, and\\nas I passed him, the burnt smell was very strong indeed; so thought the\\ncaptain and the first lieutenant, who were waiting the return of the\\nofficers.\\n\\n\"I smell the fire very strong just now,\" said the captain to the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, every now and then it is very strong,\" replied the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\nThe purser\\'s wig was just between them,--no wonder that they smelt it.\\nAfter two or three minutes the officers came up, and reported that they\\ncould discover no fire, and that there was very little smell of fire\\ndown below.\\n\\n\"And yet I smell it now,\" said Captain Delmar.\\n\\n\"So do I, sir,\" said the second lieutenant; \"and it really smells\\nstronger on deck than it does down below.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very odd; let them continue the search.\"\\n\\nThe search was continued; the first lieutenant now going down, and after\\na time they said that the strongest smell was from the purser\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\"Mr Culpepper, they say the smell is in your cabin,\" said Captain\\nDelmar; \"go down, if you please; they may want to open your lockers.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who still trembled like an aspen, went down the ladder,\\nand I followed him; but in descending the second ladder his foot\\nslipped, and he fell down the hatchway to the lower deck.\\n\\nI hastened down after him; he was stunned, and I thought this a good\\nopportunity to pull off his wig, which I did very dexterously, and\\nconcealed it.  He was taken into the gun-room, and the surgeon called,\\nwhile I walked up on deck, and quietly dropped the wig overboard at the\\ngangway.\\n\\nMy reason for doing this was, that having no idea that my trick would\\nhave created so much confusion, and have turned up the officers and men\\nas it did, I thought that the purser\\'s wig would, the next morning,\\naccount for the smell of fire, and an investigation take place, which,\\nalthough it might not lead to discovery, would certainly lead to\\nsuspicion; so the wig was now floating away, and with the wig went away\\nall evidence.\\n\\nAfter a search of nearly half an hour, nothing was discovered; the\\ndrummer was ordered to beat the retreat, and all was quiet again.\\n\\nI went to bed quite satisfied with the events of the night, and slept\\nthe sleep of innocence--at least I slept just as soundly.\\n\\nThis mysterious affair ever remained a mystery: the only loss was the\\npurser\\'s wig, but that was nothing, as Mr Culpepper acknowledged that\\nhe did not know himself what he was about, and, for all he knew to the\\ncontrary, he might have thrown it overboard.\\n\\nMy conduct on this occasion again gained me great credit.  It had been\\nremarked by the captain and officers, and I rose in estimation.  How I\\nmight have behaved had I really supposed that the ship was on fire, is\\nquite another affair--I presume not quite so fearlessly.  As it was, I\\nwas resolved to take all the credit given to me and for that reason it\\nwas not till a long while afterwards, that I hinted the secret even to\\nBob Cross.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, when we arrived at Funchal, we found that our orders\\nwere for the West Indies: we stayed one day to take in wine and then\\nhove up the anchor, and went on to our destination.  We soon got into\\nthe trades, and run them fast down till we arrived at Carlisle Bay,\\nBarbadoes, where we found the admiral and delivered our despatches.  We\\nwere ordered to water and complete as soon as possible, as we were to be\\nsent on a cruise.\\n\\nTommy Dott, my quondam ally, was in disgrace.  He had several times\\nduring the cruise proposed that I should join him in several plots of\\nmischief, but I refused, as I did not consider them quite safe.\\n\\n\"You are not the keen fellow I thought you were,\" said he; \"you are up\\nto nothing now; there\\'s no fun in you, as there used to be.\"\\n\\nHe was mistaken; there was fun in me, but there was also prudence, and\\nfrom what I had latterly seen of Tommy Dott, I did not think he was to\\nbe trusted.\\n\\nThe day after we anchored at Carlisle Bay, Tommy came to me and said,\\n\"Old Culpepper serves out plums and suet this afternoon; I heard him\\ntell steward.  Now, I think we may manage to get some--I never saw\\nbetter plums on board of a ship.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I like raisins as well as you do, Tommy--but what is\\nyour plan?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve got my squirt: and old Culpepper never lights more than one\\nof his purser\\'s dips (small candles) in the steward\\'s room.  I\\'ll get\\ndown in the cockpit in the dark, and squirt at the candle--the water\\nwill put it out, and he\\'ll send the steward for another light, and then\\nI\\'ll try and get some.\"\\n\\nIt was not a bad plan, but still I refused to join in it, as it was only\\nthe work of one person, and not two.  I pointed that out to him and he\\nagreed with me, saying that he would do it himself.\\n\\nWhen Mr Culpepper went down into the steward\\'s room, Tommy\\nreconnoitred, and then came into the berth and filled his squirt.\\n\\nAlthough I would not join him, I thought I might as well see what was\\ngoing on and therefore descended the cockpit ladder soon after Tommy,\\nkeeping out of the way in the foremost part of the cockpit, where it was\\nquite dark.\\n\\nTommy directed his squirt very dexterously, hit the lighted wick of the\\nsolitary candle, which fizzed, sputtered, and finally gave up the ghost.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" said Mr Culpepper, \"what can that be?\"\\n\\n\"A leak from the seams above I suppose,\" said the steward:\\n\\n\"I will go to the gallery for another light.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, be quick,\" said Mr Culpepper, who remained in the steward\\'s\\nroom in the dark, until the return of the steward.\\n\\nTommy Dott then slipped in softly, and commenced filling all his pockets\\nwith the raisins; he had nearly taken in his full cargo, when, somehow\\nor another, Mr Culpepper stepped forward from where he stood, and he\\ntouched Tommy, whom he immediately seized crying out, \"Thieves!\\nthieves!--call the sentry!--sentry, come here.\"\\n\\nThe sentry of the gun-room door went down the ladder as Mr Culpepper\\ndragged out Tommy, holding him fast by both hands.\\n\\n\"Take him, sentry--take him in charge.  Call the master-at-arms--little\\nthief.  Mr Dott!  Hah--well, we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nThe consequence was, that Mr Tommy Dott was handed from the sentry to\\nthe master-at-arms, and taken up on the quarterdeck, followed by Mr\\nCulpepper and his steward.\\n\\nThere was no defence or excuse to be made: the pockets of his jacket and\\nof his trowsers were stuffed with raisins; and at the bottom of his\\npocket, when they were emptied by the master-at-arms, was found the\\nsquirt.\\n\\nAs soon as the hue and cry was over, and all the parties were on the\\nquarter-deck, as the coast was clear, I thought I might as well take\\nadvantage of it; and therefore I came out from my hiding-place, went\\ninto the steward\\'s room, filled my handkerchief with raisins, and\\nescaped to the berth unperceived; so that while Tommy Dott was\\ndisgorging on the quarter-deck, I was gorging below.\\n\\nMr Dott was reported to the captain for this heinous offence; and, in\\nconsequence, was ordered below under arrest, his place in the captain\\'s\\ngig being filled up by me; so that in every point of view Tommy\\nsuffered, and I reaped the harvest.  What pleased me most was, that,\\nbeing midshipman of the captain\\'s boat, I was of course continually in\\nthe company of the coxswain, Bob Cross.\\n\\nBut I must not delay at present, as I have to record a very serious\\nadventure which occurred, and by which I, for a long while, was\\nseparated from my companions and shipmates.\\n\\nIn ten days we sailed in search of a pirate vessel, which was reported\\nto have committed many dreadful excesses, and had become the terror of\\nthe mercantile navy.  Our orders were to proceed northward, and to\\ncruise off the Virgin Islands, near which she was said to have been last\\nseen.\\n\\nAbout three weeks after we had left Carlisle Bay, the look-out man\\nreported two strange sail from the mast-head.  I was sent up, as signal\\nmid, to examine them, and found that they were both schooners, hove to\\nclose together; one of them very rakish in their appearance.  All sail\\nin chase was made immediately, and we came up within three miles of\\nthem, when one, evidently the pirate we were in search of, made sail,\\nwhile the other remained hove to.\\n\\nAs we passed the vessel hove to, which we took it for granted was a\\nmerchantman, which the pirate had been plundering, the captain ordered\\none of the cutters to be lowered down with a midshipman and boat\\'s crew\\nto take possession of her.  The men were all in the boat, but the\\nmidshipman had gone down for his spy-glass, or something else, and as it\\nwas merely with a view of ascertaining what the vessel was, and the\\nchief object was to overtake the pirate vessel, to prevent the delay\\nwhich was caused by the other midshipman not being ready, Mr Hippesley\\nordered me to go into the boat instead of him, and, as soon as I was on\\nboard of the schooner, to make sail and follow the frigate.\\n\\nThe captain did say, \"He is too young, Mr Hippesley; is he not?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d sooner trust him than many older, sir,\" was the reply of the first\\nlieutenant.  \"Jump in, Mr Keene.\"  I did so, with my telescope in my\\nhand.  \"Lower away, my lads--unhook, and sheer off;\" and away went the\\nfrigate in pursuit of the pirate vessel, leaving me in the boat, to go\\non board of the schooner.\\n\\nWe were soon alongside, and found that there was not a soul on board of\\nthe vessel; what had become of the crew, whether they had been murdered,\\nor not, it was impossible to say, but there were a few drops of blood on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nThe vessel was an American, bound to one of the islands, with shingle\\nand fir planks; not only was her hold full, but the fir planks were\\npiled up on each side of the deck, between the masts, to the height of\\nfive or six feet.  The pirate had, apparently, been taking some of the\\nplanks on board for her own use.\\n\\nWe dropped the boat astern, let draw the foresheet, and made sail after\\nthe frigate, which was now more than a mile from us, and leaving us very\\nfast.\\n\\nThe schooner was so over-loaded that she sailed very badly, and before\\nthe evening closed in, we could just perceive the top-gallant sails of\\nthe Calliope above the horizon: but this we thought little of, as we\\nknew that as soon as she had captured the pirate she would run back\\nagain, and take us out.\\n\\nThere were some hams and other articles on board, for the pirates had\\nnot taken everything, although the lockers had been all broken open, and\\nthe articles were strewed about in every direction in the cabin and on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nJust before dark, we took the bearings of the frigate, and stood the\\nsame course as she was doing, and then we sat down to a plentiful meal\\nto which we did justice.  I then divided the boat\\'s crew into watches,\\nwent down into the cabin, and threw myself on the standing bed-place, of\\nwhich there was but one, with all my clothes on; the men who had not the\\nwatch went down, and turned in in the cuddy forward, where the seamen\\nusually sleep.\\n\\nIt was not till past midnight that I could obtain any sleep; the heat\\nwas excessive, and I was teased by the cockroaches, which appeared to\\nswarm in the cabin to an incredible degree, and were constantly running\\nover my face and body.  I little thought then why they swarmed.  I\\nrecollect that I dreamt of murder, and tossing men overboard; and then\\nof the vessel being on fire and after that, I felt very cool and\\ncomfortable, and I dreamed no more; I thought that I heard a voice\\ncalling my name: it appeared that I did hear it in my sleep, but I slept\\non.\\n\\nAt last I turned round, and felt a splashing as of water, and some water\\ncoming into my mouth: I awoke.  All was dark and quiet; I put my hand\\nout, and I put it into the water--where was I--was I overboard?  I\\njumped up in my fright; I found that was still on the standing\\nbed-place, but the water was above the mattress.\\n\\nI immediately comprehended that the vessel was sinking, and I called\\nout, but there was no reply.\\n\\nI turned out of the bed-place, and found myself up to my neck in water,\\nwith my feet on the cabin-deck.  Half swimming, and half floundering, I\\ngained the ladder, and went up the hatchway.\\n\\nIt was still quite dark, and I could not perceive nor hear anybody.  I\\ncalled out but there was no reply.  I then was certain that the men had\\nleft the vessel when they round her sinking, and had left me to sink\\nwith her.  I may as well here observe, that when the men had found the\\nwater rising upon them forward they had rushed on deck in a panic,\\ntelling the man at the wheel that the vessel was sinking, and had\\nimmediately hauled up the boat to save their lives; but they did\\nrecollect me, and the coxswain of the boat had come down in the cabin by\\nthe ladder, and called me: but the cabin was full of water, and he,\\nreceiving no answer, considered that I was drowned, and returned on\\ndeck.\\n\\nThe boat had then shoved off, and I was left to my fate; still I hoped\\nthat such was not the case, and I hallooed again and again, but in vain,\\nand I thought it was all over with me.  It was a dreadful position to be\\nin.  I said my prayers and prepared to die, and yet I thought it was\\nhard to die at fifteen years old.\\n\\nAlthough I do not consider that my prayers were of much efficacy, for\\nthere was but little resignation in them, praying had one good effect--\\nit composed me, and I began to think whether there was any chance of\\nbeing saved.\\n\\nYes, there were plenty of planks on the deck, and if it were daylight I\\ncould tie them together and make a raft, which would bear me up.  How I\\nlonged for daylight, for I was afraid that the vessel would sink before\\nI could see to do what was requisite.  The wind had become much fresher\\nduring the night, and the waves now dashed against the sides of the\\nwater-logged vessel.\\n\\nAs I watched for daylight, I began to reflect how this could have\\nhappened; and it occurred to me that the pirates had scuttled the bottom\\nof the vessel to sink her; and in this conjecture I was right.\\n\\nAt last a faint light appeared in the east, which soon broke into broad\\nday, and I lost no time in setting about my work.\\n\\nBefore I began, however, I thought it advisable to ascertain how much\\nmore water there was in the vessel since I had quitted the cabin which\\nit appeared to me must have been about two hours.  I therefore went down\\nin the cabin to measure it.  I know how high it was when I waded through\\nit.  I found, to my surprise, and, I may say, to my joy, that it was not\\nhigher than it was before.\\n\\nI thought that perhaps I might be mistaken, so I marked the height of\\nthe water at the cabin ladder, and I sat down on deck to watch it; it\\nappeared to me not to rise any higher.\\n\\nThis made me reflect, and it then struck me that, as the vessel was\\nladen with timber, she would not probably sink any lower, so I deferred\\nmy work till I had ascertained the fact.\\n\\nThree hours did I watch, and found that the water did not rise higher,\\nand I was satisfied; but the wind increased, and the vessel\\'s sails,\\ninstead of flapping to the wind as she drove without any one at the\\nhelm, were now bellied out, and the vessel careened to leeward.\\n\\nI was afraid that she would turn over; and finding an axe on the deck, I\\nmounted the rigging with it, and commenced cutting away the lacing of\\nthe sails from the mast.  I then lowered the gaffs, and cleared away the\\ncanvass in the same way, so that the sails fell on the deck.  This was a\\nwork of at least one hour; but when the canvass was off, the vessel was\\nsteady.\\n\\nIt was well that I had taken this precaution; for very soon afterwards\\nthe wind was much fresher, and the weather appeared very threatening;\\nthe sea also rose considerably.  I was very tired, and sat down for some\\ntime on the deck abaft.\\n\\nIt then occurred to me that the weight of the planks upon the deck must\\nnot only keep the vessel deeper in the water, but make her more\\ntop-heavy, and I determined to throw them overboard; but first I looked\\nfor something to eat, and found plenty of victuals in the iron pot in\\nwhich the men had cooked their supper the night before.\\n\\nAs soon as I had obtained from the cask lashed on the deck a drink of\\nwater, to wash down the cold fried ham which I had eaten, I set work to\\nthrow overboard the planks on deck.\\n\\nWhen I had thrown over a portion from one side I went to the other, and\\nthrew over as many more, that I might, as much as possible, keep the\\nvessel on an even keel.\\n\\nThis job occupied me the whole of the day; and when I had completed my\\ntask I examined the height of the water at the cabin ladder, and found\\nthat the vessel had risen more than six inches.  This was a source of\\ngreat comfort to me, and what pleased me more was, that the wind had\\ngone down again, and the water was much smoother.\\n\\nI made a supper off some raw ham, for the fire had been extinguished,\\nand committing myself to the protection of Heaven, lay down as the sun\\nset, and from the fatigue of the day was soon in a sound sleep.\\n\\nI awoke about the middle of the night.  The stars shone brightly, and\\nthere was but a slight ripple on the water.\\n\\nI thought of my mother, of my aunt Milly, of Captain Delmar, and I felt\\nfor the seal-skin pouch which was fastened round my neck.  It was all\\nsafe.\\n\\nI calculated chances, and I made up my mind that I should be picked up\\nby some vessel or another before long.\\n\\nI said to myself--\"Why, I am better off now than I was when in the\\nwherry, with Peggy Pearson; I was saved then, why should I not be now?\"\\n\\nI felt no desponding, and lay down, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nIt was broad daylight when I awoke; I took my spy-glass, and looking\\nround the horizon, discovered a vessel several miles off, standing\\ntowards me.  This gave me fresh spirits.\\n\\nI made a raw breakfast, and drank plenty of water as before.  The wind,\\nwhich was very light, increased a little.  The vessel came nearer, and I\\nmade her out to be a schooner.  In two hours she was close to me, and I\\nwaved my hat, and hallooed as loud as I could.\\n\\nThe schooner was full of men, and steered close to me--she was a\\nbeautiful craft, and, although the wind was so light, glided very fast\\nthrough the water, and I could not help thinking that she was the pirate\\nvessel which the frigate had been in chase of.\\n\\nIt appeared as if they intended to pass me, and I hallooed, \"Schooner,\\nahoy!  Why don\\'t you send a boat on board?\"\\n\\nI must say, that when the idea struck me that she was a pirate vessel,\\nmy heart almost failed me.\\n\\nShortly afterwards the schooner rounded to and lowered a boat, which\\npulled to the vessel.  The boat\\'s crew were all negroes.\\n\\nOne of them said, \"Jump in, you white boy; next jump he take be into the\\nshark\\'s mouth,\" continued the man, grinning, as he addressed himself to\\nthe others in the boat.\\n\\nI got into the boat, and they rowed on board the schooner.  I did then\\nthink that I was done for; for what mercy could I expect, being a king\\'s\\nofficer, from pirates, which the words of the negro convinced me they\\nwere?\\n\\nAs soon as I was alongside of the schooner, they ordered me to go up the\\nside, which I did, with my spy-glass in my hand.  I leaped from the\\ngunwale down on the deck, and found myself on board of an armed vessel,\\nwith a crew wholly composed of blacks.\\n\\nI was rudely seized by two of them, who led me aft to where a negro\\nstood apart from the rest.  A more fierce, severe, determined-looking\\ncountenance, I never beheld.  He was gigantic in stature and limbed like\\nthe Farnesian Hercules.\\n\\n\"Well, boy, who are you?\" said he, \"and how came you on board of that\\nvessel?\"\\n\\nI told him in very few words.\\n\\n\"Then you belong to that frigate that chased us the day before\\nyesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"What is her name?\"\\n\\n\"The Calliope.\"\\n\\n\"She sails well,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"she is the fastest sailer on this station.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all the information I want of you, boy: now you may go.\"\\n\\n\"Go where?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Go where?--go overboard, to be sure,\" replied he, with a grin.\\n\\nMy heart died within me; but I mustered courage enough to say, \"Much\\nobliged to you, sir; but I\\'d rather stay where I am, if it\\'s all the\\nsame to you.\"\\n\\nThe other negroes laughed at this reply, and I felt a little confidence;\\nat all events, their good-humour gave me courage, and I felt that being\\nbold was my only chance.\\n\\nThe negro captain looked at me for a time, as if considering, and at\\nlast said to the men, \"Overboard with him.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir, you\\'re very kind,\" said I; \"but this is a capital\\nspy-glass, and I leave it to you as a legacy.\"  And I went up to him and\\noffered him my spy-glass.  Merciful Heaven! bow my heart beat against my\\nribs when I did this!\\n\\nThe negro captain took the glass, and looked through it.\\n\\n\"It is a good glass,\" said he, as he removed it from his eyes.  It was\\npoor Green\\'s spy-glass, which he had given me for showing him the\\nmason\\'s signs.\\n\\n\"Well, white boy, I accept your present; and now, good bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir.  Do me one kindness in return,\" said I, very gravely,\\nfor I felt my hour was come.\\n\\n\"And what is that?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"Tie a shot to my heels, that I may sink quickly; it won\\'t take them\\nlong.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t ask me to spare your life, then?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"He de very first white dat not ask it,\" said one of the negroes.\\n\\n\"Dat really for true,\" said another.\\n\\n\"Yes, by gum,\" replied a third.\\n\\nOh, how I wished to know what to say at that moment!  The observations\\nof the negroes made me imagine that I had better not _ask_ for it and\\nyet how I clung to life!  It was an awful moment--I felt as if I had\\nlived a year in a few minutes.  For a second or two I felt faint and\\ngiddy--I drew a long breath and revived.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t answer me, boy,\" said the negro captain.\\n\\n\"Why should I ask when I feel certain to be refused?  If you will give\\nme my life, I will thank you: I don\\'t particularly wish to die, I can\\nassure you.\"\\n\\n\"I have taken an oath never to spare a white man.  For once I am sorry\\nthat I cannot break my oath.\"\\n\\n\"If that is all, I am a boy, and not a man,\" replied I.  \"Keep me till I\\ngrow bigger.\"\\n\\n\"By golly, captain, that very well said.  Keep him, captain,\" said one\\nof the negroes.\\n\\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied another; \"keep him to tend your cabin.  Proper\\nyou have white slave boy.\"\\n\\nThe negro captain for some time made no reply; he appeared to be in deep\\nthought.  At last he said--\\n\\n\"Boy, you have saved your life: you may thank yourself and not me.\\nProssa, let him be taken below; give him a frock and trousers and throw\\nthat infernal dress overboard, or I may change my resolution.\"\\n\\nThe negro who was addressed, and who wore a sort of uniform as an\\nofficer--which he was, being second mate--led me below,--nothing loth, I\\ncan assure my readers.\\n\\nWhen I was between decks.  I sat down upon a chest, my head swam, and I\\nfainted.  The shock had been too powerful for a lad of my age.  They\\nbrought water, and recovered me.  When I revived, I felt that I might\\nhave lost in their good opinion by thus knowing my weakness; and I had\\nsufficient presence of mind to ask for something to eat.  This deceived\\nthem; they said to one another that I must have been on board that\\nvessel for two days without food, and of course I did not deny it.\\n\\nThey brought me some meat and some grog.  I ate and drank a little.\\nThey then took off my uniform, and put on me a check frock and white\\ntrousers; after which, I said I wished to lie down a little, and they\\nleft me to sleep on the chest where I had been seated.\\n\\nI pretended to sleep, although I could not; and I found out by their\\nconversation that I gained the goodwill not only of the crew, but of the\\ncaptain, by my behaviour.\\n\\nI considered that I had gained my life, at least for the present; but\\nwhat security could I have in such company?\\n\\nAfter an hour or two I felt quite recovered, and I thought it advisable\\nto go on deck.  I did so, and went right aft to the negro captain, and\\nstood before him.\\n\\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, \"why do you come to me?\"\\n\\n\"You gave me my life; you\\'re the greatest friend I have here, so I come\\nto you.  Can I do anything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you may assist in the cabin, if your white blood does not curdle\\nat the idea of attending on a black man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I will do anything for them who are kind to me, as you\\nhave been.\"\\n\\n\"And think it no disgrace?\"\\n\\n\"Not the least.  Is it a disgrace to be grateful?\"\\n\\nThe reader will observe how particularly judicious my replies were,\\nalthough but fifteen years old.  My dangerous position had called forth\\nthe reflection and caution of manhood.\\n\\n\"Go down into the cabin; you may amuse yourself till I come.\"\\n\\nI obeyed this order.  The cabin was fitted up equal to most yachts, with\\nSpanish mahogany and gold mouldings; a beaufet full of silver (there was\\nno glass) occupied nearly one-half of it; even the plates and dishes\\nwere of the same material.  Silver candelabras hung down from the middle\\nof the beams; a variety of swords, pistols, and other weapons were fixed\\nup against the bulkhead; a small bookcase, chiefly of Spanish books,\\noccupied the after-bulkhead, and the portraits of several white females\\nfilled up the intervals; a large table in the centre, a stand full of\\ncharts, half a dozen boxes of cigars, and two most luxurious sofas,\\ncompleted the furniture.\\n\\nA door from the starboard side led, I presumed, to the stateroom, where\\nthe captain slept; but I did not venture to open it.\\n\\nI surveyed all this magnificence, wondering who this personage could be;\\nand more still, how it was that the whole of the crew were, as well as\\nthe captain, of the negro race.\\n\\nWe had heard that the pirate we were in search of was a well-known\\ncharacter--a Spaniard--who went by the name of Chico, and that his crew\\nconsisted of Americans, English, and Spaniards.  That this was the\\nvessel, I knew, from the conversation of the men when I was below for\\nthey called her the Stella.\\n\\nNow, it appeared that the vessel had changed masters; the crew were\\nchiefly Spanish negroes, or other negroes who spoke Spanish, but some of\\nthem spoke English, and a few words of Spanish; these, I presumed, were\\nAmerican or English runaways.  But the captain--his language was as\\ncorrect as my own; Spanish he spoke fluently, for I heard him giving\\norders in that language while I was in the cabin; neither was he\\nflat-nosed, like the majority.  Had he been white, his features would\\nhave been considered regular, although there was a fierceness about them\\nat times which was terrible to look at.\\n\\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"if I live and do well, I shall know more about it;\\nyes, if I live, I wish I was on the quarterdeck of the Calliope, even as\\nTommy was with his pockets stuffed full of the purser\\'s raisins, and\\nlooking like a fool and a rogue at the same time.\"\\n\\nI had been down in the cabin about half an hour, when the negro captain\\nmade his appearance.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose you would as soon see the devil as me--eh,\\nboy?\"\\n\\n\"No: indeed,\" replied I, laughing--for I had quite recovered my\\nconfidence--\"for you were about to send me to the devil, and I feel most\\nhappy that I still remain with you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re exactly the cut of boy I like,\" replied he, smiling.  \"How I\\nwish that you were black!--I detest your colour.\"\\n\\n\"I have no objection to black my face, if you wish it,\" replied I: \"it\\'s\\nall the same to me what colour I am.\"\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"I was fifteen a few months back.\"\\n\\n\"How long have you been to sea?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen months.\"\\n\\nHe then asked me a great many more questions, about the captain, the\\nofficers, the ship, and myself; to all of which I answered in a guarded\\nway.\\n\\nA negro brought down his supper; it was hot, and very savoury; without\\nany order on his part, I immediately attended upon him during his meal.\\nHe told the negro not to wait and conversed with me during the time that\\nhe was eating: at last, he told me how he had doubled the frigate during\\nthe night.  I then remarked that we had been informed that the vessel\\nwas called the Stella, that the captain\\'s name was Chico, and the crew\\nwere composed of white men of different nations.\\n\\n\"A month or two ago, it was the case,\" replied the captain.  \"Now I have\\ndone, and you may clear away,\" continued he, rising from his chair and\\nthrowing himself down on one of the sofas.  \"Stop; you are hungry, I\\ndon\\'t doubt; you can sit down and eat your supper, and remove the things\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\nI did as he told me: it was the first time in my life I had supped off\\nmassive plate--but I was in strange company; however, it did not spoil\\nmy appetite, and I did not forget to drink a goblet of wine by way of\\nwashing down my repast.\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said I, rising, and then performing my office of\\nattendant.\\n\\nAt his order, I rang the bell for the negro, who assisted me in clearing\\naway, and then went out with the remains of the supper.\\n\\n\"Am I to stay or go?\" said I, respectfully.\\n\\n\"You may go now.  Find the man who came in just now--Jose he is called;\\ntell him to give you something to sleep upon.\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Good-night, boy.\"\\n\\nAs I went forward looking for the negro servant, I was accosted more\\nthan once very kindly by the negro seamen.  At last I went up on the\\nforecastle, and they asked me to tell them how I was left on board the\\nschooner.  I did so to those who spoke English, and one of them, who\\ncould speak both languages, translated into Spanish for the benefit of\\nthe others.\\n\\n\"You be first white he hab spared, I tell you,\" said the American negro,\\nwho had translated into Spanish what I had told them, after the other\\nhad left me with him.\\n\\n\"The captain says he wishes I were black,\" said I to the negro; \"I wish\\nI was, too, while I am on board of this vessel--my colour makes him\\nangry, I see that.  Could not I be stained black?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do think it will be a very safe thing for you, if it could be;\\nfor you have not seen him sometimes in his moods; and if to-morrow\\nmorning he was chased and hard pressed by the frigate, you would stand a\\npoor chance, suppose his eyes light upon you.  I can\\'t tink what make\\nhim to let you off, only but cause you give him de spy-glass in dat hold\\nway.  I tink I know a chap on board who understand dat--I go see--you\\nwait here till I come back.\"\\n\\nThe negro left me, and in a few minutes returned, with a sort of\\nhalf-Indian, half-negro-looking cut of fellow, with whom he conversed in\\nSpanish.\\n\\n\"He say he know how to make brown like himself but not dark same as me.\\nSuppose you wish he do it to-night--begin now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do wish it,\" replied I; and so I did sincerely, for I felt that\\nit might be the saving of my life; and I had a great aversion to be torn\\nto pieces by the sharks which followed the vessel, that being anything\\nbut an agreeable mode of going out of the world.\\n\\nThe American black remained with me, and we conversed for about half an\\nhour, by which time we were joined by the Spanish Main negro, who\\nbrought up with him some decoction or another, boiling hot.  They\\nstripped me and rubbed me all over with a bit of sponge, not only the\\nface and hands, but every part of my body and then I was left standing\\nquite naked to dry; the crew had gathered round us, and were very merry\\nat the idea of changing my colour.\\n\\nAs soon as the warm air had dried me, the application was created; and\\nwhen I was again dry, the American told me to put on my clothes, and\\nthat he would call me early to have two more applications of the stuff,\\nand that then I should be quite dark enough.\\n\\nI asked for Jose, and told him what the captain had said; he gave me a\\nbundle of matting for a bed, and I was soon fast asleep.  About three\\no\\'clock in the morning I was called up, and the staining repeated twice,\\nand I then lay down again.\\n\\nWhen the hands were turned up at five bells (for everything was very\\nregular on board), Jose brought me a glass to look at myself, and I was\\nquite satisfied that my colour would no longer annoy the captain.  I was\\nnot as black as a negro, but I was as dark as a mulatto.\\n\\nI asked the Spanish negro, through Jose, who could speak both languages,\\nwhether I might wash myself?  He replied, all day long if I pleased;\\nthat I should not get the colour off; it would wear off in time, and the\\nstuff must be applied once a month, and that would be sufficient.\\n\\nI went to the forecastle, and washed myself; the negro crew were much\\namused, and said that I now was a \"bel muchaco\"--a handsome boy.  I dare\\nsay they thought so--at all events, they appeared to be very friendly\\nwith me, and my staining myself gave them great satisfaction.  I was\\nsitting with Jose between decks when the cabin bell rang.\\n\\n\"You go,\" said he, showing his white teeth as he grinned; \"I go after,\\nsee what captain tink.\"\\n\\nI went into the cabin, and knocked at the state-room door.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said the captain.\\n\\nI went in, and met him face to face.\\n\\n\"What!\" said he, looking earnestly at me--\"yet it must be--it is you, is\\nit not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, \"it is me.  I\\'ve turned dark to please you, and I\\nhope it does please you.\"\\n\\n\"It does, boy, I can look at you now, and forget that you are white.  I\\ncan.  I feel that I can love you now--you\\'ve got rid of your only fault\\nin my eyes, and I\\'m not sorry.  I\\'m only glad that I did not--\"\\n\\n\"Give me to the sharks,\" said I, finishing his sentence.\\n\\n\"Exactly so; say no more about it.\"\\n\\nI immediately turned the conversation, by asking him what he required;\\nand I attended him while dressing.  From that time he became very\\nfriendly towards me, constantly conversing with me.  I did my duty as\\nhis servant for more than a fortnight, during which time we became very\\nintimate, and (I may as well confess it) I grew very fond of my new\\nmaster, and thought less about the ship and my shipmates.  We were going\\ninto a port, I knew, but what port I did not know.\\n\\nI often had conversations with Jose and the American black, and gained a\\ngreat deal of information from them; but I could not discover much of\\nthe history of the captain.  On that point they refused to be\\ncommunicative; occasionally hints were given, and then, as if\\nrecollecting themselves, they stopped speaking.\\n\\nIt was about three weeks before we made the land of Cuba, and as soon as\\nwe did so, the schooner was hove to till night, when sail was again\\nmade, and before ten o\\'clock we saw the lights of the Havannah.  When\\nabout three miles off we again hove to, and about midnight we perceived\\nunder the land the white sails of a schooner, which was standing out.\\nSail was made, and we ran down to her, and before she was aware that we\\nwere an enemy, she was laid by the board and in the possession of our\\ncrew.  The people belonging to the vessel were handed up, and she was\\nexamined.  She proved to be a vessel fitted out for the slave trade,\\nwith the manacles, etcetera, on board of her, and was just sailing for\\nthe coast.\\n\\nI was on the deck when the white men, belonging to the slaver, were\\nbrought on board, and never shall I forget the rage and fury of the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nAll sail was made upon both schooners, standing right off from the land,\\nand at daylight we had left it a long way astern.\\n\\nJose said to me, \"You better not go to captain dis day.  Keep out of his\\nway--perhaps he recollect dat you white.\"\\n\\nFrom what I had seen the night before, I thought this good advice; and I\\nnot only did not go into the cabin, but I did not show myself on deck.\\n\\nAbout eight o\\'clock in the morning I heard the boat lowered down and\\norders given to scuttle the vessel, as soon as she had been well\\nsearched.  This was done, and the boat returned, having found several\\nthousand dollars on board of her, which they handed upon deck.\\n\\nI remained below: I heard the angry voice of the negro captain--the\\npleadings and beggings for mercy of the prisoners--busy preparations\\nmaking on deck; and several men came down and handed up buckets of sand;\\nan iron grating was handed up.  The countenances of the negroes who were\\nthus employed appeared inflamed, as if their wrath was excited; now and\\nthen they laughed at each other, and looked more like demons than men.\\nThat some dreadful punishment was about to be inflicted I was certain\\nand I remained crouched behind the foremast on the lower-deck.\\n\\nAt last the men were all on deck again, and I was left alone; and then I\\nheard more noise, begging for mercy, weeping and wailing, and\\noccasionally a few words from the mouth of the negro captain; then rose\\nshrieks and screams, and appeals to Heaven, and a strong smell, which I\\ncould not comprehend, came down the hatchways.\\n\\nThe shrieks grew fainter, and at last ceased, and something was thrown\\noverboard.  Then the same tragedy, whatever it was, was acted over\\nagain--more attempts to obtain mercy--more shrieks--again the same\\noverpowering smell.  What could it be?  I would have given much to know,\\nbut something told me that I must remain where I was.  Ten times was\\nthis repeated, and then, as evening came on, there was a bustle on deck,\\nand after a time the crew descended the hatchways.\\n\\nI caught the eye of the American, with whom I was intimate, and as he\\npassed me, I beckoned to him.  He came to me.\\n\\n\"What has been done?\" said I in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Captain punish slave traders,\" replied he; \"always punish them so.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what did he do to them?\"\\n\\n\"Do?--roast \\'em alive.  Dis third slave vessel he take, and he always\\nserve \\'em so.  Serve \\'em right; captain very savage; no go to him till\\nmorrow morning--you keep close.\"  So saying, the American negro left me.\\n\\nAs I afterwards found out, the long boat on the booms had been cleared\\nout, the sand laid at the bottom to prevent the fire from burning the\\nboat, the captain and crew of the slave vessel laid on one after the\\nother upon the iron grating, and burnt alive.  This accounted for the\\nhorrible smell that had come down the hatchways.\\n\\nIt may be considered strange that I really did not feel so much horror\\nas perhaps I ought to have done.  Had this dreadful punishment been\\ninflicted upon any _other_ persons than slave dealers, and _by_ any\\nother parties than negroes, I should not have been able to look at the\\ncaptain without abhorrence expressed in my countenance; but I know well\\nthe horrors of the slave trade from conversation I had had with Bob\\nCross; and I had imbibed such a hatred against the parties who had\\ncarried it on, that it appeared to me to be an act of retaliation almost\\nallied to justice.  Had the negro captain only warred against slave\\ndealers, I do not think I should have cared about remaining in the\\nvessel; but he had told me and fully proved to me, that he detested all\\nwhite men, and had never spared them except in my own instance.\\n\\nI must acknowledge that I felt very much like going into the lion\\'s den,\\nwhen the next morning, on his ringing the cabin bell, I presented myself\\nto the captain; but so far from being in an ill-humour, he was very kind\\nto me.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, as I was going out, he said to me, \"You must have a\\nname: I shall call you Cato--recollect that; and now I have a question\\nto ask you--What is that which you carry round your neck on a ribbon?\"\\n\\n\"A letter, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"A letter! and why do you carry a letter?\"\\n\\n\"Because it is of the greatest importance to me.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Now, Cato, sit down on the other sofa, and let me know your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\nI felt that I could not do better than to make this man at once my\\nconfidant.  He might take a strong interest in me, and it was not likely\\nto go farther.  I therefore told him everything connected with my birth\\nand parentage, what my suspicions had been, and how the letter had\\nconfirmed them.  I unsewed the seal-skin, and gave him the letter to\\nread--without being aware that he could read: he took it and read it\\naloud.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"that\\'s proof under his own hand; and now, Cato, never\\nbe afraid of me, for, however I may wreak my vengeance upon others, I\\nswear _by my colour_ that I never will hurt you, or permit others to do\\nso.  I am a tiger--I know it; but you have often seen a little spaniel\\ncaressed by the tiger, whose fangs are turned against every other living\\nthing.  You are quite safe.\"\\n\\n\"I feel I am, since you say so,\" replied I; \"and since I am to be your\\npet, I shall take liberties, and ask you, in return, to tell me your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad that you have asked it, as I wish you to know it.  I will\\nbegin at once--\\n\\n\"I was born in America, in the state of Pennsylvania, of free parents.\\nMy father was a sail-maker, and was worth money; bet a free black in\\nAmerica is even worse treated and more despised than a slave.  I had two\\nbrothers, who went to school with me.\\n\\n\"My father intended to bring me up for the Church.  You look astonished;\\nbut in the States we have clergymen of our colour, as well as white\\nones; looked down upon and despised, I grant, although they do teach the\\nWord of God; but I was very unfit for that profession, as you may\\nsuppose.  I was very proud and haughty; I felt that I was as good as a\\nwhite man, and I very often got into scrapes from my resenting injuries.\\n\\n\"However, my education went on successfully, much more so than that of\\nmy brothers, who could not learn.  I could, and learnt rapidly but I\\nlearnt to hate and detest white men, and more especially Americans; I\\nbrooded over the injuries of people of colour, as we were called, and\\nall my father\\'s advice and entreaty could not persuade me to keep my\\nthoughts to myself.  As I grew up to manhood, I spoke boldly, and more\\nthan once nearly lost my life for so doing; for most Americans think no\\nmore of taking the life of one like me than of a dog in the street.\\nMore than one knife has been directed to my heart, and more than once\\nwas I then up before the judge, and sentenced to imprisonment for no\\nfault; my evidence, and the evidence of those of my colour, not being\\npermitted to be received in a court of justice.  Any white villain had\\nonly to swear falsely--and there is no want of that class in America--\\nand there was no appeal.  At last I was sentenced to be whipped; then my\\nblood boiled, and I vowed a vengeance which I have fearfully adhered\\nto.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wonder at that,\" said I; \"I would have done the same.\"\\n\\n\"The man who had sworn falsely against me in this last instance had come\\nup from the South; I obtained what money I could from my father, and\\nwent away in pursuit of him.  I found him--dogged him, and one evening I\\naccosted him, and plunged my bowie-knife into his heart.  I fled that\\nState, and crossed the Mississippi.\\n\\n\"I had not been long in Arkansas before a man--a cotton-grower, who\\nowned about a hundred and fifty slaves--inquired who I was, and whether\\nI had a pass; I replied that I was a free man, born in Pennsylvania, and\\nwas there on my own affairs.  The next day I was taken up, brought\\nbefore the magistrate, and this scoundrel swore that I was his slave,\\nand had absconded from him ten years before.\\n\\n\"My defence--the proof which I offered to bring, was not listened to.  I\\nwas made over to him, and the rascal grinned as the constables brought\\nme away with him.  His plantation was at the Red River.  It was\\ndifficult to escape and indeed, almost useless to attempt it: but the\\nfact was, that I did not wish to do so; I remained to have my revenge.\\nI tried to make the other slaves rise against him, but they were too\\ncowed; they even informed against me, and I was tied down, and flogged\\nby the drivers until the flesh fell from my shoulders.\\n\\n\"As soon as I recovered, I determined to do--or die.  I heard that there\\nwere some pirate vessels in the Barataria lagoons on the other side of\\nNew Orleans; I resolved to join the crews, but first to have my revenge.\\nI did so: I set fire to the plantation house--struck the scoundrel who\\nhad made me a slave senseless as he attempted to escape, and threw his\\nbody into the flames; I then made the door fast, and fled.  I was met by\\none of the overseers, who was armed, and who would have stopped me: I\\nbeat his brains out with his own musket, and then gained the woods.  You\\nsee that I am powerful; you hardly know how much so.  After several\\ndays\\' travelling, I arrived at the lagoons.  I found this very vessel at\\nanchor.  I offered myself, and they accepted me immediately.\\n\\n\"There were several of my colour on board--runaway slaves--and all good\\ndetermined men.  These were the people I required, for they understood\\nme.  Even on board of a pirate vessel, the same contempt was shown\\ntowards us--still considered as inferior beings.  All the heavy work all\\nthe dirty work, was for the negro race; and we often worked like slaves,\\nwhile the captain and the rest of the crew caroused.  I was three years\\non board of this vessel.  Our rendezvous where we are going to now, is a\\nsmall land-locked bay on the island of Cuba.  No vessel in it can be\\nseen from seaward, and there is but one narrow pass by which it\\ncommunicates with the interior, and it is far from any habitation.  A\\nbetter retreat for a pirate vessel could not well be found.  We used\\nvery often to go in to refit, and take in provisions and water; for in a\\ncave there, we keep the provisions which we take from other vessels.\\n\\n\"In a desperate fight which we had with an English man-of-war brig, we\\nlost nearly forty of our men.  The captain, Chico, as he was called, was\\nobliged to fill up with black men, until he could procure others.  The\\nconsequence was, that with the ten before on board, there were fifty\\nblacks to seventy whites.  It was then that I made up my mind that I\\nwould retaliate for all that my race had suffered.  I was sure of the\\nten with whom I had sailed so long; I sounded the others, and found them\\nall willing.\\n\\n\"We sailed from the Mexican Gulf, and made for the Rendezvous Bay, in\\nCuba.  As soon as we arrived, of course, as with all pirate vessels, the\\nfirst day was dedicated to revelling and intoxication--that is, by the\\nwhite portion of the crew.  We negroes were employed in getting the\\ncasks ashore for water.  That very night, when they all lay asleep and\\ndrunk, we put every soul of them to death, and the Stella belonged to me\\nand my brave black who chose me for their captain, and swore by their\\nwrongs eternal enmity to the European race.\\n\\n\"As you may suppose, I was short-manned; but we soon found plenty of\\nmen, and have now as fine a crew as ever trod a deck.\"\\n\\n\"How long is it since you took possession of the vessel?\"\\n\\n\"About eight or nine months, during which time I have spared none except\\nyou.  The usual death is drowning; but if I fall in with a slaver,\\nthen--you know what took place yesterday.\"\\n\\nI was silent for a time.  \"I do not wonder,\" said I, at last, \"at your\\nhatred of the whites, especially of the Americans.  As for your wreaking\\nyour vengeance upon those employed in the slave trade, dreadful as it\\nis, I scarcely pity them; but in your general warfare against the\\nwhites, recollect that you may murder those who are your friends, and\\nwho have done all they can to put an end to slavery.  Even in America,\\nthere are many who are opposed to it.\"\\n\\n\"It is impossible to make a distinction,\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I, musing.\\n\\n\"Why do you ask?  You may as well know; I wish it to be known: it is\\nJames Vincent.\"\\n\\n\"But tell me, if you were to meet with a very superior force, what would\\nyou do?\"\\n\\n\"Run if I could; if not, fight.\"\\n\\n\"But you might be captured, and then--\"\\n\\n\"Never, boy; never.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"as you have begun by sparing me, I hope you will spare\\nothers now.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why I spared you.  Had you shown any fear of death I\\nshould not have done so; but I felt that you would not care about it.  I\\nbelieve it was that.\"\\n\\nAbout ten days after, we made the east end of the island of Cuba, and\\nran into the Bay of Rendezvous, as it was named by the pirate.  It was\\nvery small, but completely land-locked, and the land so high on every\\nside that the masts of the vessel could not be seen from the seaward.\\nThe bay on the land side was met by a deep, narrow ravine, between\\nmountains which were almost perpendicular, the ravine itself being\\naccessible from the main land by only one narrow path known to the\\npirates, and which they seldom made use of, except when a spy was sent\\nto the Havannah to ascertain what vessels were about to sail.\\n\\nOn the high land which shut in the bay from the sea, the pirates had a\\nman constantly on the look-out, to report any vessel which might be in\\nthe offing, and Vincent himself passed much of his time there, as the\\nbreeze was fresh and the air cool to what it was down in the land-locked\\nbay.  I was, for the same reason, very fond of being on the look-out\\nhill, and generally followed up the captain when he went out there.  He\\ncertainly now showed a strong affection for me, and I liked him better\\nthan I ever thought I could have done.  He was constantly telling me of\\nthe treatment he and the other poor blacks had received in America, and\\nI could not help feeling my blood boil, and a conviction that, had I\\nbeen so treated, I should probably have been equally under the influence\\nof revenge.  It is the world, and the treatment we receive from it,\\nwhich makes us chiefly what we are.\\n\\nOne day the captain told me he was going that evening to obtain\\ninformation, as the spy he had sent had returned unsuccessful, and that\\nhe should be absent for three or four days.\\n\\nAlthough I was not discontented with my position, still, as the reader\\nmay well suppose, I had a strong wish to be out of it as soon as\\npossible, and I had determined to escape if I could; it immediately\\noccurred to me, that his absence would give me the opportunity.\\n\\nI replied with a laugh, \"Had you not better take me with you?\"\\n\\n\"Very likely, indeed, you would be so very useful; I shall have quite\\nenough to do to take care of myself; besides, you might betray me,\"\\nadded he, with a fierce and penetrating look.\\n\\n\"Thank you, for your good opinion,\" replied I, indignantly.  \"So you\\nthink, because you have saved my life, that I would take yours.  I am\\nnot yet such a rascal, whatever I may become by keeping bad company.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" replied the negro captain, \"I believe I am wrong, so don\\'t\\nget into a passion; but, at all events, you must see that it is\\nimpossible I can take you with me.\"\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t choose, I can\\'t help it,\" said I; \"but I don\\'t like\\nremaining here without you; I shall run away if I can, so I give you\\nfair warning.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t find that quite so easy,\" replied he, laughing; \"and I\\nrecommend you not to attempt it.\"\\n\\nHere the conversation dropped.  About midnight the captain commenced his\\nascent of the ravine, and I resolved that I would not lose the\\nopportunity, if it offered, of following him.  I watched him as long as\\nI could see him, that I might know the direction of the secret path, and\\nthen I joined the crew, who were lying down by the tents which they had\\npitched on the shore.  Shortly afterwards, the Spanish Indian, who had\\ncoloured me, passed by me, and, as I intended to make the attempt before\\nit was quite dark, I thought that I would remove any suspicion, and I\\ntherefore requested him to stain me again.  This he consented to do, and\\nin half an hour I was again naked among the negroes and undergoing the\\noperation.  Having received the two applications, as before, I then\\nquitted them.\\n\\nAs soon as it was quite dark, I armed myself with a pair of pistols, and\\ncrawled underneath the back of the captain\\'s tent, in which I always\\nslept, and, without being perceived, gained the narrow path in the\\nbrushwood by which the captain had left.\\n\\nI continued in the path for some time, by feeling the brushwood on\\neither side; but before I had crawled half way up the ravine, I found\\nthat the brushwood had not been cut away any farther and I was at a loss\\nhow to proceed.  All traces were gone, and all I had to do was to climb\\nup to the summit, and to take my chance of finding any egress.  I toiled\\non with difficulty, sometimes stopped by a rock which would take me\\nminutes to climb over at others, holding on by the brushwood for my\\nlife.  By twelve o\\'clock I had gained more than two-thirds of the\\nascent, and then the moon rose, and assisted me with her light.  I must\\nsay, that when I looked up and saw the rocks towering above me, and\\noverhanging my path, I felt that escape was nearly impossible: however,\\nI recommenced my labour, and gained some ground, when, as I was clinging\\nto the side of a rock by a small shrub, it gave way, and I rolled and\\nfell down many feet, between that rock and another opposite to it.\\n\\nI was not much hurt, and I regained my legs.  Looking up and about me, I\\nfound that I was in a narrow passage, between the rocks, leading both up\\nand down--in fact, I had tumbled into the secret path that I had been in\\nsearch of.  Delighted with this discovery, I now set off with great\\nspirit, and in half an hour found myself on the other side of the lull\\nwhich formed the ravine, and looking down upon an expanse of country in\\nthe interior.  Being very tired, I sat down, that I might recover my\\nstrength before I continued my journey.\\n\\n\"I am free at last,\" thought I, and my memory wandered back to my mother\\nmy ship, and my captain--old Culpepper, Tommy Dott, and Bob Cross.  \"I\\nshall see them all,\" I thought, \"and what a story I shall have to tell.\"\\nAs soon as I had rested myself and recovered my breath, I thought I\\nmight as well start.\\n\\nI had not proceeded more than a hundred yards before I thought heard a\\nnoise, as if some one was approaching.  I listened--I felt sure that\\nsuch was the case, and I also heard the deep baying of a hound.  The\\nnoise increased rapidly--it was that of one forcing his way through the\\nbrushwood, which covered the side of the hill.\\n\\nIn a minute afterwards I perceived a man coming up the hill at a swift\\npace, directly towards me.  As he approached I could almost swear that\\nit was Vincent, the negro captain; but when within ten yards of me, I\\nperceived, him turn round and flourish his sabre in the air, while, at\\nthe same time, three large bloodhounds sprang at him.  One fell by the\\nblow of his sabre, but the other two flew at his throat, and fastened on\\nhim, tearing him to the around, and holding him in spite of all his\\nstruggling and his immense strength.\\n\\nI recollected my pistols: I cocked them, ran up, and putting one to the\\nhead of the nearest dog, blew out its brains.  I was equally successful\\nwith the other--they both lay dead by his side, and Vincent was\\nreleased.  He started up.\\n\\n\"It is me, Cato,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Cato!\" replied he; \"but there is not a moment to be lost.  I understand\\nit all.\"\\n\\nHe seized me by the arm, and dragged me with him to the narrow entrance\\nof the pass, and as soon as we came in he rolled three large rocks,\\nwhich had evidently been used for such purpose before, so as completely\\nto block up the entrance.\\n\\n\"There,\" said he, leaning back quite exhausted; \"be quiet, Cato.  We are\\nsafe now; they will be on the top of the hill directly.\"\\n\\nWe remained where we were about ten minutes, when we heard voices not\\nvery far from us.  They were the pursuers of the negro captain who were\\nevidently baffled.  After a time the sounds receded from us, and we\\nheard them no more.  Vincent then spoke:--\\n\\n\"You were escaping, Cato.\"\\n\\n\"I had escaped,\" replied I: \"I told you that I would.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that you should have discovered the path; did any one betray it\\nto you?\"\\n\\n\"No one,\" replied I: and I then told him how I had fallen into it.\\n\\n\"Well you have returned all obligations, and more than ever you owed\\nme,\" said he: \"you have saved my life this time, and that when all\\nchance was over.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" replied I, \"although I shall be very sorry to part with you,\\ngive me that liberty which I had gained, and which I lost in defending\\nyou from the dogs.\"\\n\\n\"I would have let you go then, Cato,\" replied he, \"but your life would\\nhave been sacrificed.  My pursuers would have hurried you to prison\\nbefore you could have explained who you were.  You forget your colour is\\nchanged; they were not seeking me, but a runaway slave, and the\\nbloodhounds came upon my track.  Those white men show no mercy; they\\nhave more pleasure in seeing a runaway slave torn to pieces by those\\ndogs than in recovering possession of him.  It is a sort of fox-chase to\\nthem,\" continued he, grating his teeth after he had said so.  \"Cato, I\\nwill give you your liberty, if you wish it, and I know you do wish it,\\nas soon as I can with any prudence; that I promise you, and you know\\nthat I will keep my word.\"\\n\\n\"I am quite satisfied,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"And do you promise me that you will not attempt to escape a second\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\"I promise you that I will not,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" said Vincent.  \"Now let us go down the hill, for I am very\\nmuch torn by those infernal brutes, and must have the wounds washed and\\nattended to.\"\\n\\nWe descended the hill, in silence, and in a quarter of an hour had\\ngained the tent.  Vincent was severely bitten and torn: as soon as his\\nwounds had been dressed he lay down on his mat, and I did the same.\\n\\nIt was some days before Vincent recovered from the severe injuries which\\nhe had received from the bloodhounds; and he did not appear to be\\ninclined to run any more risks of that sort.  Although he said little, I\\ncould perceive that he was brooding over future vengeance and he was now\\nnearly the whole of the day with his glass on the look-out hill.\\n\\nOne morning a schooner hove in sight, steering from the Havannah to the\\nsouthward and eastward, either for the islands of the Spanish Main.  The\\nStella had for many days been ready for instant sailing, and having\\nwatched her till near sunset, Vincent sent down orders for every soul to\\nbe on board, and the anchor hove up.  Just as it was dark we towed out\\nof the bay, and made all sail.\\n\\nAt daylight the schooner was but a few miles ahead of us and not being a\\nfast sailer, in little more than an flour we were alongside of her.  She\\nproved to be bound to the island of Curacao, being the property of an\\nold Dutch gentleman, who was on board with his daughter, a little girl\\nabout seven years old.  The crew consisted chiefly of negroes, slaves to\\nthe owner; the master of the vessel and the mate being, with the\\nexception of the old gentleman and the little girl, the only white\\npeople on board.\\n\\nAs usual, the crew were brought on board by the pirates, who reported to\\nthe captain that the vessel was in ballast, and of no value.  As the\\ncrew of the Stella were already more than requisite, Vincent did not\\nrequire the negroes; he told them that they might go on board the\\nschooner again, and take her into any port they pleased; with the white\\npeople, however it was another affair.\\n\\nI had remained below, not wishing to witness a scene of butchery; but I\\nwas induced to look up the ladder, in consequence of Jose telling me\\nthat there was a little white girl come on board.  At the time that I\\ndid so, Vincent had just done speaking with the negroes belonging to the\\ncaptured vessel; they had fallen back, and there was then standing\\nbefore Vincent, the master and mate of the vessel, the old Dutch\\ngentleman, and the little girl.\\n\\nA more interesting child I never had seen, and my heart bled at the idea\\nof her being sacrificed.  I could not help hoping that Vincent would\\nhave a similar feeling, but I was mistaken.  The master and mate were\\npointed at, and immediately seized by negroes and tossed over into the\\nsea.  The old gentleman bowed his head over the beautiful child, and she\\nknelt to him, as if for his blessing before she died.  At that very\\nmoment Vincent gave the sign--I could remain quiet to longer--I sprang\\non the deck.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried I to the men who were about to seize the old\\ngentleman--\"stop!\"  The negroes did fall back at my voice.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Vincent.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" cried I, \"do you call yourself a man, to war with\\nchildren and old grey-headed men?  You must not, shall not, touch these\\ntwo.  You have wreaked your vengeance upon the white men; be content--\\nlet these go.\"\\n\\n\"Cato,\" replied Vincent, fiercely, \"it is well that it is you that have\\ndared to snatch the prey from the fangs of the wild beast.  Had it been\\nanother, this pistol should have sent a ball whizzing through his brain;\\nas it is, go down below immediately.\"\\n\\n\"I do not fear your pistol, Captain Vincent, nor will I go below; that\\nvery pistol, in my hand, saved you from the fangs of the blood-hound.  I\\ntell you, therefore, that you must not destroy that innocent child--if\\nyou love me, you must not; for I will hate, detest, and scorn you ever\\nafterwards.  I entreat you--I implore you to let them go: they are not\\nfit objects for your vengeance; and if you destroy them, I tell you, you\\nare a coward.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" roared the tiger, \"a coward!\" and, no longer able to contain\\nhimself he levelled his pistol at me and drew the trigger.  It missed\\nfire; Vincent looked very confused--he tossed the pistol on deck, folded\\nhis arms and turned his face away.\\n\\nThere was a dead silence.  The negro crew looked first at me and then at\\nthe captain, as if awaiting orders, and uncertain of the issue.  The\\nDutch gentleman seemed to be so lost in surprise, as to almost forget\\nhis impending fate; while the little girl clung to him and stared at me\\nwith her deep blue eyes.  It was what on the theatres they would call a\\ntableau.\\n\\nI followed up my advantage.  Stepping forward, and placing myself before\\nthe old man and the child, I first broke the silence.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" said I, \"you did once promise me that you would never\\ninjure me or attempt my life; that promise you have broken.  Since that,\\nyou have made me another promise--you may recollect it--which was, that\\nyou would allow me to leave you on the first favourable opportunity;\\nthere cannot be any opportunity more favourable than the present.  The\\nnegroes whom you are to send back to the schooner do not know how to\\nnavigate her.  I request, therefore, to know whether you intend to keep\\nthis second promise, or to break it as you have the first?  I ask my\\nliberty.\"\\n\\n\"If I broke my promise just now, it was your fault,\" replied Vincent,\\ncoolly.  \"I am sorry for it, and I can say no more; I intended to keep\\nit, and, to prove so, I now keep my second--you may go.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for that.  I only wish that, now I leave you, I could leave\\nyou with feelings of good-will and not of--I must say it--of horror and\\ndisgust.  Captain Vincent, once more let me beg, as a last favour, that\\nyou will spare these poor people.\"\\n\\n\"Since you are so particularly interested about this useless old man and\\nstill more useless child,\" replied Vincent, sarcastically, \"I will now\\nmake a proposal to you.  You have your liberty.  Do you choose to give\\nit up and remain here, provided I let them go away in the schooner?\\nCome now--take your choice; for I swear by my colour, that if you go\\naway in the schooner, the moment you shove off, they shall go over the\\ngunwale.\"\\n\\n\"My choice is then made,\" replied I; for I knew that when he swore by\\nhis colour he was in earnest: \"release them, and I will remain here.\"  I\\nlittle knew what I was to undergo in consequence of this decision.\\n\\n\"Be it so,\" said Vincent: then turning to one of the mates, \"let them go\\nback with the negroes; hoist the boat up when she returns, and sail for\\nthe Rendezvous.\"  So saying, he went down into the cabin.\\n\\n\"You are saved,\" said I, going up to the old Dutch gentleman; \"lose no\\ntime; get into the boat as fast as possible, and make sail on your\\nvessel as soon as you get on board.  Good bye, little girl,\" said I,\\ntaking her hand.\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" replied the gentleman in good English--\"I cannot say how\\nmuch; I am so surprised at what I have seen but recollect the name of\\nVanderwelt, of Curacao; and if ever we meet again, you will find me\\ngrateful.\"\\n\\n\"I will; but ask no more questions now--into the boat--quick,\" said I,\\nshaking his proffered hand.  They were handed down into the boat by the\\nnegroes.\\n\\nI remained on deck until they were put on board; the boat returned, was\\nhoisted up, the schooner made sail again, and then I went down into the\\ncabin.  I found the negro captain stretched upon the sofa, his face\\ncovered up with both his hands; he remained in the same position, taking\\nno notice of my coming down.  Although my confidence in him was\\ndestroyed after his snapping the pistol at me, yet when I reflected how\\nI had bearded him in his rage, I did make some excuse for him; moreover,\\nI knew that it was my interest to be on the best terms with him, and, if\\npossible, make him forget what had passed, for I felt that his proud\\nspirit would make it difficult for him to forgive himself for having\\nbeen induced by his passion to break an oath which he had sworn to by\\nhis colour; I therefore, after a little reflection, went up to him and\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"I am sorry that I made you so angry, Captain Vincent; you must forgive\\nme, but I thought that deed beneath you, and I could not bear to have a\\nbad opinion of you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to assert that you have not a bad opinion of me now?\"\\nreplied he, fixing his eyes upon me.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; you have released those I pleaded for, and I am very\\ngrateful to you for having done so.\"\\n\\n\"You have made me do what I never did before,\" replied he, raising\\nhimself and sitting with his feet on the deck.\\n\\n\"I know I have; I have made you spare those of my colour.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean that; you have irritated me so as to make me break my\\noath.\"\\n\\n\"That was my own doing--my fault rather than yours.  I had no right to\\nspeak as I did; but I was in a great rage, and that is the truth.  I do\\nbelieve that, if I had had a pistol in my hand, I should have fired it\\nat you; so we may cry quits on that score.\"\\n\\n\"I am angry with myself--the more so, that I little imagined that you\\nwould have remained with me after my breaking my oath.  Either you must\\nhave felt great interest about those people, or you must have great\\nconfidence in me, a confidence winch I have proved that I do not\\ndeserve.\"\\n\\n\"That you did forget yourself, I grant; but I have that confidence that\\nit will be a warning to you, and you will not forget yourself again; I\\ntherefore remain with you with perfect confidence, feeling I am quite\\nsafe, until you think proper to give me my liberty.\"\\n\\n\"You will wish to leave me then?\"\\n\\n\"I have relations and friends--a profession to follow.  What can I gain\\nby remaining here, except your friendship?  I never will be a pirate,\\nyou may be assured, I wish from my heart that you were not one.\"\\n\\n\"And who should be pirates if the blacks are not?\" replied Vincent.\\n\"Have they not the curse of Cain?  Are they not branded?  Ought not\\ntheir hands to be against every one but their own race?  What is the\\nArab but the pirate of the desert--the sea of sand?  Black is the colour\\nfor pirates.  Even the white pirates feel the truth of this, or why do\\nthey hoist the _black_ flag?\"\\n\\n\"At all events, it\\'s a profession that seldom ends well.\"\\n\\n\"And what matter does that make?  We can die but once--I care not how\\nsoon.  I have not found life so very sweet as to care for it, I assure\\nyou.  Cato, there is but one thing sweet in existence--one feeling that\\nnever clogs and never tires, and that is revenge.\"\\n\\n\"Are not love and friendship sweet?  I certainly know nothing about the\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"I know no more than you do of it.  They say friendship is the more\\nlasting; and as a proof of how lasting that is I snapped my pistol at\\nyou, and, had it not missed fire, should have killed the only one for\\nwhom I ever felt friendship in this world.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bad habit you have of carrying your pistols at all times; they\\nare too handy, and give no time or reflection.  Only suppose, now, you\\nhad blown out my brains, you would have been very sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Cato, I have many lives on my hands, and hope to have many more before\\nI die.  I never have repented one act of my life--a murder, as you may\\ncall it--and I never shall.  But I tell you frankly, that had I\\ndestroyed you in my passion I should have been a miserable man.  I know\\nit; I feel it.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s say no more about it: that I\\'m just as glad as you are that you\\ndid not kill me, I assure you most positively.  Here\\'s Jose coming with\\nthe dinner.\"\\n\\nHere ended our conversation, which I have given just to show the\\npeculiar disposition of this extraordinary man, with whom I had become\\ndomesticated.  Verily and truly was I, as he said, \"like a little dog in\\nthe cage of a tiger,\" and, from familiarity: just as bold as dogs become\\nunder such peculiar circumstances.\\n\\nBefore morning we were again at anchor in the Rendezvous Bay, and the\\ntents were pitched as before.  We remained there for more than a\\nfortnight, during which my intimacy with the captain was even greater\\nthan before.  He appeared to endeavour to do all in his power to restore\\nmy confidence in him, and he succeeded.  Still, I must say, that I began\\nto be weary of this sort of life.  My dreams were ever of murder and\\nbloodshed; and more than once I felt inclined to make my escape: but I\\nhad promised, and the remembrance of my promise prevented me.\\n\\nOne afternoon the man on the look-out made the usual signal for a vessel\\nin sight.  Vincent went up immediately, and I followed him.  It was a\\nschooner, very long, with very taut, raking masts.  Vincent examined her\\nfor some time, and then gave me the glass, and asked me what I thought\\nof her.  I replied, that I thought she was a man-of-war schooner.\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said he, \"I know her well; it is the Arrow, and she has\\ncome out to cruise for me.  This is the third time that she has been\\nsent after me.  Once we exchanged a few broadsides, but another\\nman-of-war hove in sight, and I was compelled to leave her.  She shall\\nnot accuse me of running from her, now that she is alone, and by\\nto-morrow morning I will give her the opportunity of making the report\\nof my capture if she can; but if I capture her, you may guess the rest.\"\\n\\nWe remained till nearly sunset watching the motions of the schooner.\\nVincent then went down the hill to give orders for sailing, leaving me\\nwith the glass.  I again directed it to the schooner, and perceived that\\nshe was making signals.\\n\\nThen she is not alone, thought I; and Vincent may not capture her quite\\nso easily as he expects.  I looked in vain for the other vessel; I could\\nnot see her; I therefore concluded that she must be somewhere under the\\nland, and hidden by it from my sight.\\n\\nThe signals were repeated till dusk when I went down the hill, and found\\nthat all was bustle and activity, Vincent superintending himself the\\npreparations for sailing.  I did not interrupt him to tell him that I\\nhad perceived the schooner making signals.  I had an idea, somehow or\\nanother, that I should regain my liberty, and was as anxious as Vincent\\nthat the Stella should be under weigh.\\n\\nBefore ten o\\'clock everything was ready.  Vincent had told his men that\\nthe English man-of-war schooner was outside, and that he intended to\\nfight her; the men appeared delighted at the proposal, and as resolute\\nand determined as men should be.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella was clear of the bay, everything was got ready for\\naction, and I must say that nothing could be more rapid or more quiet\\nthan their movements.  We stood out until we had gained an offing of\\nfive miles, and then made a reach along the shore towards the Havannah.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella had laid her head towards the Havannah, Vincent\\ncame down below.  I had latterly slept on one of the cabin sofas, but\\nhad this night remained with my clothes on, for I was not sure that we\\nmight not be in action before the morning.\\n\\nThe Arrow had gained the knowledge that our Rendezvous Bay was somewhere\\nabout the east end of the island, and had cruised accordingly, but could\\nnot discover it.\\n\\nVincent threw himself on the other sofa, and I pretended to asleep; as I\\ndid not wish to enter into conversation with him was too much occupied\\nwith my own thoughts, and felt that there would be nothing in common\\nbetween us at such a moment.  He was very soon asleep, and he talked in\\nhis sleep.  He was evidently in action, and gave his orders, every now\\nand then speaking a few words aloud, and then it appeared as if he had\\ntaken the English schooner, and that he was fulfilling his vows of\\nretaliation.  I shuddered as I heard the half-broken menaces--the\\nexulting laugh which occasionally burst from his lips.  I arose and\\nwatched him as he slept; his hands were continually in motion, and his\\nfists clenched, and he smiled.  Merciful Heaven! what a tale of savage\\ncruelty that smile foretold if he were successful!  I knelt down and\\nprayed that he might be foiled in his endeavours.  As I rose I heard a\\nnoise and talking on deck, and one of the mates came down in the cabin.\\n\\n\"How does she bear?\" cried Vincent, starting up from his couch, as if he\\ninstinctively knew what was to be told.\\n\\n\"Two points on the weather bow, captain,\" replied the negro.  \"I think\\nshe has her foresheet to windward.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the time?\"\\n\\n\"One bell in the morning watch; it will be daylight in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Very good.  How far is she off?\"\\n\\n\"About four miles.\"\\n\\n\"Pipe to quarters; I will be up directly.\"\\n\\nVincent took down his sword and buckled on his belt; then his pistols,\\nwhich after having examined the primings, he fixed in his girdle.  I\\nstill remained as if asleep, and as he was going out of the cabin, he\\nturned to me.  \"He sleeps, poor boy; well, why should I wake him?--the\\nguns will rouse him up soon enough.\"  So saying, he went on deck.\\n\\nI considered what I should do.  To be on deck was hardly safe for me as\\na white person; and, indeed, what business had I there?  Why should I\\nexpose myself to the shot of my countrymen, or run the risk of losing my\\nlife from the rage of the negroes?  I therefore resolved on remaining\\nwhere I was--at all events, for the present.\\n\\nThe negroes now came into the cabin, for the after-magazine was under\\nthe forepart of it.  The hatch was taken up, the screens let down, and\\nall was dark.  I had nothing to do but to catch now and then the\\ncommands given by the negro captain, and draw my inference as to what\\nwas taking place.\\n\\nAlthough for the first half-hour I gained little information, after that\\ntime had elapsed I knew what was going on.  I heard a voice hailing us\\nfrom another vessel, and the reply of the Stella was a broadside.  There\\ncould be no mistake in that.  The Stella was then put about, and the\\nother broadside given without a return from her opponent.  At last it\\ncame, and as the shot whizzed over or tore up the planking of the\\ngunwales, I certainly did feel very strangely.  I had never been in\\naction before, and the sensation was, I confess, that of alarm; but it\\nwas so mingled with curiosity as to what was going on, that it was\\nimpossible to say what my feelings were.  I longed to be on deck, and\\ncertainly would have been, if I had thought that I was safe with the\\npirate crew: that alone prevented me; I remained, therefore, in a most\\nunpleasant state of ignorance and suspense.\\n\\nThe broadsides were now exchanged rapidly and the wounded, brought down\\nbetween decks every minute, told me that the action was severe.  The\\norders of the negro captain were occasionally heard--they were cool and\\ndetermined.  Every minute some fresh manoeuvre was executed, and the\\nguns still worked as if there was nothing else to attend to.  At last,\\nthe daylight came down the hatchway, and I left the cabin and walked\\nforward between decks; I found the deck strewed with wounded and dying\\nmen, calling for water.  I was glad to be able to do something which I\\ncould consistently do, and I brought water from the cask and gave it to\\nthem, one after another, as fast as I could; I think there were at least\\nthirty men lying about the lower deck, some in pools of their own blood,\\nand sinking fast, for there was no surgeon on board of the Stella.\\n\\nSome more wounded men were brought down, and a conversation took place\\nbetween one of the mates of the schooner, who was hurt, and the men who\\nbrought down the wounded, and listening to them, I found that at\\ndaylight they had discovered that an English frigate was under all sail,\\nbeating up to them, and about five miles to leeward; that in\\nconsequence, the Stella was now carrying on a running fight with the\\nschooner (who was to windward of her), and trying to escape.  This\\naccounted for the signals which I had perceived that the English\\nschooner was making the evening before.  My anxiety at this intelligence\\nwas naturally much increased.  The Stella was trying to escape, and her\\nsailing powers were so remarkable, that I was afraid she would succeed.\\n\\nThe action was still continued between the two schooners, but now the\\nshot no longer hit the Stella, nor were there any more wounded men\\nbrought down; it was evident that the two vessels were now firing at\\neach other\\'s masts and rigging, the one to prevent, and the other to\\neffect her escape, by dismantling her antagonist.  I felt as if I could\\nhave given my left hand to have gone on deck.  I waited half an hour\\nmore, and then, curiosity conquering my fear, I crept gradually up the\\nfore ladder.  The men were working the guns to windward, the lee-side of\\nthe deck was clear, and I stepped forward, and got into the head, where\\nI could see both to windward and to leeward.  To leeward I perceived the\\nfrigate about four miles distant with every stretch of canvass that she\\ncould set on a wind; I knew her directly to be the Calliope, my own\\nship, and my heart beat quick at the chance of being once more on board\\nof her.\\n\\nTo windward, as the smoke occasionally cleared away, I saw the Arrow\\nschooner close hauled on the same tack as the Stella, and distant about\\na mile, every ten seconds the smoke from her guns booming along the\\nwater\\'s surface, and the shot whizzing through our rigging; she had not\\nsuffered much from our fire: her sails were full of shot-holes, it is\\ntrue, but her spars were not injured.  I then turned my eyes upon the\\nmasts and rigging of the Stella: apparently, the damage done was about\\nequal to that received by the Arrow; our sails were torn, but our spars\\nwere unscathed.\\n\\nThe water was smooth, although the breeze was fresh, and both schooners\\nwere running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but the Stella\\nhad evidently the advantage of sailing, and fore-reached upon her\\nopponent.  I perceived that everything depended upon a lucky hit and\\nhaving satisfied myself with what I had seen, I hastened down below.\\n\\nFor more than half an hour the firing continued without advantage on\\neither side, when a yell was given by the negro crew, and I heard them\\ncry on the deck that the Arrow\\'s foretop-mast was shot away.  I heard\\nthe voice of Vincent cheering his men, and telling them to be steady in\\ntheir aim.  My heart sunk at the intelligence, and I sat down on a\\nchest.\\n\\nThe firing now slackened, for the Stella had shot ahead of the English\\nschooner, and the negroes on deck were laughing and in high good-humour.\\nFor a few minutes the firing ceased altogether, and I took it for\\ngranted that the Stella had left her pursuers far behind; when of a\\nsudden, a whole broadside of guns were poured into us, and there was a\\nterrible crashing and confusion on the deck.\\n\\nI ran up the ladder to see what had happened.  It appeared that as the\\nStella was crossing the bows of the Arrow, the latter had, as a last\\nchance thrown up in the wind, and discharged her whole broadside into\\nus: two shots had struck our mainmast, which had fallen by the board.  I\\nperceived at once that the Stella\\'s chance was over--nothing could save\\nher; she might resist the schooner but could not escape the frigate.\\n\\nI ran down below, and went into the cabin; I was afraid that the negroes\\nmight perceive the joy in my countenance.  I heard the angry voice of\\nthe negro captain--I heard him stamping with rage, and I thanked God\\nthat I was not by his side.  The wreck of the mast was soon cleared\\naway; I heard him address his negroes, point out to them that it was\\nbetter to die like men at the guns, than swing at the yard-arm like\\ndogs.  Some of them came down and took on deck a quarter-cask of\\nspirits, which was plentifully supplied to all.\\n\\nThe English schooner had borne down upon us, and the action now\\ncommenced at pistol-shot.  Never shall I forget what took place for\\nnearly three-quarters of an hour; the negroes, most of them intoxicated,\\nfought with rage and fury indescribable--their shouts--their screams--\\ntheir cursing and blasphemy, mingled with the loud report of the guns,\\nthe crashing of the spars and bulwarks, the occasional cry of the\\nwounded, and the powerful voice of Vincent.  It was terrific between\\ndecks; the smoke was so thick, that those who came down for the powder\\ncould not see, but felt their way to the screen.  Every two seconds, I\\nheard the men come aft, toss off the can of liquor, and throw it on the\\ndeck, hen they went to resume their labour at their guns.\\n\\nAt the end of the time I have mentioned, the shot flew from to leeward,\\nas well as from to windward: the frigate had got within range, and was\\npouring in her broadside; still the firing and the shouting on the deck\\nof the Stella continued, but the voices were fewer; and as the firing of\\nthe frigate became more severe, they became fainter and fainter; and at\\nlast but an occasional gun was fired from our decks.\\n\\nI became so uneasy, that I could remain where I was no longer; I went\\nforward on the lower deck again, and tumbling over the wounded and the\\ndead, I crept up the fore-ladder.  I looked over the coamings of the\\nhatchway; the decks were clear of smoke, for not a gun was being fired.\\nMerciful Heaven! what a scene of slaughter!  Many of the guns were\\ndismantled, and the decks were strewed with the splinters and plankings\\nof the gunwale, broken spars, and negroes lying dead, or drunk, in all\\ndirections--some cut and torn to pieces, others whole, but mixed up with\\nthe fragments of other bodies: such a scene of blood I have never since\\nwitnessed.  Out of the whole crew, I do not think there were twenty men\\nleft unhurt, and these were leaning or lying down, exhausted with\\nfatigue or overcome with liquor, on various parts of the deck.\\n\\nThe fighting was over; there was not one man at his gun--and of those\\nwho remained still alive, one or two fell, while I was looking up from\\nthe shot, which continued every minute to pierce the bulwarks.  Where\\nwas Vincent?  I dare not go aft to see.  I dare not venture to meet his\\neye.  I dived down below again, and I returned aft to the cabin; there\\nwas no more demand for powder; not a soul was to be seen abaft.\\nSuddenly the after-hatchway grating was thrown off; I heard some one\\ndescend; I knew it was the hurried tread of the negro captain.  It was\\nso dark, and the cabin so full of smoke, that, coming from the light, he\\ndid not perceive me, although I could distinguish him.  He was evidently\\nbadly wounded, and tottered in his walk: he came into the cabin, put his\\nhand to his girdle, and felt for his pistol, and then he commenced\\npulling down the screen, which was between him and the magazine.  His\\nintentions were evident; which were to blow up the vessel.\\n\\nI felt that I had not a moment to lose.  I dashed past him, ran up the\\nladder, sprung aft to the taffrail, and dashed over the stern into the\\nsea.  I was still beneath the surface, having not yet risen from my\\nplunge, when I heard and felt the explosion--felt it, indeed, so\\npowerfully, that it almost took away my senses; so great was the shock,\\neven when I was under the water, that I was almost insensible.  I have a\\nfaint recollection of being drawn down by the vortex of the sinking\\nvessel, and scrambling my way to the surface of the water, amidst\\nfragments of timbers and whirling bodies.  When I recovered myself, I\\nfound that I was clinging to a portion of the wreck, in a sort of patch,\\nas it were, upon the deep blue water, dark as ink, and strewed with\\nsplintered fragments.\\n\\nThere I remained some minutes, during which time I gained my\\nrecollection: I looked around and perceived the Arrow schooner, lying\\nabout one hundred yards off, totally dismantled, and my own frigate\\nabout a quarter of a mile to leeward, as bright and as fresh as if she\\nhad just been refitted.  I observed a signal, made by the Calliope to\\nthe schooner, which was answered.  I looked in vain towards the\\nschooner, expecting her to lower down a boat.  The fact was, that the\\nCalliope had made the signal for her to do so, and the schooner had\\nreplied that she had no boat that could swim.  I then perceived that the\\nfrigate had lowered down a boat which was pulling towards me, and I\\nconsidered myself as safe.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, during which I had quite recovered myself, the boat\\npulled into the mass of floating fragments, and then the sailors ceased\\nrowing to look about them.  They perceived and pulled towards me--\\nhoisted me in over the gunwale, and laid me at the bottom of the boat.\\nI scrambled on my feet, and would have gone _aft_, when the midshipman\\nof the boat said to the men, \"Pass that cursed young pirate forward--\\ndon\\'t let him come aft here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, Mr Lascelles,\" thinks I--\"so you don\\'t know me; you shall know\\nme by-and-by.\"  I quite forgot that I was stained black, till one of the\\nmen who seized me by the collar to pass me forward, said, \"Hand along\\nthe nigger.  He\\'s a young one for the gallows, any how.\"\\n\\nThey handed me forward, and I did not choose to say who I was.  My love\\nof fun returned the moment that I was again with my shipmates.  After\\nlooking well round and ascertaining that I was the only one left alive,\\nthey pulled back to the frigate; and the midshipman went up to report.\\nI was handed up the side and remained at the break of the gangway, while\\nthe captain and first lieutenant were talking with Mr Lascelles: during\\nwhich Mr Tommy Dott came up to me, and, putting his finger to his left\\near, gave a cluck with his tongue, as much as to say, \"You\\'ll be hanged,\\nmy good fellow.\"\\n\\nI could not help giving the first mason\\'s sign which I taught to Mr\\nGreen in return for Tommy\\'s communication; to wit, putting my thumb to\\nmy nose, and extending my finger out towards him; at which Tommy Dott\\nexpressed much indignation, and called me a precious impudent varmin.\\nThe men who were near us laughed, and said that I was game at all\\nevents.  No one knew me; for not only was my face well stained, but I\\nwas covered from head to foot with a solution of salt water and\\ngunpowder, which made me still more indistinguishable.\\n\\nI had remained at the gangway about two minutes, when the first\\nlieutenant said, \"Bring the prisoner here.\"\\n\\nI immediately went aft; and as soon as I was standing before Captain\\nDelmar and the first lieutenant--(and behind were all the officers,\\nanxious to hear what I had to disclose)--I put my hand to my head,\\nhaving no hat, as may be supposed, and said, \"_Come on board, sir_,\"\\nreporting myself, as is usually the custom of officers when they return\\nfrom leave or duty.\\n\\n\"Good Heavens! that voice!--why, who are you?\" cried Captain Delmar,\\nstarting back a pace.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, sir,\" replied I, again putting my hand to my head.\\n\\nBob Cross, who was, with many of the seamen, close to me, quite\\nforgetting etiquette, ran up and caught me round the waist, looking me\\nfull in the face: \"It is him, sir--it is him!  Huzzah! huzzah!\" and all\\nthe seamen joined in the huzzahs, which were, however, mingled with a\\ngreat deal of laughter.\\n\\n\"Merciful Heaven! and so you have been blown up in that vessel,\" said\\nthe first lieutenant, coming to me, with great kindness.  \"Are you much\\nburnt?  Why, he\\'s quite black--where\\'s the surgeon?\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t hurt at all, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Let him be taken down and examined,\" said the captain with some\\nemotion; \"if not hurt, let him come into the cabin to me.\"\\n\\nThe captain went down the ladder, and then I shook hands with Tommy Dott\\nand all the other officers and midshipmen; and I will say that my\\nre-appearance appeared to give unusual satisfaction.  I went down into\\nthe gun-room and was stripped.  They were much surprised to find that I\\nwas not hurt, and even more when they discovered that I was black all\\nover, and that washing would not restore my colour.\\n\\n\"Why, Keene,\" said the first lieutenant, \"how is it that you have\\nchanged your colour?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sir, I\\'ve been playing the nigger for these last three months.  It\\nis a long story, but I will go with you to the captain, and I will tell\\nit there.\"\\n\\nAs soon as I had put on my uniform, I went up with Mr Hippesley to the\\ncabin, and having, at the captain\\'s request, taken a chair, I entered\\ninto a full explanation, which lasted more than an hour.\\n\\nAs soon as I had finished, Mr Hippesley who had plenty to do on deck,\\nbut who could not leave until he had heard my story, quitted the cabin,\\nand I found myself alone with the captain.\\n\\n\"I must say that I gave you up for lost,\" said Captain Delmar; \"the\\nboat\\'s crew were picked up the next morning, and reported that you were\\ndrowned in the cabin of the vessel.  Scoundrels, to desert you in that\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think they were to blame, sir; the water being so high in the\\ncabin, and my not answering to their call.\"\\n\\n\"But did they call you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; I heard them call when I was half asleep, and I did not\\nanswer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am glad to hear you say so; but so convinced have we been of\\nyour loss, that I have written to your mother on the subject.  Strange,\\nthis is the second time that she has been distressed in this way.  You\\nappear to have a charmed life, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I shall long live to do credit to your protection, sir,\" replied\\nI.\\n\\n\"I hope so too, Mr Keene,\" replied the captain, very kindly; \"I\\nsincerely hope so too.  In all this business you have conducted yourself\\nvery manfully.  It does you great credit, and your mother ought to be\\nproud of you.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I, for I was overjoyed at such language from\\nCaptain Delmar, and I thought to myself, if he says my mother ought be\\nproud of me, he feels so himself.\\n\\n\"Of course, you cannot do duty under such a masquerade as you are at\\npresent,\" continued the captain, who referred to my stained skin.  \"I\\npresume it will wear off by-and-by.  You will dine with me to-day; now\\nyou may go to your messmates.\"\\n\\nI left the cabin, bowing very respectfully, and pleased with what had\\noccurred.  I hastened to join my messmates, not, however, until I had\\nshaken hands with Bob Cross, who appeared as delighted to see me as if\\nhe was my father.\\n\\nI leave the reader to imagine the sort of levee which I held both on the\\nquarter-deck and below.  Mr Hippesley could not get any of the officers\\nto mind their duty.  I certainly was for two or three days the greatest\\npersonage in the ship.  After that, I had time to tell the whole of my\\nhistory quietly to Bob Cross.\\n\\nBob Cross, when he had heard me without interruption, said, \"Well,\\nMaster Keene, there\\'s no telling what a man\\'s born to till after he\\'s\\ndead, and then it\\'s all known: but it does appear to me that you are\\nborn to something out of the common.  Here you are, not sixteen, not\\nonly playing a man\\'s part, but playing it manfully.  You have been put\\nin most difficult situations, and always have fallen upon your feet in\\nthe end.  You appear to have an old head upon very young shoulders; at\\none moment to be a scampish boy full of mischief, and at another a\\nresolute, cool, and clever man.  Sarcumstances, they say, make men, and\\nso it appears in you; but it does seem strange for one and the same lad\\nto be stealing the purser\\'s plums at one moment, and twisting a devil of\\na nigger pirate round his finger the very next; and then you have had\\nsuch escapes--twice reported dead at head-quarters, and twice come to\\nlife again.  Now Master Keene, I\\'ve very good news to tell you: you\\ndon\\'t know how high you stand with the captain and officers: there\\'s a\\nfeeling of envy against a lad who goes ahead (as well as a man) which\\nblinds people to his real merits; but when he is supposed to be dead and\\ngone, and no longer in the way of others, then every one tells the real\\ntruth; and I do assure you that not only the officers, but the captain\\nhimself, grieved most sorely at your loss.  I saw the captain\\'s eyes\\nwink more than once when speaking of you, and the first lieutenant was\\nalways telling the other mids that he had not one worth his salt, now\\nthat you were gone.  And now that you have come back and gained so much\\ncredit for what has passed, I do really think that the captain is proud\\nof you.  I overheard a little conversation between the captain and first\\nlieutenant the day you came on board, after you had been in the cabin\\ntelling your adventures, and all that I can say is, that the game is in\\nyour own hands, if you only play your cards well, and never let Captain\\nDelmar have the least idea that you know that you have such claims upon\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"That I certainly will not,\" replied I, \"as it might check his feeling\\ntowards me.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly: I\\'ve often thought about you, and now that I like you so much,\\nI watch the captain for your sake, and listen particularly to what he\\nsays after dinner especially, when I\\'ve the opportunity; for you see,\\nwhen gentlemen drink wine, they speak more freely as to what they really\\nthink, just as we foremast-men do when we get our grog on board.  The\\ngreatest misfortune which could happen to you in your position would be,\\nthe captain marrying and having children on the right side of the\\nblanket as they call it.  Now I\\'ve often heard the captain express a\\ndislike to matrimony, and laugh at people\\'s getting married, which has\\npleased me very much for your sake, Master Percival.  You see, a man\\ndon\\'t think much of marrying after forty, and the captain must be fifty,\\nif not more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes: but if his brother dies--and he is a very infirm man--the captain\\nwill then be Viscount de Versely, and inherit very large estates, and\\nthen he will marry to have an heir to the title and estates even if\\nthere is no love in the case.\"\\n\\n\"So he may,\" replied Cross--\"there\\'s no saying; but still, even if he\\ndoes, it ain\\'t certain that he has a family; chickens must not be\\ncounted before they are hatched.  All you have to pray for then is, that\\nthe brother may prove as tough as our old admirals, whose senses get\\ntired of staying any longer in their bodies, and leave them long before\\ntheir hulks are worn out.\"\\n\\n\"Why do admirals live so long?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it is for the same reason that salt meat keeps so much\\nlonger than fresh; they have been forty or fifty years with the salt\\nspray washing in their faces and wetting their jackets, and so in time,\\nd\\'ye see, they become as it were pickled with brine.  Talking about\\nthat, how long will it be before you get that tanning off you?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; but as the captain says I\\'m to do no duty while it lasts,\\nI hope it won\\'t wear off too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Spoken like a midshipman: now take my advice, although not ordered to\\nyour duty, come up on deck and take your spy-glass.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve lost it, unfortunately.  That was a good glass, for it saved my\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it turned out as good for you as a Freemason\\'s sign, which is more\\nthan Mr Green can say.  I don\\'t think he\\'ll ever make a sailor--he\\'d\\nbetter bear up for clerk, and then he might do very well for a purser\\nby-and-by.  There\\'s eight bells, Master Keene, so I think we had better\\nsay good night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\\n\\nThe Arrow schooner had suffered very severely in the contest, having\\nlost her commanding officer and thirteen men killed and wounded: indeed,\\nhad not the Calliope been at hand, it was the general opinion that the\\nStella would have overpowered her, notwithstanding that the latter had\\nlost her mainmast, for the Arrow was completely dismantled, and would\\nnot have been able to have made sail.\\n\\nThe Calliope sent her carpenters and best seamen on board to repair her\\ndamages, and the next day we stood away for Port Royal, Jamaica, to\\nannounce the destruction of the pirate vessel.\\n\\nIn the morning Captain Delmar sent for me.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, as you cannot do duty for the present, and as I do not wish\\nyou to be idle, I think you had better pay a little attention to\\nnavigation.  You send in your day\\'s work, I perceive, but I suppose you\\nhave never regularly gone through a course of study.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I fudge my day\\'s work, and I should be very glad\\nto learn navigation properly.\"\\n\\n\"So I presume.  Well, then, I have spoken with Mr Smith, the master,\\nwho has promised me to give you the necessary instruction.  You will\\ncommence to-morrow; you can sit at the table in the fore-cabin, where\\nyou will have nothing to distract your attention.  You may go now.\"\\n\\nI bowed and left the cabin, and meeting Bob Cross on the main deck, I\\ntold him what the captain had said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it, Master Keene; it shows that the captain does now take a\\nstrong interest in you.  He has never taken any trouble of that kind\\nwith any midshipman before.  It will be of great service to you, so pay\\nattention; it will please the captain if the master gives a good report\\nof you.  Who knows but you may be sent away in a prize, and I sent with\\nyou to take care of you?  Wouldn\\'t that be a capital spree?\"\\n\\nThe next day I commenced accordingly, under the tuition of the master,\\nand as I had not Tommy Dott to play with, I gave satisfaction, and\\ncontinued to do so until our arrival at Port Royal, when the captain\\nwent up to the admiral\\'s, stating all the particulars of the action,\\nand, by way of sequel, my adventures on board of the pirate vessel.  The\\nadmiral was so much interested that he requested Captain Delmar to bring\\nme on shore to dine with me the next day.\\n\\nI was still very black; but that made me, I presume more interesting.  I\\ntold my story over again, and it afforded great amusement to the\\ncompany; particularly to the ladies; and I have reason to believe that\\nmany compliments were paid me behind my back, by the admiral and\\nofficers who dined there; at all events, Captain Delmar was much\\npleased.\\n\\nMy strange history soon got wind.  The governor heard of it, and asked\\nCaptain Delmar about it.  The consequence was, that I received another\\ninvitation from the governor, and Captain Delmar again informed me that\\nI might tell my own story, which I did, modestly as before.  I say\\nmodestly, for I never was a boaster at any time; and I really believe\\nthat I thought much less of the circumstances than those did to whom I\\nnarrated them.  I had at that time but one wish, which was to find\\nfavour in the sight of Captain Delmar.  I felt that all my prospects in\\nlife depended upon that; and aware of his disposition, and the deference\\nthat he expected, humility had become, as it were, habitual.\\n\\nDuring the time that we remained at Port Royal I continued my studies in\\nthe cabin and as the captain remained almost altogether on shore, I\\nfound the run of the cabin very pleasant; but as I had no inclination to\\nstudy the whole of the day, I was not sorry that Tommy Dott was very\\noften my companion in the cabin, an entrance to which, as he could not\\npass the sentry at the door, he obtained by climbing down the mizen\\nchains, and creeping into the port windows.  As soon as the captain\\'s\\nboat was seen coming off Tommy was out again by the port as quick as a\\nmonkey, and I was very studiously poring over right-angled triangles.  I\\nrose, of course, as the captain entered the cabin.  \"Sit down, Mr\\nKeene,\" he would say--\"sit down; the master has reported favourably of\\nyou, and I am glad to hear of it.\"\\n\\nOne morning, when, as usual, Tommy Dott had come through the port, we\\nwere so busily employed with a caricature which we were making of old\\nCulpepper, that the captain\\'s boat came alongside without our being\\naware of it, and the captain\\'s voice speaking to the first lieutenant as\\nhe was descending the after-ladder was the first intimation we received\\nof his being on board.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Tommy Dott to escape without being seen as he\\nclimbed out.  The table which was in the centre of the cabin was covered\\nwith a blue cloth, large enough for the table when all the additional\\nleaves were put to it, and in its present reduced size the cloth fell\\ndown to the deck; I pointed it out to Tommy, as the sentry\\'s hand upon\\nthe handle of the door announced the immediate entrance of the captain,\\nand he darted underneath the table, that he might escape detection\\nintending as soon as the captain went into the after-cabin to make his\\nretreat by the cabin-door or windows.  The captain entered, and I rose,\\nas usual, from my chair.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I have occasion to speak to the first lieutenant\\non important private business; oblige me by leaving the cabin till that\\nis done.  You may as well tell Mr Hippesley that I wish to see him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I making a bow, and leaving the cabin.  I felt very\\nmuch alarmed lest Tommy should be discovered in his hiding-place; and\\nafter the captain had stated that he had particular business with the\\nfirst lieutenant, it was my duty, knowing that Mr Dott was there, to\\nhave said so.  I hardly knew what to do, or how to act.  After all, it\\nwas no great crime as it stood.  Tommy Dott had come into the cabin\\nwithout leave, and had concealed himself; but if I was to allow Tommy to\\nremain there and listen to important and particular business, evidently\\nof a secret nature, I should forfeit the good opinion and confidence of\\nthe captain: nevertheless, I was very unwilling to betray him; I was\\ndreadfully puzzled, and when I went to the first lieutenant he perceived\\nmy confusion.\\n\\n\"Why, what is the matter with you, Mr Keene?--you look quite\\nfrightened,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I am,\" replied I; \"and I think it my duty to tell you why I\\nam so.\"\\n\\nI then informed him that Tommy Dott was under the cabin-table, and\\nwould, of course, hear the secret communications of the captain.\\n\\n\"You have done very right, Mr Keene, and I know how unpleasant it is to\\nyou to inform against your messmate; but at present there is no harm\\ndone.\"\\n\\nHe then laughed, and said, \"However, Mr Dott shall never know that you\\nhave said anything about it, and I will frighten him out of the cabin\\nfor the future.\"\\n\\nHe then went down the ladder, and into the fore-cabin.  I expected that\\nhe would have discovered Tommy as if by accident, but such was not the\\ncase.  The captain had just gone into the after-cabin, and Mr Hippesley\\nimmediately followed him, and shutting the door, informed him of Mr\\nDott\\'s position, and why I had made it known.  The captain could not\\nhelp laughing, as, after all, it was no great offence.\\n\\nHe then gave the necessary information to the first lieutenant, and they\\nboth walked into the fore-cabin; the first lieutenant saying, \"If you\\nplease, then, Captain Delmar, I will send a boat immediately with the\\nletter.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied the captain, sitting down, and who evidently was\\ninclined to join in the joke with Mr Hippesley.  \"Sentry, send the\\nofficer on deck to man the jolly-boat, and tell Mr Dott to come here\\nimmediately.\"\\n\\nI was on deck when the sentry put his head up the ladder and gave the\\norder, and I immediately perceived the plan of the first lieutenant and\\nthe state of alarm in which Tommy Dott must have been put.\\n\\nThe jolly-boat was manned, and Mr Dott called for in every quarter of\\nthe ship, but he did not make his appearance.  After a delay of several\\nminutes, the officer on deck went down into the cabin, reporting that\\nthe jolly-boat had been manned some time but that Mr Dott was not to be\\nfound.\\n\\n\"Not to be found!\" replied the captain; \"why, he can\\'t have fallen\\noverboard.\"\\n\\n\"Not he, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant; \"he has gone to sleep\\nsomewhere: either in the tops or the fore-topmast staysail netting.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be a very troublesome boy,\" replied the captain.\\n\\n\"Very useless, indeed, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"Sentry,\\nhave they found Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; quarter-masters have been everywhere.  He\\'s not in the ship.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd!\" observed the captain.\\n\\n\"Oh! he\\'ll turn up soon, sir; but really, Captain Delmar, if you were to\\ngive him two or three dozen at the cabin gun, it would bring him to his\\nsenses.\"\\n\\n\"That I most certainly will do,\" replied Captain Delmar; \"and I\\nauthorise you to do it, Mr Hippesley, as soon as he makes his\\nappearance; it will be of some service to him; but I hope no accident\\nhas happened to him.\"\\n\\n\"I have no fear of that, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant: \"if the\\npurser\\'s steward\\'s room had been open to-day, I should have sent to see\\nif he was not locked up in another attempt to steal raisins, but that\\nhas not been the case.  By-the-by, the spirit-room was open this\\nmorning, and he may have been down there, and may have had the hatches\\nput over him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must send another midshipman; call Mr Keene,\" said Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nThe sentry called me, and I made my appearance.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you\\'ll go on shore to the dockyard in the jolly-boat: give\\nthat letter to the master attendant, and wait for an answer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Have you seen anything of Mr Dott?\" said the first lieutenant; \"you\\nare constantly together.\"\\n\\n\"I saw him just before Captain Delmar came on board, sir, but I have not\\nseen him since.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, we will settle accounts with the young gentleman as soon as\\nhe turns up,\" replied the captain: \"you may go, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\nI perceived that the captain and first lieutenant both smiled as I left\\nthe cabin.  It appeared that soon after they left it and the captain\\nwent on shore; but Tommy was so frightened that he remained in his\\nhiding-place, as he made sure he would be flogged if he made his\\nappearance, and he resolved to remain where he was until my return, that\\nhe might consult me.\\n\\nAs soon as I had reported myself, and given the answer to the first\\nlieutenant, I hastened to the cabin, and then poor Tommy crawled from\\nunder the table; the tears were still wet on his cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall be flogged, Keene, as sure as I stand here.  Tell me, what can\\nI do--what can I say?\"\\n\\n\"Tell the truth; that\\'s the best way,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Tell the captain that I was hid under the table! that would never do.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, it\\'s the best plan,\" replied I; \"and it is the only\\nadvice I can give you: you may be flogged if you tell the truth, but you\\nare _sure_ to be flogged if you tell a lie.  It will only add to your\\noffence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been thinking about it--I\\'m sure that Mr Hippesley will\\nflog me if he catches me to-day or to-morrow; but if I remain hid for a\\nday or two, they will really think that I have fallen overboard, and\\nthen they will say, `poor Tommy Dott,\\' and perhaps be so glad when I do\\nmake my appearance, that they will forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I, delighted at the idea; \"I\\'m sure they will, if you do\\ntell the truth when you appear again.\"\\n\\n\"Then, that is what I\\'ll do.  The first lieutenant said that I might be\\nin the spirit-room.  Where shall I go to?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said I, \"you must remain under the table till dark, and then you\\nmay easily slip down into the coal-hole, where it is so dark that they\\nnever will see you, even if they go down for coals.  It is the only\\nplace I know of; stay there all to-morrow and next day, and come up in\\nthe evening; or the next morning perhaps will be better.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a very good place,\" replied Tommy; \"anything better than\\nbeing flogged; but will you bring me something to eat and drink?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me, Tommy,\" replied I; \"I\\'ll contrive to bring you\\nsomething every night.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll do that,\" replied he.\\n\\n\"Yes; and tell the truth when you come out,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my honour I will;\" and so saying, Tommy, hearing a noise,\\nagain dived under the cabin table.\\n\\nSoon afterwards I went out of the cabin.  The first lieutenant beckoned\\nme to him, and asked me where Mr Dott was, and I told him what had been\\narranged between us.  He laughed very much, and said--\\n\\n\"Well, if Master Tommy punishes himself by two days\\' confinement in the\\ncoal-hole, and tells the truth when he comes out, I think I may promise\\nhe will get off his flogging; but don\\'t you say that I have spoken to\\nyou about it, and let him do as he proposes.\"\\n\\nWhen it was dark, I supplied Tommy with provisions, and he gained the\\ncoal-hole without being discovered.\\n\\nThe next day the speculations at his disappearance were general, and it\\nwas now believed that poor Tommy had fallen overboard, and, as the\\nsharks are thick enough in Port Royal, that he was safely stowed away in\\none of their maws.  I will say that the whole of the ship\\'s company were\\nvery sorry for him, with the exception of Mr Culpepper, who observed\\nthat no good ever came of a boy who stole raisins.\\n\\n\"So you think, that because a lad steals a few of your confounded\\nplums,\" observed the second lieutenant, \"he deserves to be eaten by the\\nsharks.  If I were Tommy Dott, I would haunt you if I could.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of dead men,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"they are quiet\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps so; but recollect, you make them chew tobacco, and therefore\\nthey ought to rise up in judgment against you, if they do against any\\none.\"\\n\\nAs this conversation passed on the quarter-deck, it put an idea in my\\nhead.  That night I went to Tommy, whom I found terribly tired of\\nsitting on the coals.  I brought him a bottle of mixed grog, and some\\nboiled beef and biscuit.  I consoled him by telling him that every one\\nwas sorry at his disappearance, and that I was convinced that he would\\nnot be punished if he told the truth.\\n\\nTommy was for leaving the coal-hole immediately, but I pointed out to\\nhim that the captain had not been on board that a and that it was\\nnecessary that the captain should believe that he had fallen overboard\\nas well as the officers, or his compassion would not be roused.  Tommy\\nsaw the propriety of this, and consented to remain another day.  I then\\ntold him what Mr Culpepper had said, and I added, \"Now, Tommy, if Mr\\nCulpepper should see you by any chance, pretend to be your ghost.\"\\n\\n\"That I will,\" replied Tommy, \"if I get six dozen for it.\"  I then left\\nhim.\\n\\nOn my return on deck, I saw Bob Cross; he was on shore during the major\\nportion of the day, attending upon the captain, and as I was no longer\\nin the captain\\'s gig, I saw but little of him.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I think you have quite recovered your\\ncolour by this time, and I hope to see you in the gig again.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think I shall yet awhile--I have not yet learnt navigation\\nenough; but the master says he will be done with me in a fortnight, if I\\ngo on as well as I do now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I heard him tell the captain that you were very quick, and would\\nbe a good navigator but I can\\'t get over the loss of poor Tommy Dott; he\\nwas a little scampish, that\\'s sartin, but still he was a merry,\\nkind-hearted boy--too good for the sharks, at all events.  You must feel\\nhis loss, Mr Keene, for you were always together.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t, Bob,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m sorry to hear you say that, Mr Keene; I thought you had a\\nkinder heart.\"\\n\\n\"So I have, Bob; but I\\'ll tell you a secret, known only to the first\\nlieutenant and me; and that is, Tommy\\'s in the coal-hole, very dirty,\\nbut quite safe.\"\\n\\nBob Cross burst into a fit of laughing, which lasted some time.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, you have really taken a weight off my mind; now tell\\nme all about it.  You know I\\'m safe.\"\\n\\nI then told Bob what had happened, and of Tommy\\'s intention to make his\\nappearance on the following evening or the next morning.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"you\\'re mischief itself, Master Keene, and that\\'s a\\nfact; however, it\\'s all right this time, and you have the captain and\\nfirst lieutenant as your confidants and partners in the joke.  You did\\nperfectly right and I\\'m sure the captain and first lieutenant must be\\npleased with you; but recollect, Master Keene, keep your distance as\\nbefore; don\\'t presume.\"\\n\\n\"Never fear, Bob,\" replied I: \"but now I have told you that, I want you\\nto assist me.\"  I then repeated the conversation of Mr Culpepper with\\nthe second lieutenant.\\n\\n\"Now,\" continued I; \"you see, Cross, I can\\'t do anything myself; Mr\\nCulpepper hates me, and would suspect me; but if we could only frighten\\nhim: you might, for he would not think you were playing him a trick.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" replied Bob; \"it will be a good thing for Tommy Dott, and a\\nnice wind-up of this affair.  Let me alone.  When I come on board\\nto-morrow evening I\\'ll manage it if I can.\"\\n\\nAfter a little more conversation, we separated for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning the captain came on board.  He remained on deck with\\nthe first lieutenant for some minutes, during which of course, he was\\nmade acquainted with Tommy Dott\\'s position.  When he came down into the\\ncabin, I moved from my seat, as respectful and serious as before; and\\nwhen ordered to sit down again, resumed my studies with great apparent\\ndiligence.  He did not say a word to me about Tommy Dott; and as he was\\ngoing out of the cabin, Mr Culpepper was announced by the sentry.\\n\\n\"If you please, Captain Delmar,\" said Mr Culpepper, with his usual\\nprofound bow, \"what are we to do with the effects of Mr Dott, who has\\nfallen overboard?  By the regulations of the service, they should be\\nsold before the mast.  And I also wish to know whether he is to be\\ncontinued to be victualled, or whether it is your pleasure that he is\\ndischarged as dead?\"\\n\\nThe captain smiled, and turned his face towards me; but I continued with\\nmy eyes down on my book.\\n\\n\"Perhaps we had better wait till to-morrow, Mr Culpepper,\" replied the\\ncaptain, \"and then you may sell his effects, and put DD to his name,\\npoor fellow.\"  And having made this reply, the captain went out of his\\ncabin.  Mr Culpepper followed; and shortly afterwards the captain went\\non shore again.\\n\\nBefore dusk, the captain\\'s gig, as usual, returned on board, and I was\\nat the gangway to meet Bob Cross; the boat was hoisted up, and then Bob\\ncame to me.\\n\\n\"I must first go down and see Mr Dott, that I may be able to swear to\\nthe fact.\"  Bob did so, and then returned on deck.  Mr Culpepper was\\nabaft, walking by himself, when Bob went up and accosted him.\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Bob, touching his hat, \"did the captain say\\nanything to you about coals, for I expect we shall not stay here much\\nlonger?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Then he must have forgot it, I suppose sir.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s plenty of coals,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I don\\'t know; but I think I heard the cook\\'s mate say as how\\nthey were getting rather low.\"\\n\\n\"Getting rather low! then there must have been great waste,\" exclaimed\\nMr C, who was very careful of his expenses.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how far it may be so; but I think it might be as well to\\nknow how matters stand; and if so be there\\'s plenty, why I can tell\\nCaptain Delmar when I go on shore to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see; I\\'ll go down myself to-night,\" replied Mr Culpepper.  \"The\\nmidshipmen are allowed a stove to themselves--very unusual--and they are\\ncooking all day.\"\\n\\n\"Talking about midshipmen, sir,\" replied Cross, \"you may think it\\'s very\\nodd but as I stand here--and you know, Mr Culpepper, I am not easily\\nscared--I saw that young Tommy Dott, or his ghost, this very evening.\"\\n\\nIt was now quite dark; and Mr Culpepper stared at the coxswain, and\\nthen replied, \"Pooh, nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no nonsense, I do assure you.  I saw him with these eyes, sure as\\nI stand here.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" exclaimed Mr C.\\n\\n\"Right forward, sir.  I only mention it to you, but don\\'t say a word\\nabout it, for I should only be laughed at; but I do assure you that I\\nwould kiss the Bible to it, if it was required.  I never did before\\nbelieve in anything of that sort, that\\'s sartain; but it\\'s no use\\ntalking about it, sir.  I think I had better get a lantern, and get over\\nthis coal business at once.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"but you won\\'t know how much coals\\nthere are: I must go myself and see.\"\\n\\nBob Cross was soon ready with the lantern, and went forward with Mr\\nCulpepper.  The hammocks had been piped down, and they were obliged to\\nbend double under them to get along the lower deck.  I followed\\nunperceived.\\n\\nThe descent into the coal-hole was by battens, and not very easy for an\\nold man like Mr C But Cross went down first, holding the light for the\\npurser to follow, which he did very slowly, and with great caution.  As\\nsoon as they both stood on the coals below, the purser took the light to\\nmake his survey.\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s plenty of coals for three months, coxswain,\" said he.  \"I\\nthought there was; you see they are nearly up to the beams abaft.\"\\n\\n\"Look! sir--look!\" exclaimed Cross, starting back; \"what\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" exclaimed Mr C, alarmed.\\n\\n\"There, sir--there he is: I told you so.\"\\n\\nThe purser\\'s eyes were directed to where Bob pointed, and then he beheld\\nTommy Dott standing immovable, with his arms extended, as if denouncing\\nhim--his eyes staring, and his mouth wide open.\\n\\n\"Mercy!--murder!\" cried the purser, dropping the lantern, which went out\\nand left them in the dark; and he tumbled down on the coals.\\n\\nBob Cross stepped over him, and hastened up to the lower deck, followed\\nby Tommy Dott, who first, by way of revenge, jumped several times upon\\nthe purser\\'s face and body before he climbed up.\\n\\nThe cry of the purser had given the alarm.  The master-at-arms hastened\\nforward with his lantern just as Tommy had made his appearance above the\\ncoamings.  Seeing Tommy as black as a sweep, he too was frightened; the\\nmen had put their heads out of their hammocks and some of them had seen\\nTommy.\\n\\nBob Cross, as he crawled aft, cried out, \"Tommy Dott\\'s ghost!\"  I had\\npretended to be terrified out of my wits as I ran aft, and all was\\nconfusion on the lower deck.  The first lieutenant had come out of the\\nwardroom, and seeing me, he inquired what was the matter.  I replied\\nthat Mr Culpepper had gone down into the coal-hole, and had seen Mr\\nDott\\'s ghost.  He laughed heartily, and went back.\\n\\nTommy had in the mean time made his appearance in the mids\\' berth, at\\nwhich they had all rushed from him in dismay, just as I entered; when I\\ncaught him by the hand saying, \"Tommy, my boy, how are you?\"  They then\\nperceived that it was Tommy himself, and order was restored.\\n\\nMr Culpepper was hoisted up out of the coal-hole; Master Tommy having\\njumped upon his face, he looked a very miserable object, as he was well\\nblackened, as well as much bruised from the soles of Tommy\\'s shoes, and\\nhis nose had bled profusely.  He was very incoherent for some time; but\\nthe doctor gave him an opiate, and put him to bed.\\n\\nThe next morning the whole affair was explained on the quarterdeck,\\nMaster Tommy well reprimanded, and desired to return to his duty.  The\\ncaptain was very much amused at the winding up of this affair, as it was\\na capital story to tell at the governor\\'s.  Tommy never had an idea that\\nI had blown upon him, nor did Mr Culpepper imagine that their meeting\\nwas premeditated.\\n\\nI had now completed the usual course of navigation under the master, and\\nhad no longer any cause for remaining in the cabin; I therefore returned\\nto my berth; but as I had taken a liking to navigation, I now was\\nemployed daily in working sights and rating the chronometer.\\n\\nWe remained three weeks longer in Port Royal, and then were ordered out\\non a cruise, on the South American coast.  There we continued for nearly\\nsix months without anything occurring worth relating, except our having\\ncaptured four good prizes.  We were returning to Jamaica, when we fell\\nin with a schooner, which gave us the intelligence of the capture of the\\nisland of Curacao by four English frigates.\\n\\nAs we were near to the island and short of water, Captain Delmar\\nresolved to touch at it, and remained two or three days.\\n\\nThe reader will perhaps recollect that the old Dutch gentleman, whose\\nlife I had saved in the pirate vessel, had stated that his name was\\nVanderwelt, and that he lived at Curacao.  The next evening we entered\\nthe harbour, and it was astonishing to every one how so strong a place\\ncould have been taken by so small a force.  The commodore, who had\\nplenty of work on hand, requested, or rather ordered, our captain to\\nremain with him for ten days or a fortnight, to assist him.\\n\\nOn the third day after our arrival I obtained leave to go on shore, as I\\nwished to find out the old Dutch gentleman.  As I was again in the\\ncaptain\\'s gig, I had very often landed, but had not had an opportunity\\nof making inquiries, as I could not leave my boat and boat\\'s crew.\\n\\nThis afternoon I landed in the gig, and went up through the gate into\\nthe town, but I could not find anyone who spoke English.  At last, by\\nasking for the house of Mynheer Vanderwelt, it was pointed out to me,\\nand I went up to the door; it was a very large house, with a verandah\\nall round it, painted bright green and while alternately.  There were\\nseveral slaves sitting down at the entrance, and I asked for Mynheer\\nVanderwelt; they stared at me, and wondered what I wanted, but as I was\\nin midshipman\\'s uniform, they were of course very civil, and one of them\\nbeckoned me to follow him, which I did, and was introduced to the old\\ngentleman, who was sitting in a cane arm-chair with his pipe in his\\nmouth, and fanned by two slave girls, about twelve years old.\\n\\nAs he had spoken to me in English on board of the pirate, I immediately\\nwent up to him, and said, \"How do you do, sir?\"\\n\\n\"I am very well, sir,\" replied he, taking the pipe out of his mouth.\\n\"What do you want? do you come from the English commodore?  What is his\\npleasure?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I do not come from the commodore; but I came up\\nto see you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that is all,\" replied the old gentleman, putting his pipe in his\\nmouth again, and resuming his smoking.  I felt rather nettled at his\\ntreatment, and then said--\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied he, \"I have not that honour.  I have never seen you\\nin my life before, and I do not know you.\"\\n\\nMy blood was up at this cool declaration.\\n\\n\"Then I wish you a good morning, sir,\" replied I; and turning on my\\nheel, I was strutting out with all the dignity of an offended\\nmidshipman, when I was met face to face by the little girl, his\\ndaughter.  She stared at me very much, and I passed her in sovereign\\ncontempt; she followed me timidly, and looked into my face, then panting\\nfor breath, seized me by the arm.  I turned to her at being stopped in\\nthis manner, and was about to shake her off with anything but\\npoliteness, when she screamed out, and in a moment had sprung up, and\\nwas hanging with both arms round my neck.\\n\\n\"Fader, fader,\" she cried out as I struggled to disengage myself.\\n\\nThe old gentleman came out at the summons.\\n\\n\"Stop him! fader; don\\'t let him go away,\" cried she in Dutch; \"it is he!\\nit is he!\"\\n\\n\"Who, my child?\" asked the old gentleman.\\n\\n\"The pirate-boy,\" replied the little girl, bursting into a paroxysm of\\ntears, on my shoulders.\\n\\n\"Mein Gott! it cannot be; he was _black_, my child; yet,\" continued the\\nold gentleman, looking at me, \"he is like him.  Tell me, sir, are you\\nour preserver?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I, \"I was; but that is of little consequence now.  Will\\nyou oblige me by removing this young lady?\" continued I, for I was\\nhighly offended.\\n\\n\"Sir, I ask your pardon,\" replied the old gentleman; \"but I am not to\\nblame.  How could I recognise you in a white person when you were so\\ndark-coloured at our meeting on board of that vessel?  I am not to\\nblame; indeed I am not, my dear young friend.  I would have given ten\\nthousand rix dollars to have met you, that I might prove my gratitude\\nfor your noble defence of us, and our preservation at such a risk.\\nCome, sir, you must forgive the mistake of an old man, who was certainly\\nnot inclined to be civil to an officer who belonged to the squadron, who\\nhad within these few days so humiliated us by their astonishing bravery\\nand success.  Let my little girl, whose life you saved, persuade you, if\\nI cannot.\"\\n\\nIn the mean time the little girl had dropped from my shoulder, and was\\non the floor, embracing my knees, and still sobbing.  I felt convinced\\nthat what the old gentleman said was true, and that he had not\\nrecognised me.  I had forgotten that I had been stained dark at the time\\nthat I had met them on board of the Stella.\\n\\nI therefore held out my hand to the old gentleman, and raising the\\nlittle girl, we all three went in together to where we had found the old\\ngentleman on my first introduction to him.\\n\\n\"If you knew how delighted I am to see you, and be able to express my\\nthanks,\" said Mynheer Vanderwelt, \"and poor Minnie too.  How often have\\nwe talked over that dreadful day, and wondered if ever we should see you\\nagain.  I assure you, on my honour, that now I no longer regret the\\ncapture of the island.\"\\n\\nMinnie stood by me during the time her father was speaking, her large\\nblue eyes beaming through the tears with which they brimmed; and as I\\nturned to her, our eyes met, and she smiled.  I drew her towards me.\\nShe appeared as if she only required some encouragement, for she\\nimmediately kissed me several times on the cheek nearest to her, every\\nnow and then saying a word or two in Dutch to her father, which I could\\nnot understand.\\n\\nI hardly need say, that after this, intimacy was soon brought about.  If\\nI thought that at first I had been treated with ingratitude, ample\\namends was made afterwards.\\n\\nThe old gentleman said during the evening, \"Good heaven! if my\\ndaughter\\'s eyes had not been sharper than mine; if you had gone away,\\nthinking that I did not choose to recognise you--had I found it out\\nafterwards, it would have broken my heart, and poor Minnie\\'s too.  Oh!\\nI am grateful--very grateful to God that it was not so.\"\\n\\nThat I passed a very pleasant evening the reader may imagine.  The\\nhousehold who had been told who I was, appeared to almost worship me.\\nThe old gentleman asked me a hundred questions as to my parentage,\\netcetera, about Captain Delmar and the service, and begged of me to\\nremain with him altogether while the frigate was in port.  I told him\\nthat was impossible, but that I would come as often as I could obtain\\nleave.  At nine o\\'clock I bade them good night, and was escorted to the\\nboat by six of the slaves carrying lanterns.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar, as well as all the other captains of the frigates, had\\ntaken up his quarters on shore for the harbour was so narrow and\\nlandlocked, that the heat on board was excessive.  I found that the next\\nday old Mr Vanderwelt had paid his respects to Captain Delmar, giving\\nhim an account of what had occurred on board of the pirate much more\\nflattering to me than what I had stated myself.  The steward was present\\nat the time, and he had told Bob Cross, who communicated it to me.\\nMynheer Vanderwelt had also begged as a favour that I might be permitted\\nto stay on shore with him during the time that the frigate was in\\nharbour, but to this Captain Delmar had not consented, promising,\\nhowever, that I should have occasional leave when the service would\\npermit of it.\\n\\nThe reader may recollect that the island of Curacao had been surrendered\\nto the English in 1800, and restored to the Dutch in 1802.  During that\\ninterval several English merchants had settled there and remained after\\nthe restoration, and now at the second capture we found them still on\\nthe island.  From these we received the information that Mr Vanderwelt\\nwas the richest man on the island, and that the Dutch government was\\nindebted to him in very large sums; that he had long retired from\\nbusiness, although he had large property in the Havannah, which he\\nreceived with his wife, who had been a Spanish lady, and that it was his\\nintention to have gone back to Holland by the first man-of-war which\\nshould have arrived.\\n\\nWe remained three weeks at Curacao, during which time the first\\nlieutenant gave me leave to go on shore almost every evening after the\\ncaptain had dismissed his gig, and to remain at Mr Vanderwelt\\'s till\\nhalf-past eight the following morning, when I joined my boat, and\\nattended on the captain.  By this plan my duty was not interfered with,\\nand I had many pleasant meetings with my new friends, and became, as may\\nbe imagined, very intimate with little Minnie.\\n\\nI may as well describe her.  She was about ten years old, tall for her\\nage; she was very fair, with deep blue eyes, and very dark hair; her\\ncountenance was very animated and expressive, and she promised to be a\\nvery handsome woman.  Her father doted upon her, for he had no other\\nchild; he had married late in life, and his wife had died a few days\\nafter Minnie was born.  She was very affectionate in disposition, and\\nvery sweet-tempered; up to the present she had received but little\\neducation, and that was one principal reason for Mr Vanderwelt\\'s\\nwishing to return to Holland.  I soon became as one of the family, and\\ncertainly was treated as such.\\n\\nMinnie was very curious to know what it was that I carried about my neck\\nin the seal-skin pouch, but I never could tell either her or her father\\nwhat it really was.  Mr Vanderwelt very often asked me if I liked being\\nat sea, and I invariably replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nAt last the frigate was to sail, and I had but one more evening to pass\\nwith them.  Mr Vanderwelt appeared very grave, and little Minnie would\\nevery now and then during the evening burst into tears at the idea of\\nour separation.\\n\\nAt last the hour of parting arrived--it was very painful.  I promised to\\nwrite to them, and Mr Vanderwelt told me that his house was always\\nready to receive me, and begged that if I wanted anything I would let\\nhim know.\\n\\nI cried, myself, when I left the house--the first time that I ever\\ncried, I believe, on such an occasion.  The next morning we were again\\nunder weigh, to rejoin the admiral at Jamaica.\\n\\nBob Cross had told me that he wished to have a little talk with me in\\nthe first watch, and I met him on the gangway, our usual rendezvous.\\n\\n\"Master Keene, I have some news for you, which I gained from the steward\\nlast night.  I will say, that his ears are always open; not that I think\\nhe is generally what is called an eavesdropper but he likes you, and\\nwhen you are concerned, he does care to find out what is going on.  Now\\nyou see, sir, that Dutch gentleman whom you saved from the nigger pirate\\ncame to call on Captain Delmar yesterday morning, and, after some\\npalaver, he told the captain that he wished you to remain with him\\naltogether, and leave his majesty\\'s service; and he begged the captain\\nto allow you to be discharged, and then he would be a father to you, as\\nyou had no father.  There was a great deal more which the steward could\\nnot make out, but it was all to that effect.  Well, the captain said\\nthat it was very true that you had lost your father but that he\\nconsidered you as _his own_ son, and could not part with you on any\\naccount; and he stated that you were so promising an officer, that it be\\nvery wrong that you should leave the service, and that it must not be\\nthought of.  The old gentleman said a great deal, and tried very hard to\\npersuade the captain, but it was of no use.  The captain said he would\\nnever let you go till you were a post-captain and commanded a fine\\nfrigate, and then you would of course be your own master, and act as you\\nplease.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad to hear all this, Bob, I can assure you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, it is very good news: but, Master Keene, I only hope, knowing\\nCaptain Delmar as you do, that you will act towards him as if you had\\nnever heard it.\"\\n\\n\"I will, depend upon it, Cross.  As for leaving the service, that I\\nwould not have done even if Captain Delmar had agreed to it.  I\\'m an\\nEnglishman, and I don\\'t want to be under Dutch protection.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, sir--that\\'s right--just as I wished you to feel.  How\\ntime flies away.  Why, Master Keene, you have been afloat nearly three\\nyears.\"\\n\\n\"Within a month, Bob.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'re growing such a tall fellow, they won\\'t keep you much longer\\nin the captain\\'s gig, I expect: I shall be sorry for that.  So Master\\nTommy Dott is in another scrape.\"\\n\\n\"How?--I heard nothing of it.\"\\n\\n\"No, because it\\'s only within this half-hour that he\\'s got in it.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, Mr Culpepper had fallen fast asleep on the gunroom table,\\nunder the skylight, which, as you know, is always open, and his head had\\nfallen back, and his mouth was wide open: there was no other officer in\\nthe gun-room except Mr Culpepper: and Tommy Dott, who perceived him,\\nasked Timothy Jenkins, the maintop-man, to give him a quid of tobacco;\\nwell, Jenkins takes it out of his cheek, red-hot, as you may suppose,\\nand hands it to Master Tommy, who takes his perpendicular very\\naccurately, and drops the quid into the purser\\'s open mouth.\\n\\n\"Mr Culpepper was almost choked, but after a terrible coughing, the\\nquid comes up again; notwithstanding, he turns as sick as a dog, and is\\nobliged to run to the basin in his cabin.  Well, sir, as soon as he\\ncomes out again, he goes up under the half deck, and inquires of the\\nsentry who it was that did it; and the sentry, who is that sulky fellow,\\nMartin, instead of knowing nothing about it, says directly, it was\\nMaster Tommy; and now there\\'s a formal complaint made by Mr Culpepper\\non the quarter-deck, and Master Tommy will get it as sure as a gun.\"\\n\\n\"He don\\'t know how to play a trick,\" replied I; \"he is always found out\\nand punished: the great point is, not to be discovered--that\\'s the real\\npleasure in playing a trick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you certainly do manage well, Master Keene; but I think it\\'s\\nalmost time you left them off now, you\\'re getting an oldster.  Why, you\\nmust be seventeen, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Bob, not very far from it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose I must say Mister Keene for the future.\"\\n\\n\"You may call be what you like, Bob; you have been a good friend to me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I only hope that Captain Delmar will make you a\\npost-captain, as he says, and that you\\'ll get a fine frigate, and I\\'ll\\nbe your coxswain; but that\\'s a long way to look to, and we shan\\'t have\\nany more councils of war on the gangway then.\"\\n\\n\"No; but we may in the cabin, Cross.\"\\n\\n\"A large sail on the starboard bow,\" cried the look-out man forward.\\n\\n\"A large sail on the starboard bow,\" reported the mate of the watch.\\n\\nMy glass was on the capstern, and I ran for it, and went forward to\\nexamine the vessel, although my duty as signal midshipman was ended at\\nsunset.\\n\\n\"What do you make of it, Mr Keene?\" said the officer of the watch.\\n\\n\"I think she is a man-of-war; but it is so dark, that I cannot make her\\nout very clearly.\"\\n\\n\"Is she standing this way?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, under top-sails and top-gallant-sails, I think.\"\\n\\nThe officer of the watch went down to report to the captain, who had not\\nyet turned into his cot.  Captain Delmar had been informed that a Dutch\\nfrigate was expected at the island, but not until the following month;\\nstill we had no reason to suppose that there were any of our frigates\\ndown in these latitudes, except those lying in the harbour at Curacao.\\nThe wind was light, about a three knot breeze, and there being no moon\\ntill after twelve o\\'clock, it was very difficult to make out what she\\nwas.  Some said she was a two-decked vessel.  The captain went down to\\nlook at his private signals for the night, and before he came up I was\\nall ready with the lanterns.\\n\\n\"Two lights over one in a triangle; be quick, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\nThe lights were soon hoisted at the peak, but as they could not well be\\nseen by the other vessel, as we were standing towards her, we went about\\nand hove to across her hawse.  For a quarter of an hour she continued to\\nstand towards us without noticing the signals; at last the captain said,\\n\"They must be all asleep on board of the vessel.\"\\n\\n\"No, Captain Delmar,\" replied I, keeping my telescope on the vessel,\\n\"they are not all asleep, for I saw lights on the main-deck through the\\nbow-ports.  I see them again now.\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said the first lieutenant.\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll beat to quarters, Mr Hippesley,\" rejoined the captain.\\n\\nThe men were summoned to quarters, and hammocks piped up and stowed in a\\nvery short time, the guns cast loose, and every man at his post (but the\\nports not opened), waiting the coming down of the stranger, now about a\\nmile distant, when suddenly she rounded to the wind on the same tack\\nthat we were, and set her royals and flying-jib.\\n\\n\"She does not answer our signals,\" observed the captain: \"I suspect by\\nthat and her present manoeuvre she must be an enemy.\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it, sir,\" observed the first lieutenant; \"an English\\nfrigate would not behave in that way.\"\\n\\n\"Open the ports and get up the fighting lanterns, then,\" said the\\ncaptain; for, up to the present, we had been careful not to show any\\nlights.\\n\\nIt was now plain to see that her men were at their quarters and that she\\nwas prepared for action.  When everything was ready on deck, the royals\\nand flying-jib were set, and we gave chase.  The strange vessel was\\nabout three-quarters of a mile on our weather-beam; in half an hour we\\nhad gained upon her considerably, and our sailing was so superior that\\nwe were satisfied, should she prove an enemy, that in an hour more we\\nshould be engaged.\\n\\nOf course, we might have engaged her at the distance we were from her,\\nbut you cannot be too careful in a night action, and ought never to\\nengage without first hailing the vessel to make sure that she is an\\nenemy, as circumstances may, and have occurred by which an English\\nvessel may not be able to answer the private signal, and, of course, a\\nvessel belonging to a neutral power would be in the same position.\\n\\nThe incertitude which existed as to whether the strange vessel was an\\nenemy or not created great excitement.  My duty, as signal midshipman,\\nplaced me abaft on the quarter-deck, and Bob Cross, who was really a\\nquarter-master, although doing duty as captain\\'s coxswain, was at the\\nwheel.\\n\\nAt last we had brought the chase well on our weather quarter, and when\\nwe tacked we found that we lay well up, she being about a point on our\\nlee bow.  Another half-hour brought us within two cables\\' length of her,\\nwhen we kept away, so as to pass her to leeward, close enough to have\\nthrown a biscuit on board.  The stranger still remaining on the opposite\\ntack, Captain Delmar then hailed from the gangway--\\n\\n\"Ship, a-hoy!\"\\n\\nThere was a death-like silence on board of both vessels, and his voice\\npierced sonorously through the night wind.\\n\\n\"Ah! yaw!\" was the reply.\\n\\n\"What ship is that?\" continued Captain Delmar.\\n\\nDuring this time every man was at his gun; the captains, with the\\nlanyards of the locks in their hands, ready to pour in a broadside.\\n\\nThe reply from the other vessel was--\"Vat chip is dat?\"\\n\\n\"His Britannic Majesty\\'s ship Calliope,\" replied Captain Delmar; and\\nthen he repeated--\"What ship is that?  Let every man lie down at his\\nquarters,\" said Captain Delmar.  The order was hardly obeyed, when the\\nstranger frigate poured in her broadside, and as we were then very\\nclose, with great execution to our hull and rigging: but as the men had\\nbeen lying down, very few of them were hurt.\\n\\nAs soon as the crash was over, Captain Delmar cried out--\"Up, men, and\\nfire, as I round to under her stern.\"\\n\\nIn a few seconds we had passed through the volumes of smoke, and luffed\\nup under her stern: we poured in our whole broadside.\\n\\n\"Let her go off again--flatten in there forward.  Reedy about,\" was the\\nnext order given.\\n\\nWe ran away from her about three cables\\' length, until we had sufficient\\nway to tack, and then we went about and stood towards her, steering for\\nher weather quarter, as if we were going to engage her to windward.\\n\\n\"Over to the larboard guns, my lads.  Hands by, after bracings and\\nhowlings, Mr Hippesley.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir, all ready.\"\\n\\nAs soon as we were near enough, the after-yards were shivered, the jib\\nsheet to windward, and the helm put up.  The Calliope worked\\nbeautifully; she paid sharp off, and we again passed under her stern,\\nand gave another raking broadside; very unexpected on the part of the\\nDutchman, who presumed that we were going to engage him to windward, and\\nhad his men all ready at his larboard guns in consequence.\\n\\nThe Dutch captain was evidently much annoyed: he stood at the taffrail,\\nand, much to our amusement, cried out, in bad English, \"You coward--not\\nfight fair.\"\\n\\nAs we shot ahead of her, to leeward, she gave us a portion of her\\nstarboard broadside: but the men, having been over at the guns on the\\nother side, were not quick enough, and they did us no injury; whereas,\\nher mizzen-mast fell over the side a few minutes after we passed her.\\n\\nShe then raid off, and so did we, so that she might not rake us, and\\nbroadsides were exchanged on equal terms; but before we had exchanged\\nthese broadsides, both ships running with the wind on the quarter, we\\nfound that our superiority in sailing free was so great, that we shot\\nahead of him out of his fire, and we were enabled to luff up and rake\\nhim again.\\n\\nThe last raking broadside brought down his main-topmast and then she was\\nall our own, as Bob Cross said; as she could not round to with no after\\nsail, and we could from our superiority in sailing, take our position as\\nwe pleased, which we did, constantly keeping ahead of him, and raking\\nhim, broadside after broadside, and receiving but one broadside in\\nreturn, until his foremast went by the board, and he had nothing but his\\nmain-mast standing.\\n\\nThis bettered his condition on the whole; as, although hardly manageable\\nwith so little wind, he had more power over his vessel, as far as\\nrounding to the wind, which he did, and the action continued; but our\\nfighting under sail gave us great advantage, and although an occasional\\nshot would come in, and we had to carry some men into the cockpit, for\\none shot we received, we certainly returned ten.  The action had\\ncontinued about an hour, when, by the continual cannonading, the light\\nwind was beaten down, and it fell dead calm.  This put us again upon a\\nmore equal footing, as the Calliope had not steerage way.\\n\\nWe were then about a quarter of a mile apart, lying head and stern; but\\nboth ships had fallen off during the calm, so that only the quarter guns\\nof each could be brought to bear.  The major portion of the ship\\'s\\ncompany being, therefore, not able to use their guns, were employed in\\nrepairing the damages we had received, which were very considerable,\\nespecially in the sails and rigging.\\n\\nI was standing by Bob Cross, who was looking out for cats\\' paws, as we\\ncall slight breaths of wind, when he said in a low voice:--\\n\\n\"Master Keene, I never had an idea that the captain could handle his\\nship so well: he really knows what he\\'s about as well as any man in the\\nservice.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so, too,\" replied I.  \"Whew! there\\'s a nasty shot,\" cried I,\\nas one came in and upset half a dozen of the marines, who were hauling\\nupon the mizzen-topsail sheet, which had just been spliced.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, that chap is made of good stuff, depend upon it--all the\\nDutchmen are: if they could only keep their hands out of their breeches\\npockets, they would be rummer customers than they are now; as it is,\\nthey are not to be played with; and, depend upon it, we\\'re a long way\\noff having him yet: we must pray for wind to come up and he must pray\\nfor the calm to continue.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Mr Keene?\" said the captain, who was on the other side of the\\ndeck.\\n\\n\"Here, sir,\" said I, running up and touching my hat.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, go down quietly and ascertain how many men we have hurt: the\\ndoctor will be able to tell you pretty nearly.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied I, and I dived down below; just as I did so, a\\nshot came in and cut away the lower rail of the copper stanchions which\\nwere round the hatchway, about a foot beyond my hat: had I not gone down\\nso quickly, it would have taken my head off.\\n\\nI went down into the gun-room, for the doctor preferred being there to\\nthe cockpit, as there was so much more room to operate, and I gave him\\nthe captain\\'s message.\\n\\nHe was very busy taking off a poor fellow\\'s leg.  It was a horrible\\nsight and made me sick and faint.  As soon us the bone had been sawed\\noff, he said--\\n\\n\"You will find all the wounded I have dressed in the steerage; those\\nthey have brought me down dead are in the cockpit.  There have been five\\namputations already the master is badly wounded, and Mr Williams the\\nmate, is killed: those whom I have not been able to attend to yet, are\\nhere in the gun-room.  You must ascertain what the captain wishes to\\nknow yourself, Mr Keene.  I cannot, leave a leg with the arteries not\\ntaken up, to count heads.  Mr Rivers, the tenaculum--ease the\\ntourniquet, now.\"\\n\\nAs I felt what the doctor said to be true, I got a lantern and commenced\\nmy examinations.  I found fourteen wounded men waiting the doctor\\'s care\\nin the gun-room, which was almost a pool of blood.  In the steerage\\nthere were nine who had been dressed, and four in their hammocks, who\\nhad undergone amputation of the arm or leg.  I then went down into the\\ncockpit, where I counted eleven of our best men lying dead.  Having\\nobtained the information required, I was proceeding up the cockpit\\nladder, when I turned towards the purser\\'s steward\\'s room, and saw Mr\\nCulpepper, the purser, on his knees before a lantern; he looked very\\npale--he turned round and saw me.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" cried he.\\n\\n\"Nothing, sir; only the captain wishes to know how many men are killed\\nand wounded.\"\\n\\n\"Tell him I do not know: surely he does not want me on deck?\"\\n\\n\"He wants to know how many men are hurt, sir,\" replied I, for I\\nperceived that he thought that the message was sent to him.\\n\\n\"Mercy on me!  Stop a minute, Mr Keene, and I\\'ll send up word by you.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stop, sir,\" replied I, going up the ladder.\\n\\nMr Culpepper would have called me back, but I preferred leaving him in\\nhis error, as I wished to see which he most dreaded, the captain\\'s\\ndispleasure or the shot of the enemy.\\n\\nI returned on deck and made my report.  The captain looked very grave,\\nbut made no reply.\\n\\nI found that the two frigates were now lying stern to stern, and firing\\noccasional guns, which raked fore and aft.  Except the men who worked\\nthe guns aft, our people were lying down at their quarters, by the order\\nof the captain.\\n\\n\"If we only had but a capful of wind,\" said the captain to the first\\nlieutenant, \"but I see no appearance of it.\"\\n\\nI touched my hat and said, \"The moon will rise in about ten minutes,\\nsir, and she often brings the wind up with her.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, Mr Keene, but it\\'s not always the case.  I only hope she\\nwill; if not, I fear we shall lose more of our men.\"\\n\\nThe firing continued, and our main-mast had received so many shots, that\\nwe were obliged to hold it for its support.  While so employed, the moon\\nrose, and the two vessels had now a good view of each other.  I directed\\nmy glass to the horizon under the moon, and was delighted to perceive a\\nblack line, which promised wind; I reported it to the master, and the\\npromise was kept good, for in a quarter of an hour our sails flapped,\\nand then gradually filled.\\n\\n\"She has steerage way, sir,\" reported Bob Cross.\\n\\n\"Thank Heaven for that,\" replied Captain Delmar.  \"Jump up, men.  Brace\\nround the yards, Mr Hippesley.\"\\n\\n\"The enemy\\'s main yard is cut in two in the slings, sir,\" reported I,\\nafter I had my glass upon her.\\n\\n\"Then her last hope is gone,\" replied Mr Hippesley.  \"Haul over the\\nstarboard jib-sheet forward--let her come to, quartermaster.  Larboard\\nguns, my lads.\"\\n\\n\"Now, my men,\" cried Captain Delmar, \"make short work of her.\"\\n\\nThis injunction was obeyed.  We had now a good sight of the enemy, and\\nbrought our whole broadside to bear upon her stern; and after a quarter\\nof an hour more firing I perceived that her ensign was no longer on the\\nstaff, where it had been hoisted after the fall of the mizenmast;\\nneither had she for the last five minutes given us a gun in return.\\n\\n\"She has struck, sir, I think,\" said I to Captain Delmar; \"her ensign is\\ndown.\"\\n\\n\"Pass the word `Cease firing,\\' Mr Hippesley; but let the guns be all\\nreloaded in case of accidents.  Have we a boat that can swim?  Examine\\nthe cutters, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\nI found the cutter on the larboard quarter, with her bottom out: she\\ncould not swim, that was clear.  The starboard one was in better\\ncondition.\\n\\n\"The starboard cutter will float, sir; her gunwale is all torn away, but\\nthere are rollocks enough to pull.\"\\n\\n\"Let her be cleared away and lowered down, Mr Hippesley.  Send for the\\nsecond lieutenant.\"\\n\\n\"I believe he\\'s not on deck sir,\" replied the first lieutenant.\\n\\n\"Not much hurt, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"A splinter, I was told, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Mr Weymss, the third lieutenant?  Mr Weymss, jump into the\\nboat, and take possession of the prize: take as many men as you can;\\nand, Mr Keene, with Mr Weymss, and as soon as you have gained the\\nnecessary information, come back with the boat and two hands.\"\\n\\nI followed the third lieutenant info the boat, and we pulled on board of\\nour antagonist.  A junior officer received us on the deck, and presented\\nhis sword.  His left arm was bound up, and he was very pale from loss of\\nblood.  He spoke pretty good English; and we found that we had captured\\nthe Dort, Dutch frigate, of thirty-eight guns, bound to Curacao, with a\\ndetachment of troops for the garrison, and a considerable quantity of\\nammunition and specie on board for the use of the colony.\\n\\nWe inquired whether the captain was much hurt, as he did not appear on\\ndeck.\\n\\n\"He is dead, gentlemen,\" replied the young officer: \"he was my father.\\nOur loss has been very great.  I am only a cadet, yet I am commanding\\nofficer.\"\\n\\nA tear rolled down his cheek as he said that the captain was his father,\\nand I felt for him.  Shortly afterwards he staggered to a carronade\\nslide, and dropped down on it, and very soon was in a state of\\ninsensibility.\\n\\nThe carnage had been dreadful, and the bulwarks of the vessel had been\\nshattered to pieces.  The scene was almost as had as the Stella\\'s decks\\nbefore she was blown up by the negro captain.  Several of the guns were\\ndismounted and two of them had burst.  I had only time to go round the\\ngun-deck, and then I ordered two hands into the boat, that I might make\\nmy report to Captain Delmar.\\n\\nI asked the third lieutenant to allow me to take on board the young\\nofficer, who still remained lifeless on the carronade slide, and, as it\\nwas proper for me to bring back with me the commanding officer, he\\nconsented.  We lowered him with a rope into the boat, and then I\\nreturned on board of the Calliope, and went up to the captain to make my\\nreport, and present him with the sword of the officer commanding the\\nprize.\\n\\nJust as I was commencing my story, Mr Culpepper came up without his\\nwig, and in a state of great disorder, with a piece of dirty paper in\\nhis hand.  He trembled very much from the effects of his alarm, but made\\na very profound bow, and said to Captain Delmar--\\n\\n\"Here is the state of killed and wounded, Captain Delmar, as far as I\\nhave been able to collect them.  I could not possibly get them\\nascertained before, although I have been an hour or two employed--ever\\nsince Mr Keene came down.\"\\n\\nThe captain, who did not like the interruption, replied very haughtily,\\n\"Mr Culpepper, it\\'s the duty of the surgeon to send in the report of\\nkilled and wounded.  You had better go down below, get your dress in a\\nlittle better order.  Now, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\nOld Culpepper slunk away as I proceeded to give the information, and the\\ncaptain now asked the carpenter if the pinnace was sufficiently\\nrepaired.\\n\\n\"In a few minutes, sir,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\"Mr Hippesley, you must, then, send forty hands on board the prize to\\nrepair her damages, as far as we can.  Mr Weymss must remain on board.\"\\n\\nIn the meantime the young officer had been taken down below to the\\nsurgeon, who had now some leisure to attend to him.  He was soon\\nrestored, and the surgeon expressed his opinion that it would be\\npossible to save his arm.  I went down to see him, and I gave him my\\nhammock to sleep in for the present, and as soon as he was comfortably\\narranged under the half-deck I returned to the quarter-deck, and made\\nmyself as useful as I could, for we had plenty to do on board of our own\\nfrigate, knotting and splicing, having only made temporary repairs.\\n\\nIt was now dawn of day, and very soon afterwards broad daylight.  The\\nmen were ordered aft with the buckets, and the decks, which were smeared\\nand black with powder and the blood of the wounded, were washed down.\\nThat we were all very tired I hardly need say, but it was not yet time\\nfor repose; the magazines had been secured and the fires lighted.\\n\\nAnother boat, with the carpenter and assistant-surgeon, had been sent on\\nboard the prize to remedy any serious damage and to assist in dressing\\nthe wounded.  I was sent with the boat.  Mr Weymss, the third\\nlieutenant, had not been idle: jury-masts were in preparation, the decks\\nhad been cleared, the dead thrown overboard, and the wounded taken\\nbelow.\\n\\nOn mustering the remainder of the Dort\\'s ship\\'s company, and calling\\nover the muster-roll of the troops on board, we found that she had lost\\nthe captain, 2 lieutenants and 10 officers, 73 seamen and 61 soldiers,\\nkilled; and the first-lieutenant, 13 officers, and 137 wounded--147\\nkilled and 151 wounded: total 298.  She had received several shot\\nbetween wind and water, and had a good deal of water in the hold: this\\nwas, however, soon remedied by the carpenter and his crew, and the\\nfrigate pumped out by the prisoners.\\n\\nI returned on board of the Calliope with this intelligence to the\\ncaptain, and found that the surgeon had just sent in the report of our\\nown loss, which was, 1 officer and 17 men killed--master, 2 lieutenants,\\n2 midshipmen, and 47 wounded.\\n\\n\"Do you know who are the midshipmen wounded?\" said the captain to me.\\n\\n\"I heard that Mr James was killed, sir, but not the names of those who\\nare wounded; but I think one of them must be Mr Dott, or we certainly\\nshould have seen him about.\"\\n\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" replied the captain.  \"Sentry, ask who are\\nthe young gentlemen wounded.\"\\n\\nThe sentry replied, \"Mr Castles and Mr Dott.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the captain, \"he\\'ll be in no more mischief for some\\ntime; I heard of his trick to the purser.\"\\n\\nAs the captain was saying this, I perceived the piece of paper which the\\npurser had brought up as his report of killed and wounded lying on the\\ntable with the other reports.  It had, apparently, not been examined by\\nthe captain, but my eye caught it, and I observed, written in a shaking\\nhand, \"Pieces of beef, 10; ditto pork, 19; raisins, 17; marines, 10.\"  I\\ncould not help smiling.\\n\\n\"What are you amused with, Mr Keene, may I ask?\" said the captain,\\nrather gravely.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, for venturing so in your presence,\" replied I;\\n\"but it is Mr Culpepper\\'s report of killed and wounded;\" which I then\\ntook up, and handed to the captain.\\n\\nThis proof of Mr Culpepper\\'s state of mind during the conflict was too\\nmuch for even Captain Delmar, who laughed outright.\\n\\n\"The old fool,\" muttered he.\\n\\n\"You may go now, Mr Keene.  If breakfast is ready, tell Mr Hippesley\\nto let the men have it as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" replied I, and bowing respectfully, I quitted the\\ncabin; for I felt that Captain Delmar thought that he had not been quite\\nso reserved towards me as he always wished to be.\\n\\nAs soon as I had given the captain\\'s orders, I went down to find out\\nTommy Dott.  He was in his hammock, next to mine, in which I had put the\\nyoung Dutch officer.  Dott was wide awake, and, apparently, very\\nfeverish.\\n\\n\"Where are you hurt, Tommy?\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I don\\'t know,\" said he.  \"Get me some water, Keene.\"\\n\\nI got a pannikin of water, and he drank it.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know where you are hurt?\"\\n\\n\"I believe it\\'s my side--somewhere about the body, I know; but I\\'m so\\nstiff all over, that I can\\'t tell exactly where.  Something hit me, and\\nI fell right down the hatchway; that\\'s all I know about it until I found\\nmyself in my hammock.\"\\n\\n\"Well, at all events, you won\\'t be punished now for dropping the quid\\ninto Mr Culpepper\\'s mouth.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Tommy, with a smile, in spite of his pain; \"but I would\\nhave played him a better trick than that if I had had any idea that we\\nshould have been so soon in action.  I wish I could turn round, Keene--I\\nthink I should be easier.\"\\n\\nI turned poor Tommy in his hammock, and then left him.  I looked at the\\nson of the Dutch captain--he was slumbering; he was a very slight youth,\\nwith very beautiful, but very feminine features.  I felt a kindness\\ntowards him, poor fellow; for he had lost his father, and he was about\\nto pass his best years in prison.  But the boatswain\\'s mates piped to\\nbreakfast, and I hastened down into the berth to get my share of the\\ncocoa.\\n\\nAs soon as the men had finished their breakfast, the hands were again\\nturned up, the lower deck cleared and washed, new sails bent and the\\nguns properly secured; screens were put up round the half-deck where the\\nwounded were in their beds.  The dead were brought up and sewed up in\\ntheir hammocks, laid out on gratings, and covered with the ensign and\\nunion jack, preparatory to their being committed to the deep.  Another\\nparty was sent to assist on board of the prize, and the prisoners were\\nbrought on board, and put down in the fore-hold, which had been cleared\\nfor their reception.\\n\\nBy noon everything was so far ready that we were enabled to take the\\nprize in tow, and make sail on the Calliope, after which the men, who\\nwere exhausted, went to dinner, and were permitted to sleep during the\\nremainder of the day until the evening, when the ship\\'s company was\\nordered up, and the dead were committed to the deep blue sea with the\\nusual ceremonies.\\n\\nThe breeze was steady but the water was smooth during the night, and\\nglad I was to throw myself on one of the lockers in the midshipmen\\'s\\nberth, after so many hours of excitement.  I slept till four in the\\nmorning, and finding the planks not quite so soft as they might be, I\\nthen turned into the hammock of the midshipman of the morning watch, and\\nremained till six hells, when Bob Cross came down and told me that the\\ncaptain would soon be on deck.\\n\\n\"Well, Cross,\" said I, as I came on deck and went aft to look at the\\nprize in tow, \"this is a nice business, and our captain will gain a\\ngreat deal of credit.\"\\n\\n\"And he deserves it, Master Keene,\" replied Cross: \"as I said before, I\\nnever had an idea that he could handle his ship so well--no, nor none of\\nthe ship\\'s company.  We all thought Mr Hippesley the best officer of\\nthe two, but we have found out our mistake.  The fact is, Mr Keene,\\nCaptain Delmar wraps himself an in his dignity like a cloak, and there\\'s\\nno making him out, till circumstances oblige him to take it off.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very true, Bob,\" replied I: \"it is only this very morning that\\nhe laughed himself, and I laughed also, and he pulled up immediately\\nafterwards, twice as stiff to me as before.\"\\n\\nI then told Bob of Mr Culpepper\\'s report, which amused him very much.\\n\\n\"I am sure that he is pleased with you, Mr Keene, and I must say that\\nyou were very useful and very active.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know that the carpenter says that we have received injuries that\\ncannot be well repaired without the ship going into dock, and I should\\nnot be surprised if we were to be sent home, if the survey confirms his\\nreport.  I hope we shall; I am tired of the West Indies, and I should\\nlike to see my mother; we have a nice breeze now, and we are two points\\nfree.  If it lasts, we shall be at Jamaica in a fortnight or less.\"\\n\\nThe captain coming on deck put an end to our conversation.\\n\\nBefore night the prize had got up jury-masts, and sail set upon them,\\nand we went through the water more rapidly.  In ten days we arrived at\\nPort Royal with our prize.  The captain went on shore, and what was\\nstill more agreeable, we got rid of all our prisoners and wounded men.\\nA survey, in consequence of the carpenter\\'s report was held upon the\\nCalliope, and the result was, she was ordered home to be repaired.  The\\nDort was commissioned by the admiral, and Mr Hippesley received an\\nacting order to the sloop of war, which had become vacant by the\\ncommander of her being promoted into the Dort, which was now christened\\nthe Curacao.\\n\\nIn ten days after our arrival we were ready, and made sail for Old\\nEngland.  Tommy Dott and the second lieutenant remained on board, and\\nwere both convalescent before we entered the Channel.  Tommy Dott\\'s\\nwound, by the bye, was a splinter in the back, added to severe bruises\\nfrom tumbling down the hatchway.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had shown great kindness to the son of the Dutch captain\\nand he did not send him on shore with the rest of the prisoners, but\\npermitted him to remain, and come home in the Calliope.  He recovered\\nslowly, but was soon out of danger, and was walking about with his arm\\nin a sling long before we arrived in England.  It appeared to me that,\\nduring the passage home, old Culpepper was not so much in the good\\ngraces of Captain Delmar as he used to be; he was, however, more\\nobsequious than ever.  We had a fine run home, and in seven weeks from\\nour leaving Port Royal, we dropped our anchor at Spithead.\\n\\nI may have been wrung, but it certainly did appear to me that as we\\nneared the coast of England, the behaviour of Captain Delmar was more\\nreserved to me (I may say it was harsher) than ever it had been before.\\nHurt at treatment which I felt I did not deserve, I tried to analyse the\\ncause as I walked up and down the deck, and at last I decided that his\\npride was again alarmed.  On the one hand he was returning to his own\\ncountry, to meet with his aristocratical connections, and on the other\\nhe was reminded of my mother, and his _mesalliance_ with her--if such a\\nterm can be used to a woman who had sacrificed herself to one above her\\nin rank.  At all events, I was the result of that connection, and I\\npresumed that he was ashamed of it, and consequently kept me at a\\ndistance, and checked his feelings towards me.  Perhaps he thought that\\nmy mother might be induced to disclose to me that which I had under his\\nown hand-writing, and wore next my heart; or he might consider I was no\\nlonger a boy, but a tall young man, and one who might be induced to\\nclaim his protection.  Such were my reflections, and my resolutions were\\ntaken accordingly--I wanted no Bob Cross to counsel me now.\\n\\nWhen the captain left the ship, I made no request, as did the other\\nmidshipmen, for leave to see my friends; nor even when he returned on\\nboard, which he did several times after the ship had gone into harbour,\\nand was stripping, preparatory to being docked.  One thing, however,\\ngave me great satisfaction, which was, that when the despatch which we\\nbrought home was published, I found my name honourably mentioned in\\nconjunction with other officers, and but three midshipmen were named.\\n\\nWhen the Calliope went into dock the report of the dockyard was very\\nunfavourable.  She required a thorough repair which would take some\\nmonths.  She was therefore ordered to be paid off.  In the mean time the\\ncaptain had gone to London.  During his sojourn at Portsmouth I had\\nnever spoken to him, except on duty, and he had left me without a word\\nof explanation as to his intentions towards me.  As soon, however, as\\nthe order came down for paying off the ship, I received a letter from\\nhim, very cold and stiff, stating that I might, if I pleased, join any\\nother ship, and he would recommend me to the captain; or I might remain\\non the books of the guard-ship, and wait until he commissioned another\\nvessel, when he would be happy to take me with him.\\n\\nMy reply was immediate.  I thanked him for his kindness, and hoped I\\nmight remain on board the guard-ship until he took the command of\\nanother vessel, as I did not wish to sail with any other captain.  I had\\nbeen brought forward by him in the service, and preferred waiting for\\nmonths rather than lose his kind protection.\\n\\nThe only reply to my letter was an order from the Admiralty, for me to\\nbe discharged into the guard-ship when the Calliope was paid off.\\n\\nI hardly need say that I had written and received letters from my\\nmother, who was delighted at my name being mentioned in the despatches;\\nbut I will defer family news till the proper opportunity, as I must\\nfirst tell all that occurred in the Calliope before she was paid off.\\n\\nThe reader will recollect that the son of the Dutch captain, whose name\\nwas Vangilt, had been permitted to come home in the ship, instead of\\nbeing sent to prison.  He and I were very intimate and when I discovered\\nthat he was the cousin of Minnie Vanderwelt, I became more partial to\\nhim.  He was very melancholy during the passage home; how, indeed, could\\nhe be otherwise, with the prospect of being a prisoner during the\\nremainder of the war? and he often expressed his feelings on the\\nsubject.\\n\\n\"Could you not escape?\" said I, one evening.\\n\\n\"I fear not,\" replied he.  \"If once out of prison, I have no doubt but\\nthat I could get a conveyance over the Channel by means of the\\nsmugglers; indeed, I have connections in England who would assist me.\"\\n\\nWhen Captain Delmar went away to town, he had quite forgotten the poor\\nfellow, and Mr Weymss, who was the commanding officer, did not make any\\nspecial report of him as he thought he might defer it till the last\\nmoment, as every day out of prison would be so much gained by young\\nVangilt, who was a general favourite.\\n\\nIn this instance, my regard for the young man made me quite forget my\\nduty as an officer, and the Articles of War.  I knew that I was about to\\ndo wrong; but I considered that, with so many thousand prisoners which\\nwe had in England, one more or less could be of no consequence, and I\\nset to work to see if I could not effect his escape.\\n\\nAfter much cogitation, I found I could do nothing without Bob Cross and\\nI consulted with him.  Bob shook his head, and said it was, he believed,\\nhanging matter; but, after all, it was a pity that such a nice lad\\nshould be peeping between iron bars.  \"Besides,\" continued he, \"he lost\\nhis father in the action, and he ought not to lose his liberty also.\\nWell, Mr Keene, show me how I can help you.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Bob there\\'s a very pretty little girl, who very often comes\\nalongside with the old woman, and you go down into the boat and talk\\nwith her.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Bob, \"that\\'s the little girl I told you of, that\\nused to repeat her fables on my knee.  The fact is, I hope to splice her\\nsome of these days.  It\\'s her mother who is with her, and she will not\\nlet her come on board to mix with the other women, because she is good\\nand modest; too good for me, I\\'m afraid, in one sense of the word.\"\\n\\n\"How do you mean Bob?\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, when I first knew her, she and her mother were living upon\\nwhat they could earn, for the father was killed in action many years\\nago, and I used to help them as far as I could; but now I find that,\\nalthough they are not changed, things are, most confoundedly.  Her uncle\\nlost his wife; he is considered a rich man, and being stone blind, and\\nhaving no one to take care of him after his wife\\'s death, he sent for\\nthis girl and her mother to keep his house and he is very fond of the\\ngirl, and declares that he will leave her all his money, and that she\\nshall marry well.  Now, sir, if she was to marry me, a petty officer\\nonly, it would not be considered that she married well; so you see, sir,\\nthere\\'s a hitch.\"\\n\\n\"Who and what was he?\"\\n\\n\"He was a smuggler, sir, and a very successful one; he has six or seven\\nhouses, all his own property besides the one he lives in himself.  He\\nlives about a quarter of a mile out of Gosport.  I know all about him,\\nalthough I have never seen him.  Soon after he left off smuggling, he\\nlost his eyesight, and, somehow or another, he considered it was a\\njudgment upon him--at least his wife, who had joined the Ranters,\\npersuaded him so--and so he took a religious turn, and now he does\\nnothing but pray, and call himself a poor blind sinner.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Bob, but I do not see why you should give up the girl.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; nor will she or her mother give me up.  I could marry her\\nto-morrow without his consent, but I do not like to do her that injury.\"\\n\\n\"He is stone-blind, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll talk your affair over another time.  What I want at present is,\\nto help this poor young Vangilt to escape.  He says, that if once clear,\\nthe smugglers would put him on the other side of the water.  Now, it\\nappears to me that it would be very easy for him to get out of the ship\\nunperceived, if he were dressed in woman\\'s clothes, so many women are\\ngoing and coming all day long.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, sir, especially on pay-day, when nobody keeps any look-out\\nat all.  I see now, you want some of Mary\\'s clothes for him; they would\\nfit very well.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly; and I think that, as her uncle had been a smuggler, we might\\ngo and consult him as to his escape over the water.  Vangilt will pay\\n100 pounds with pleasure--he told me so.  That will be an introduction\\nfor you as well as for me to the old fellow.\"\\n\\n\"I think we had better let the old fellow suppose it\\'s a woman--don\\'t\\nyou, sir?  But what shall we call ourselves?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I will be a sort of agent for ships, an you shall be a captain.\"\\n\\n\"A captain!  Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; a captain, who has had a ship, and expects another.  Why, you were\\na captain of the fore-top before you were rated coxswain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I must consult Mary and her mother, and then I\\'ll let you\\nknow: they will come this afternoon.  Perhaps in helping Mr Vangilt, I\\nmay help myself.\"\\n\\nThat night Bob Cross told me that Mary and her mother were quite willing\\nto assist, and that they thought it would be a very good introduction to\\nold Waghorn: that we must expect some religious scruples at first, but\\nwe must persevere, and they had no doubt that the old man would contrive\\nto get the young man over to Cherbourg, or some other place on the other\\nside; that we had better call on him in the evening, and they would be\\nout of the way.\\n\\nAs soon as the work was over for the day, Bob Cross and I obtained\\nleave, and set off for Mr Waghorn\\'s house.  We were met by Mary and her\\nmother, who pointed it out to us, and then continued their walk.  We\\nwent to the door, and found the old man smoking his pipe.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" cried he, as we lifted the latch of the gate.\\n\\n\"Friends, sir,\" replied Cross; \"two persons who come to talk on\\nbusiness.\"\\n\\n\"Business!  I\\'ve no business--I\\'ve done with business long ago: I think\\nof nothing but my perishing soul--poor blind worm that I am.\"\\n\\nHe was a very fine-looking old man, although weather-beaten, and his\\nsilver locks hung down on his collar; his beard was not shaved, but\\nclipped with scissors: his want of sight gave him a mournful look.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, sir, I must introduce myself and my friend, the captain,\"\\nreplied I, \"for we want your assistance.\"\\n\\n\"My assistance! poor blind beetle--how can I assist you?\"\\n\\n\"The fact is, sir, that a young woman is very anxious to return to her\\nfriends, on the other side of the water; and knowing that you have\\nacquaintance with those who run to and fro, we thought you might help\\nthe poor young woman to a passage.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s to say, you\\'ve heard that I was a smuggler.  People do say so;\\nbut, gentlemen, I now pay customs and excise--my tea has paid duty, and\\nso has my tobacco; so does everything--the king has his own.  The Bible\\nsays, `Render under Caesar the things which are Caesar\\'s.\\'  Gentlemen, I\\nstand by the Bible.  I am a poor, sinful old wretch--God forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"We ask nothing against the Bible, Mr Waghorn; it\\'s our duty to assist\\nthose who are in distress; it\\'s only a poor young woman.\"\\n\\n\"A poor young woman.  If she\\'s poor, people don\\'t do such work for\\nnothing; besides, it\\'s wrong, gentlemen--I\\'ve given up all that,--I\\'ve a\\nprecious soul to look after, and I can\\'t divert my attention from it.  I\\nwish you good-bye, gentlemen.\"\\n\\nAt this moment Mary and her mother returned, and we rose up.  \"Mrs\\nJames, is that you and Mary?  Here\\'s a captain and his friend come to\\nme; but it\\'s a fool\\'s errand, and so I\\'ve told them.\"\\n\\nI then stated to Mrs James what we had come for, and begged that she\\nwould persuade Mr Waghorn.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Waghorn, why won\\'t you?--it\\'s a good action, and will have\\nits reward in heaven.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but she\\'s a poor young woman, and can\\'t pay her passage, so it\\'s\\nno use.\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" replied I, \"the captain here will become security,\\nthat 100 pounds shall be paid down as soon as she arrives in any part of\\nFrance or Holland.\"\\n\\n\"Will he?  But who\\'s the captain?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t a ship just now, but I expect one soon,\" replied Bob; \"the\\nmoney shall be paid at once, if you will only receive the young woman\\nuntil she can be sent off.\"\\n\\n\"Well let me see--there\\'s James Martin; no he won\\'t do.  There\\'s Will\\nSimpson; yes, that\\'s the man.  Well, it\\'s a good act; and, captain, when\\nwill you bring the money?\"\\n\\nNow the ship was to be paid off on Wednesday and as we had each three\\nyears\\' pay due, there was no difficulty about that; so I replied, \"On\\nWednesday, the captain will give the money to this lady, or whoever\\ncomes with us to receive the young woman; will you not, Captain Cross?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly; the money is ready at an hour\\'s notice,\" replied Bob.\\n\"I\\'m sure that she\\'ll pay me back, if she can; and if she can\\'t, it\\'s of\\nno consequence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, it\\'s a bargain,\" replied the old man.  \"I\\'m a poor blind\\nbeetle, a sinful old soul; I\\'ve nothing to do but to make my peace with\\nHeaven.  It\\'s charity--`Charity covereth a multitude of sins,\\' saith St.\\nPaul.  Recollect 100 pounds--that\\'s the bargain.  I\\'ll send Mrs James\\nto you; you must not call again till she\\'s on the other side of the\\nwater.\"\\n\\n\"Many thanks, sir,\" replied Bob.  \"I won\\'t call till I hear she is safe,\\nand then I\\'ll bring you some tobacco to smoke, such as you don\\'t often\\npick up nowadays.\"\\n\\n\"Happy to see you, Captain Cross, and your friend there,\" replied the\\nold man.\\n\\nWe then took our leave.  Mrs James, after we were gone, praised the\\nappearance of Captain Cross, as such a nice-looking man, and old Waghorn\\nevidently thought well of him by the answer he made.  Mary, however,\\npretended to prefer me.\\n\\nAs soon as I returned on board, I told young Vangilt what I had been\\nabout.  He wrung my hand, and the tears started in his eyes.  \"You, as\\nan officer, are indeed risking much for me.  As to the money, you know\\nme, I trust, too well, not to be sure of receiving it as soon as I can\\nsend it; but I never can repay your kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you may be able to help me one of these days,\" I replied.  \"Who\\nknows?  It\\'s fortune of war, my good fellow; but it\\'s as well not to be\\nseen too much together.\"  So saying, I left him.\\n\\nThe next day, Mrs James came off with the necessary garments and bonnet\\nfor his escape, and they were given me by Bob Cross.  The day after was\\npay-day; and the ship was in such a state of confusion, and there were\\nso many people on board, that there was no difficulty whatever.  Vangilt\\nchanged his clothes in the midshipmen\\'s berth, which was empty, and Bob\\nCross handed him down the side into the boat, where Mrs James waited to\\nreceive him.  Bob and I had both been paid, and we gave her the 100\\npounds for old Waghorn.  The boat shoved off; Vangilt arrived safe at\\nWaghorn\\'s house, where he was kept concealed for eight days, when, for\\nthe sum of 20 pounds, he was safely landed on the French coast, old\\nWaghorn having pocketed 80 pounds by the transaction which, considering\\nhe acted out of pure charity, was a pretty good reward.\\n\\nHaving thus successfully managed, by being guilty of high treason, in\\naiding and abetting the enemy, I bade farewell to Bob Cross, leaving him\\nto follow up his amour, while I went to Chatham to pay my respects to my\\nmother.  I had made up my mind how to act.  I was no longer a child, but\\na man in reflection as well as appearance.\\n\\nI arrived, and hastened to the house from which I had escaped so\\nmysteriously the last time I was in it.  My mother threw herself in my\\narms, embracing me, and then looking at me with surprise and pleasure.\\nThree years and a half had changed me; she hardly knew me, for her\\nassociation of ideas had still pictured me as the smart stripling whom\\nshe had, with so much anguish, consigned into the hands of Bob Cross.\\nShe was proud of me--my adventures, my dangers, my conduct, and my\\nhonourable mention in the Gazette, were all known to her, and she had\\nbeen evidently congratulated by many upon my successful career.  My\\ngrandmother, who had grown much older in appearance, seemed to be\\nsoftened towards me, and I had sense enough to receive her advances with\\ngreat apparent cordiality.  My aunt and the captain were delighted to\\nsee me, and I found that my two cousins, of whose appearance I had been\\nduly apprised, were very pretty children.  I found that my mother had\\ntwo assistants in her business and everything appeared to be on a\\ngrander scale, and more flourishing than ever.\\n\\nThe first two or three days were devoted to narratives, communications,\\nexplanations, and admirations, as is usually the case after so long an\\nabsence; after which we quietly settled down in the relative positions\\nof mother and son, and she assumed, or rather would have assumed, her\\ncontrol over me; but this was not my wish; I had made up my mind that,\\nalthough a clever woman, I must in future control her, and I took the\\nfirst opportunity of a long _tete-a-tete_ to let her know that such was\\nmy intention.\\n\\nSpeaking of Captain Delmar, I at once told her that I knew he was my\\nfather, and that I had his own handwriting to prove it.  She denied it\\nat first; but I told her that all denial was useless, that I had\\npossession of the letter he had written to her upon my supposed death,\\nand that it was no ghost, but I, who had frightened my grandmother.\\n\\nThis was my first blow, and a heavy one, to my poor mother; for what\\nwoman can bear to be humiliated by her offspring being acquainted with\\nher indiscretion?  I loved my mother, and would fain have spared her\\nthis pang, had it not been that all my future plans were based upon this\\none point, and it was necessary she should aid and abet me in them.\\n\\nMy poor mother was bowed to the earth when she found that it was in vain\\nto deny my parentage; she covered her face with her hands in deep shame\\nbefore her child, but I consoled, and caressed, and told her (what I\\nreally felt), that I was indebted to her for not being the son of a\\nprivate marine; that, at all events, I had noble blood in my veins, and\\nwould prove myself worthy of my descent, whether it were acknowledged or\\nnot; but from that hour I took the command over her--from that hour it\\nwas I that dictated, and her authority as a parent was gone for ever.\\nLet it not be imagined that I treated her harshly; on the contrary, I\\nwas more kind, and, before other people, more dutiful than ever I was\\nbefore.  She was my only confidant, and to her only did I explain the\\nreasons of my actions: she was my adviser, but her advice was not that\\nof a parent, but that of an humble, devoted, and attached friend; and\\nduring the remainder of her days this position was never altered.\\n\\nAs soon as my mother had acknowledged the fact there was no longer any\\nreservation on my part.  I told her what was the conduct of Captain\\nDelmar towards me.  I pointed out his checking any display of paternal\\nfeelings towards me, and also the certainty that I had that he was\\npartial to and proud of me.  I explained to her the line of conduct\\nwhich I had pursued, and was determined still to pursue, towards him.\\n\\n\"Percival,\" said my mother, \"I see the judiciousness of what you say and\\nof your behaviour towards him; but allow me to ask you: What is the\\nobject you are aiming at--I mean particularly aiming at?  Of course you\\nhope to obtain advancement from his interest, and perhaps, if he becomes\\nmore attached to you, he may not forget you when he dies; but it appears\\nto me that you have something nearer to your heart than all this--tell\\nme, am I right?\"\\n\\n\"You are, my dear mother; my great end is, that Captain Delmar should\\nacknowledge me as his son.\"\\n\\n\"I fear that he will never do that, Percival; nor, indeed, do I think\\nyou would gain by it.  When you are more advanced in the world, your\\nparentage may be considered as obscure, but still, being born in\\nwedlock, it will be more respectable than the acknowledgment you would\\nseek from Captain Delmar.  You are not aware of the affronts you may\\nmeet with by obtaining what you evidently wish; and once known as the\\nson of Captain Delmar, you may wish that it was never promulgated.\"\\n\\n\"I was born in wedlock, mother, as you say, and as many others are, who\\nnow are peers of the realm, and in virtue of their being born in\\nwedlock, succeed to property to which they would otherwise not be\\nentitled.  Your shame (excuse me for using the word) and my disgrace are\\nequally covered by that wedlock, which is an answer to any accusations\\nof illegitimacy.  As to affronts, I do not fear them, or ever shall,\\nfrom those who know me.  I can defend and protect myself; but it is a\\ngreat difference to me to let the world suppose that I am the son of Ben\\nthe marine, when I know myself to be the son of the future Lord de\\nVersely.  I wish to be acknowledged by Captain Delmar in such a way as\\nto convince the world that such is the fact, without the world being\\nable to throw it up in my face.  That is easily done if Captain Delmar\\nchooses to do it; and if done as it ought to be done, will lead to my\\nbenefit.  At all events, it will satisfy my pride; for I feel that I am\\nnot the son of your husband, but have blood boiling in my veins which\\nwould satisfy the proudest aristocrat.  I prefer the half relation to\\nthat class, such as it is, with all its penalties to being supposed to\\nbe the son of the man whom, from prudential motives alone, you took to\\nbe your husband.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Percival, I cannot blame you; and do not you, therefore, blame\\nyour mother too much, when you consider that the same feeling was the\\ncause of her becoming your mother.\"\\n\\n\"Far from it my dear mother,\" replied I; \"only let us now act in\\nconcert.  I require your assistance.  Allow me to ask you one question--\\nHave you not realised a sufficient sum of money to enable you to retire\\nfrom our business?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly have, my dear Percival, much more than is necessary for me\\nto live in comfort, and I may say, some little luxury; but I have\\nthought of you, and for your sake, every year, have continued to add to\\nmy profits.\"\\n\\n\"Then, my dear mother, for my sake give up your business as soon as\\npossible; money is not my object.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me what your reasons are for this demand.\"\\n\\n\"My dear mother, I will be candid with you.  I wish you to retire from\\nbusiness, and leave this place for any distant part of England; I wish\\nyou to change your name, and, in one word, I wish Captain Delmar should\\nbelieve that you are dead.\"\\n\\n\"An why so, Percival?  I cannot see how that will benefit you; it was on\\nmy account that he took charge of you.  You are not sure that he may not\\nbe severed from you, and who knows but that my supposed death may\\noccasion him to desert you altogether?\"\\n\\n\"You assist my cause, my dear mother, by what you say, if it is on your\\naccount that Captain Delmar is my friend; and if as you say, he might\\ndesert me when you are dead, or supposed to be so, it is evident that\\nhis motive of action must be fear.  You have the secret of my birth,\\nwhich he supposes to be known only to you and to him.  I am convinced\\nthat if you were supposed dead, and that the secret was his own, if he\\nthought that there was no proof whatever against him, he would then not\\ncare showing towards me that regard which he is inclined to feel as a\\nfather, and which is now checked by his pride.  Captain Delmar is\\nnaturally of a kind and affectionate disposition--that I am sure of.\\nYour memory would do more for me than your existence ever can, and as\\nfor the rest, leave that to me.  At all events, if he should, as I do\\nnot believe he will, be inclined to throw me off, I have still his\\nwritten acknowledgment that I am his son, to make use of in case of\\nnecessity.  Now, my dear mother, you must consent to do as I wish.  Give\\nup your business as soon as possible, and retire to another part of the\\ncountry.  When I consider it a proper time to do so, your death shall be\\nmade known to him.  I have no doubt that he will be afloat again in a\\nfew months, and when we are out of England I will bide the proper time.\"\\n\\n\"But your grandmother, Percival--must I tell her?\"\\n\\n\"No; tell her only that you intend to retire from business and go away\\nfrom Chatham; say that you will in future reside in Devonshire, and ask\\nher to accompany you.  Depend upon it she will be pleased with your\\nintentions.  As to what we arrange relative to Captain Delmar, say\\nnothing to her--she hates his very name, and is not likely to talk about\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Percival you will allow me till to-morrow to think about it\\nbefore I give a decided answer.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, my dear mother; I wish you so to do, as I am convinced that\\nyou will agree with me; and I infinitely prefer that you should decide\\non conviction, than be induced by maternal regard.\"\\n\\nAs I was well assured, my mother\\'s decision was favourable to my wishes.\\nShe consulted with my grandmother, who approved of her intentions, and\\nthen it was made public that Mrs Keene intended to retire from\\nbusiness, and that the good-will was to be disposed of along with the\\nstock.  My aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman appeared well content that\\nmy mother should take the step which she proposed.  In short, all the\\nfamily approved of the measure, which is not a very usual circumstance\\nin this world.  I now employed myself in assisting my mother in her\\naffairs.  In a month we found a purchaser of the stock and good-will,\\nand when the sum paid was added to my mother\\'s former accumulations, she\\nfound herself possessed of 12,000 pounds in the Three per Cents, the\\ninterest of which, 360 pounds, was more than sufficient for her living\\ncomfortably in Devonshire, especially as my grandmother had still\\nremaining an income very nearly amounting to 200 pounds per annum.\\n\\nIn another month everything was arranged, and my mother bade farewell to\\nher sister and all her friends, and left Chatham, after having resided\\nthere more than seventeen years.\\n\\nLong before my mother had removed from Chatham I received a letter from\\nyoung Vangilt, announcing his safe arrival in Amsterdam, and enclosing\\nan order to receive the money advanced, from a house in London.  His\\nletter was very grateful, but, as I had cautioned him, not one word was\\nin it which could implicate me, had it fallen into other hands.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that in the hurry of paying off the ship,\\nVangilt was never missed, and although it did occur to the commanding\\nofficer after he had gone on shore that Mr Vangilt had not been sent to\\nprison, he thought it just as well not to raise a question which might\\nget himself into a scrape; in short, nothing was thought or said about\\nit by anybody.\\n\\nA few days before my mother quitted Chatham I went up to London to\\nreceive the money, and then went to Portsmouth to repay the portion\\nbelonging to Bob Cross.  I found that Bob had made good use of his time,\\nand that the old smuggler now received him as a suitor to his niece.\\n\\nAs however, Mary was still very young--not yet seventeen--and Bob had\\nacknowledged that he had not laid by much money as yet, the old man had\\ninsisted that Bob Cross should get another ship, and try a voyage or two\\nmore before he was spliced; and to this arrangement both the mother and\\nMary persuaded him to consent.  I went to call upon them with Bob, and\\ndid all I could, without stating what was not true, to give the old man\\na favourable opinion of Cross.  I even went so far as to say that if he\\ncould not procure another vessel, I was ready to put down a sum of money\\nto assist him; and so I was; and had it been requisite, I have no doubt\\nbut that my mother would have advanced it; but Bob, a fine seaman, not\\nyet thirty years old, was always sure of a ship--that is, a man-of-war.\\nTo save himself from impressment, Cross had dressed himself in long\\ntoggery as a captain of a merchant vessel, and was believed to be such.\\n\\nHaving satisfied myself that everything went on favourably in that\\nquarter, I again returned to Chatham, that I might escort my mother and\\ngrandmother into Devonshire.  We bade farewell to my aunt and Captain\\nBridgeman, and set off for London, where we remained a few days at an\\nhotel, and then took the day coach down to Ilfracombe, where my mother\\nhad decided upon taking up her future residence, changing her name to\\nOgilvie, which had been my grandmother\\'s maiden name.\\n\\nIlfracombe was then a beautiful retired spot, and well suited to my\\nmother from its cheapness: with their joint incomes, my grandmother and\\nshe could command anything they wished.  We soon hired a very pretty\\nlittle cottage _ornee_, ready furnished, as my mother would not furnish\\na house until she had ascertained whether there were no drawbacks to the\\nlocality.  I ought to observe, that my grandmother now appeared quite as\\npartial to me as she had before been otherwise.  I treated her with\\ngreat respect.\\n\\nAlthough it was not difficult to obtain a renewal of leave from a\\nguard-ship, after I had remained six weeks with my mother, it was\\nnecessary that I should make my appearance at Portsmouth.  It was\\narranged that I should take my departure for Portsmouth in three days,\\nwhen, on reading the Plymouth newspaper, I learnt that the\\nnewly-launched frigate Manilla, of 44 guns, was put in commission, and\\nthat the Honourable Captain Delmar had come down and hoisted his\\npennant.  This, of course, changed my plans.  I resolved to set off for\\nPlymouth, and wait upon Captain Delmar.  I wrote to Bob Cross, enclosing\\nan order for my chest and bedding on board of the guard-ship at\\nPortsmouth, acquainting him with my intention, but requesting him not to\\nact until he heard from me again.\\n\\nI had a long conversation with my mother, from whom I obtained a renewal\\nof her promise to abide and act by my instructions.  I took a respectful\\nfarewell of my grandmother, who gave me 100 pounds, which I did not\\nwant, as my mother had given me a similar sum, and then set off for\\nPlymouth.\\n\\nThe reader may perhaps inquire how it was that Captain Delmar--as he had\\npromised to pay my expenses--had not made any offer of the kind, or\\ncommunicated with me on the subject?  But the fact was, that he knew I\\nhad three years\\' pay due, besides the prize-money for the Dutch frigate,\\nwhich, however, I had not yet received, although it was payable.  In\\npecuniary matters I was certainly well off, as my mother desired that I\\nwould draw for any money that I required, feeling convinced that, being\\naware of her circumstances, I should not distress her by any\\nextravagancies in that she did me justice.\\n\\nI was now eighteen years old, and just starting again on my career.  As\\nI grew up, my likeness to Captain Delmar became more remarkable every\\nday.  My mother could not help observing it even to me.  \"I almost wish\\nthat it was not so, my dear mother.  I fear it will be the cause of\\nannoyance to Captain Delmar; but it cannot be helped.  At all events, it\\nmust satisfy him, allowing that he has any doubt (which I am sure he has\\nnot), that I am his own child.\"\\n\\n\"That I believe to be quite unnecessary,\" replied my mother with a deep\\nsigh.\\n\\n\"I should think so too, my dear mother,\" replied I, caressing her\\nkindly.  \"At all events, I will prove, whether I ever obtain it or not,\\nthat I am not unworthy of the name of Delmar: but I must wait no\\nlonger--the coach is about to start.  Adieu, and may God bless you.\"\\n\\nOn my arrival at Plymouth--or Plymouth Dock, as Devonport was then\\ncalled--I inquired at which hotel Captain Delmar had taken up his\\nquarters.  It was the one to which I had intended to have gone myself;\\nbut I immediately had my luggage taken to another, for I really believe\\nthat Delmar would have considered it a great liberty for any one of his\\nofficers to presume, to lie down in the same caravanserai as himself.\\nThe next morning I sent up my name and was admitted.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Mr Keene,\" said the captain.  \"I presume that you have\\ncome down to request to join my ship, and I therefore consent before you\\nmake the request.  I trust you will always show the same zeal and\\ndeference to your officers that you did in the Calliope.  You have grown\\nvery much, and are now a young man.  I shall give you the rating of\\nmate, and I trust you will not do discredit to my patronage.\"\\n\\n\"I trust not, Captain Delmar,\" replied I.  \"I have but one wish in the\\nworld, which is to please you, who have so befriended me from my\\nboyhood.  I should be very ungrateful if I did not do my duty with zeal\\nand fidelity; I am indebted to you for everything, and I am aware I must\\nlook to you for every future prospect.  I have to thank you, sir, for\\nyour great kindness in publishing my name in the public Gazette.\"\\n\\n\"You deserved it, Mr Keene, and it certainly will be of great advantage\\nto you when you have served your time.  Has your time gone on since the\\nCalliope was paid off?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; I am still on the books of the Salvadore?\"\\n\\n\"How much time have you served?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly four years and a half, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the rest will soon be over; and if you do your duty, my patronage\\nshall not be wanting.\"\\n\\nHere there was a bow on my part, and a pause, and I was backing out with\\nanother bow, when the captain said, \"How is your mother, Mr Keene?\"\\n\\n\"She has been advised to retire from business, and to settle in the\\ncountry,\" replied I, mournfully; \"her health is such, that--\" Here I\\nstopped, as I preferred deceiving him by implication, or rather allowing\\nhim to deceive himself.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear that,\" replied he; \"but she never was strong as a\\nyoung woman.\"  Here the captain stopped, as if he had said too much.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"when in the service of Mrs Delmar she could not\\nbe put to anything that required fatigue.\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" replied the captain.  \"You may go on board, Mr Keene, and\\ndesire my clerk to make out a letter, requesting your discharge from the\\nSalvadore into the Manilla.  Do you require anything?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I thank you.  I need not trespass on your generosity just now.\\nGood morning, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon Captain Delmar,\" said I, as I held the door ajar;\\n\"but should you like Robert Cross, your former coxswain, should join you\\nin the same capacity?  I know where he is.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr Keene, I should like to have him: he was a steady, good man.\\nYou will oblige me by writing to him, and requesting him to join\\nimmediately.  Where is he?\"\\n\\n\"At Portsmouth, Captain Delmar.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; tell him to come round as fast as he can.  By the bye, you\\nwill have two of your old messmates--Mr Smith, the master, and Mr\\nDott.  I hope the latter is a little more steady than he was.  I was in\\nhopes to have had your old acquaintance, Mr Culpepper, with us; but he\\ndied about six weeks back--a fit, or something of that kind.\"\\n\\n\"Thank heaven for that,\" thought I.  Again I made my most respectful\\nbow, and quitted the room.\\n\\nI returned to my own hotel, and sitting down, I began to reflect upon\\nthe interview.  I recalled all that had passed, and I made up my mind\\nthat I was right in preparing him for the report of my mother\\'s death:\\nhis reception of me was all that I could have expected from him--it was\\ncordial; but my blood boiled when I called to mind that he had only made\\na casual inquiry after my mother, as I was leaving the room; and then\\nhis checking himself because he had inadvertently said that she was not\\nstrong when she was a young woman.  \"Yes,\" thought I; \"he cannot bear\\nthe remembrance of the connection; and it is only for myself, and not\\nfrom any natural affection of a parent, that he cares for me; or if he\\ndoes care for me as his son, it is because I have his blood in my veins;\\nand he despises and looks down upon the mother.  I am sure that he will\\nbe anything but sorry to hear that my mother is dead, and he shall be\\ngratified.  I will now write to her.\"\\n\\nI could not help observing that there was some change in the appearance\\nof Captain Delmar.  Strange to say, he looked more youthful; and as I\\ncompared our two faces in the mirror on the mantel-piece behind him,\\nwhen I stood up, he appeared more like me in appearance than ever.  What\\nwas it?  \"Oh!\" thought I, \"I have it.  His hair is no longer mixed with\\ngrey: he must wear a wig.\"  This was the fact, as I afterwards\\nascertained; the colour of his wig was, however, much darker than my own\\nhair.\\n\\nBy the same post I wrote to Bob Cross, acquainting him with what had\\npassed, and begging him to come round by the first water conveyance, and\\nbring my chest and bedding with him.  I then walked down to the dockyard\\nto have a look at the Manilla, which was, as I had heard, a splendid\\nvessel; went up again to order a mate\\'s uniform, and returned to the\\nhotel.  It was useless going to the ship at that time, as the marines\\nand boys had only been drafted into her that morning; and there was\\nnothing to do until she was clear of the shipwrights, who were still on\\nboard of her, and employed in every part of her.  The first lieutenant\\nhad not yet come down.  The master was the only officer who had joined,\\nand he had hoisted the pennant.  I was delighted to find that he was to\\nsail with us; and we passed that evening together.\\n\\nDuring the evening the master said, \"I hear there are plenty of good men\\nstowed away by the crimps at different places.  I wish we could only\\nfind out where they are, and get hold of them.  I fear, if we do not, we\\nshall either be badly manned in haste from the Tower tender, or have to\\nwait a long while before we sail.  Now, Keene, don\\'t you think you could\\nmanage so as to get us some men?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got one already,\" replied I: \"Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain.\"\\n\\n\"And a real good one too,\" replied the master; \"the best helmsman we had\\nin the Calliope.  You and he were very thick together.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I: \"when I came on board, a mere lad, he was very kind to\\nme, and I am very partial to him in consequence.\"\\n\\nThat night after the master and I had parted, I thought over the\\nquestion he had put to me, as to obtaining good seamen for the ship, and\\nI made up my mind that I would wait till Cross arrived, and consult with\\nhim as to a project which I had in my head.  In the mean time I went to\\na slop-shop by the dockyard wall, and provided myself with a common\\nsailor\\'s toggery, of the real cut, with a banyan covered hat, and all\\ncomplete.  Three days afterwards Cross joined me, having found a passage\\nround in a cutter; and as soon as I had talked over his affairs, I\\nproposed my plan to him, in which he heartily coincided.\\n\\nThat I did this to please the captain is certain: I had no other view.\\nIt was necessary, however, that I obtained the captain\\'s permission, and\\nI went to him and explained my ideas.  The captain was too willing to\\nlet me try it, and thanked me for my zeal.\\n\\n\"Go on board, Mr Keene, and tell them I have given you six weeks\\' leave\\nof absence, and then you can do as you propose.\"\\n\\nI did so, for it was absolutely necessary that as few as possible should\\nbe acquainted with what I was about, as I ran a great risk.  I have no\\nhesitation in saying that I should have been made away with by the\\ncrimps, had they discovered me.\\n\\nI dressed myself as a common seaman, darkened my face, and dirtied\\nmyself a little, especially on the hands, and Bob Cross and I then went\\nat night into one of the low public houses, with which the town is\\nfilled; there we pretended to be much alarmed lest we should be pressed,\\nand asked for a back-room to smoke and drink in.  We called in the\\nlandlord, telling him we were second mates of vessels, and not secure\\nfrom the impress; that we never were at Plymouth before, our ships\\nhaving put in damaged, and that the crew were discharged; and asked if\\nthere was no safe place where we could be stowed until we could find\\nanother vessel ready to start.\\n\\nHe replied, that there was a house at Stonehouse where we could be quite\\nsafe; but that, of course, we must pay the crimps well for our board and\\nlodging and that they would find us a ship when we wished to go; and\\nfurther, that we must give him something handsome for taking us there.\\nTo this we agreed, and at midnight we set off in company with our\\nlandlord, each of us carrying our bundles, and in less than an hour\\narrived at a sort of farm-house detached from the road.\\n\\nAfter a short parley we obtained entrance, and were taken into a small\\nroom where the crimp inquired of us what money we had, and then told us\\nwhat his charges were.  The reason of his doing this was, because if we\\nhad no money, or very little, he would have disposed of us very soon by\\nsending us on board of some ship, and obtaining an advance of our wages\\nfrom the captain as his indemnification; but if we had plenty of money,\\nhe would then keep us as long as he could that he might make his profit\\nof us; his charges were monstrous, as may be supposed, and we had\\nreplied that we had very little money.  We contrived to look as careless\\nand indifferent as we could, agreed to everything, paid the landlord of\\nthe pothouse a guinea each for taking us to the house, and were then\\nushered into a large room, where we found about twenty seamen sitting at\\na long table, drinking, and playing cards and dominoes.\\n\\nThey did not appear to notice us, they were so busy either playing or\\nlooking on.  Cross called for a pot of ale, and we sat down at the\\nfarther end of the table.\\n\\n\"What a dislike the men must have to the press,\" said Cross to me, \"when\\nthey submit to be mured up here in prison.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and cheated by such a scoundrel as the crimp appears to be.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loud, Jack,\" replied Cross; for I had insisted upon his\\ncalling me Jack, \"lest we should be overheard.\"\\n\\nWe then asked to go to bed, and were shown by the crimp into a room\\nwhich had about fourteen beds in it.\\n\\n\"You may take your choice of those five,\" said he, pointing to five\\nnearest the door: \"I always come up and take away the candle.\"\\n\\nAs we found some of the other beds occupied, we did not resume our\\nconversation, but went to sleep.\\n\\nThe next morning we found that we mustered about thirty-five, many of\\nthe more steady men having gone to bed before we arrived.  After\\nbreakfast, Cross and I each entered into conversation with a man, and\\npumped them very cleverly.  Our chief object was, to ascertain the\\nhouses of the other crimps, and, as the men knew most of them, having\\ninvariably resorted to them at the end of their voyages, we obtained the\\nlocality of five or six, all apparently public-houses, but having back\\npremises for the concealment of seamen: all these were carefully noted\\ndown.\\n\\nAs we became more intimate, the seamen, who were glad to talk, from\\nweariness of confinement, asked us many questions.  We said that we had\\ndeserted from a man-of-war, and then a hundred questions were asked us\\nas to our treatment.  I allowed Bob Cross to be spokesman, and his\\nreplies were very sensible.  He told them that all depended upon what\\nsort of captains and first lieutenants were on board; that he had been\\npressed twice: the first time he was comfortable enough, and made 200\\npounds prize-money in eight months; but in the last man-of-war he was\\nvery uncomfortable, and had therefore cut and run.  Altogether, he made\\nthe service appear much more favourable than they supposed, although the\\ncrimp, who had stood by, did all he could to persuade the men to the\\ncontrary.\\n\\nWe remained in this house for more than a week, and then declared that\\nwe had no more money, and must find a ship.  The crimp said that he had\\na berth for one of us as second mate of a brig, and I agreed to take it,\\nleaving Bob Cross to get a berth for himself as soon as he could.  As I\\nraid up, there was no demand upon the owners of the vessel, and it was\\narranged that I should be down at a certain wharf at three o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, when I should find a boat waiting for me.  I waited up with\\nBob Cross until the clock had struck two, and then the crimp let me out.\\nHe did not offer to go down with me, as he had no money to receive;\\nand, as it was pitch-dark, there was little chance of my being picked up\\nby a press-gang at that hour.  I wished Cross good-bye, and set off for\\nPlymouth Dock with my bundle on my stick.\\n\\nNot knowing where to go at such an hour, I walked about to see if I\\ncould perceive a light in any house: I did so at last through the chinks\\nof the shutters of a small ale-house, and tapped at the door; it was\\nopened, I was ushered in, and the door closed immediately upon me.  I\\nfound myself in the presence of several marines with their side-arms,\\nand seamen with cutlasses.  An officer started up from his seat, and\\ncollaring me said, \"You\\'re just the fellow we want.  We\\'re in luck\\nto-night.\"  In fact, I was in the hands of a press-gang, and I was\\npressed myself.\\n\\n\"Yes, he\\'ll do: he\\'ll make a capital maintop-man,\" said a midshipman,\\ngetting up and surveying me.\\n\\nI looked at him, and perceived my old acquaintance Mr Tommy Dott, grown\\na great deal taller; I perceived that he did not recognise me.  \"But,\\nsir,\" said I to the officer of the party, who was so disguised that I\\ncould not tell his rank, \"suppose I belong to a man-of-war already?\"\\n\\n\"That you do not; or if you do, you must be a deserter, my good fellow;\\nthat is evident by your stick and bundle.  Now sit down and drink some\\nbeer, if you like; you are going to serve in a fine frigate--you may as\\nwell make yourself comfortable, for we shall not go on board yet, for\\nthis hour.\"\\n\\nI determined to keep up my _incognito_, as it amused me.  I sat down,\\nand it then occurred to me that my not going on board of the vessel\\nmight lead to an explanation with the crimp, and that an alarm might be\\ncreated and the men dispersed in consequence.  There were still two\\nhours to daylight, and if I could take up the press-gang, we might\\nsecure all the men in the house before the dawn of day.\\n\\nAs I had just made up my mind to act, there was a stamping of feet\\noutside and a knock at the door.  When it was opened, another portion of\\nthe press-gang, headed by another officer, entered.  I counted heads,\\nand found that they mustered thirty hands--quite sufficient, as they\\nwere armed, to secure all my late companions.  I therefore went up to\\nthe officer, and begged to speak with him aside.\\n\\nI then told him that I had just come from a crimp\\'s house near\\nStonehouse, where I left in their beds thirty-five as fine men as ever\\nwalked a plank, and that, as I was pressed myself, I did not mind\\ntelling him where they were, and he could take them all.\\n\\nThe officer curled up his lip, as if to say, \"You\\'re a pretty scoundrel\\nto betray your companions,\" but immediately resolved to act upon it.\\nWithout stating his intentions, he ordered all the men out, and putting\\nme between two marines, so as to prevent my escaping, I was desired to\\nlead on.  I did so, and we proceeded in silence until we arrived near to\\nthe house.  I then pointed out to the officer that it must be\\nsurrounded, or the men would escape, and that it must be done very\\ncarefully, as there was a large dog which would be sure to give the\\nalarm.  My advice was attended to, and when all the men were at their\\nstations, the whole advanced slowly towards the house.  The dog\\ncommenced baying, as I had foreseen, and shortly afterwards the crimp\\nput his head out of a window, and perceived that the press-gang were\\nbelow.  But all attempts to force an entrance were in vain, every window\\nbelow, and the doors, being secured with iron bars.\\n\\n\"Is there no way of getting into this den?\" said the officer to me.\\n\\n\"Why sir, I\\'ll try.\"\\n\\nAs Bob Cross had given another name, I knew that I risked nothing in\\ncalling out his, and I therefore requested the officer to impose\\nsilence, and when it was obtained, I cried out, \"Bob Cross!  Bob Cross!!\\nWhere\\'s Bob Cross?\"\\n\\nAfter that, I went to the small door at the side of the house, which led\\nto the homestead, and again cried out, \"Bob Cross!--where\\'s Bob Cross?\"\\n\\nI then told the officer that we must wait patiently, and that if it was\\ndaylight before we got in, all the better.\\n\\nAbout ten minutes after that, as I remained at the small door, I heard\\nthe bars quietly removed; I then requested the officer to attempt to\\nforce the small door, and it yielded almost immediately to their\\nefforts.\\n\\n\"Now, sir, leave a guard at the other door, that they may not open it,\\nand escape by it, also five or six hands to catch any who may jump out\\nof the upper windows, and then enter with the rest of your party.\"\\n\\n\"You know what you are about, at all events,\" said he, giving the\\ndirections which I had pointed out, and then entering with the remainder\\nof his party, with the exception of one marine that held me by the arm,\\nwith his bayonet drawn.\\n\\nThe scuffle within was very severe, and lasted for many minutes: at\\nlast, the armed force, although not so numerous, prevailed, and one by\\none, the men were brought out, and taken charge of by the marines, until\\nthe whole of them were discovered in their retreats, and secured.\\n\\nDay now dawned, and it was time to be off.  To make more secure, the\\npressed men were lashed two and two, with small rope, which had been\\nprovided on purpose.  Bob Cross, who, of course, had not mixed in the\\naffray, gave me a nod of recognition, and we set off as fast as the men\\ncould be persuaded to move; certainly not a very gay procession, for\\nalthough the wounds were not dangerous, there was scarcely one of the\\nparty, amounting in all to upwards of sixty men, who was not bleeding.\\nHardly a word was exchanged.  We were all put into the boats, and rowed\\noff to the hulk appropriated to the crew of the frigate, until she was\\nrigged, and as soon as we were on board, we were put below under the\\ncharge of sentries.\\n\\n\"What! you here?\" said some of the pressed men.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I: \"they picked me up as I went to ship myself last\\nnight.\"  The crimp, who had been brought on board with the others, then\\nstarted forward.  \"It is he who has blown upon us; I\\'ll swear to it.\"\\n\\n\"You may swear if you please,\" replied I; \"that will do you no good, and\\nme no harm.\"\\n\\nThe crimp talked with the other men, and then indignation was levelled\\nagainst me.  Most of them swore they would be even with me, and have my\\nlife if they could; indeed, they could hardly be prevented laying hands\\nupon me; but Bob Cross told the sentry, and he interfered with his\\nbayonet; notwithstanding which, fists continued to be shook in my face,\\nand vengeance threatened every minute.\\n\\n\"I told you, my lads,\" said Bob Cross, \"that I have been on board of a\\nman-of-war before this, and you\\'d better mind what you\\'re about, or\\nyou\\'ll repent it; at all events, if one of you touches him, you\\'ll have\\nfive dozen lashes at the gangway before to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\nThis made the poor fellows more quiet; most of them lay down, and tried\\nto sleep off their misery.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you make yourself known, Mr Keene?\" said Cross to me, in a\\nwhisper: \"I saw the master go on the quarterdeck just now.\"\\n\\n\"I think I had better not: there are more houses to examine, and if my\\ntrick was known, it would soon get wind from the women, and I should be\\nwaylaid, and perhaps murdered by the crimps.  The captain will be on\\nboard by ten o\\'clock, I have no doubt, and then I will contrive to see\\nhim, somehow or another.\"\\n\\n\"But you could trust the master--why not see him?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll think of it--but there\\'s no hurry.\"\\n\\nI was afraid that Tommy Dott would have discovered me, and I kept out of\\nhis way as much as I could.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what, sir--as I\\'ve not joined the ship, why not let it be\\nsupposed that I am impressed with the other men, and then I can send for\\nMr Dott and make myself known?  The commanding officer will, of course,\\nsend for me, and I will enter, and then I shall be allowed to go about,\\nand can speak to the captain when he comes on board.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that is not a bad idea.  Talk to the sentry.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s the captain of this ship, sentry?\" said Bob Cross.\\n\\n\"Captain Delmar.\"\\n\\n\"Delmar!--why, he\\'s my old captain.  Did not I see a Mr Dott, a\\nmidshipman?\"\\n\\n\"Yes there is a Mr Dott on board.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I wish you would just pass the word to Mr Dott, to say that one\\nof the pressed men wishes to speak to him.\"\\n\\nThe sentry did so, and Mr Dott came down.\\n\\n\"How d\\'ye do, Mr Dott?\" said Bob Cross, while I turned away.\\n\\n\"What Cross, is that you?  Are you dressed?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, can\\'t be helped.  I\\'m glad I\\'m to sail with you, sir.  What\\'s\\nbecome of Mr Keene?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know; but if he\\'s not hanged by this time, I believe that\\nhe\\'s to join the ship.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t I pull your ears for that?\" thought I.\\n\\n\"What other officers have we of the Calliope, sir?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s the master, Mr Smith, and the surgeon.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Dott, one must always make a virtue of necessity.  Tell Mr\\nSmith that I shall enter for the ship; and I\\'ll put my name down at\\nonce, instead of being penned up here.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s\\n[end of the book]\\n\\nNow you have read it.

So far as the geography, the inhabitants, the animals,\\nand the features of the countries the travellers pass over are\\ndescribed, it is entirely accurate. It gives, in some particulars, a\\nsurvey of nearly the whole field of African discovery, and in this\\nway will often serve to refresh the memory of the reader. The mode\\nof locomotion is, of course, purely imaginary, and the incidents and\\nadventures fictitious. The latter are abundantly amusing, and, in view\\nof the wonderful \"travellers\\' tales\" with which we have been entertained\\nby African explorers, they can scarcely be considered extravagant; while\\nthe ingenuity and invention of the author will be sure to excite the\\nsurprise and the admiration of the reader, who will find M. VERNE\\nas much at home in voyaging through the air as in journeying \"Twenty\\nThousand Leagues under the Seas.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDETAILED CONTENTS.\\n\\n\\nCHAP.

The president, Sir Francis M----, made an important\\ncommunication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently\\ninterrupted by applause.\\n\\nThis rare specimen of eloquence terminated with the following sonorous\\nphrases bubbling over with patriotism:\\n\\n\"England has always marched at the head of nations\" (for, the reader\\nwill observe, the nations always march at the head of each other), \"by\\nthe intrepidity of her explorers in the line of geographical discovery.\"\\n(General assent). \"Dr. Samuel Ferguson, one of her most glorious sons,\\nwill not reflect discredit on his origin.\" (\"No, indeed!\" from all parts\\nof the hall.)\\n\\n\"This attempt, should it succeed\" (\"It will succeed!\"), \"will complete\\nand link together the notions, as yet disjointed, which the world\\nentertains of African cartology\" (vehement applause); \"and, should it\\nfail, it will, at least, remain on record as one of the most daring\\nconceptions of human genius!\" (Tremendous cheering.)\\n\\n\"Huzza! huzza!\" shouted the immense audience, completely electrified by\\nthese inspiring words.\\n\\n\"Huzza for the intrepid Ferguson!\" cried one of the most excitable of\\nthe enthusiastic crowd.\\n\\nThe wildest cheering resounded on all sides; the name of Ferguson was in\\nevery mouth, and we may safely believe that it lost nothing in passing\\nthrough English throats. Indeed, the hall fairly shook with it.\\n\\nAnd there were present, also, those fearless travellers and explorers\\nwhose energetic temperaments had borne them through every quarter of the\\nglobe, many of them grown old and worn out in the service of science.\\nAll had, in some degree, physically or morally, undergone the sorest\\ntrials. They had escaped shipwreck; conflagration; Indian tomahawks and\\nwar-clubs; the fagot and the stake; nay, even the cannibal maws of the\\nSouth Sea Islanders. But still their hearts beat high during Sir Francis\\nM----\\'s address, which certainly was the finest oratorical success that\\nthe Royal Geographical Society of London had yet achieved.\\n\\nBut, in England, enthusiasm does not stop short with mere words. It\\nstrikes off money faster than the dies of the Royal Mint itself. So a\\nsubscription to encourage Dr. Ferguson was voted there and then, and\\nit at once attained the handsome amount of two thousand five hundred\\npounds. The sum was made commensurate with the importance of the\\nenterprise.\\n\\nA member of the Society then inquired of the president whether Dr.\\nFerguson was not to be officially introduced.\\n\\n\"The doctor is at the disposition of the meeting,\" replied Sir Francis.\\n\\n\"Let him come in, then! Bring him in!\" shouted the audience. \"We\\'d like\\nto see a man of such extraordinary daring, face to face!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps this incredible proposition of his is only intended to mystify\\nus,\" growled an apoplectic old admiral.\\n\\n\"Suppose that there should turn out to be no such person as Dr.\\nFerguson?\" exclaimed another voice, with a malicious twang.\\n\\n\"Why, then, we\\'d have to invent one!\" replied a facetious member of this\\ngrave Society.\\n\\n\"Ask Dr. Ferguson to come in,\" was the quiet remark of Sir Francis\\nM----.\\n\\nAnd come in the doctor did, and stood there, quite unmoved by the\\nthunders of applause that greeted his appearance.\\n\\nHe was a man of about forty years of age, of medium height and physique.\\nHis sanguine temperament was disclosed in the deep color of his cheeks.\\nHis countenance was coldly expressive, with regular features, and a\\nlarge nose--one of those noses that resemble the prow of a ship, and\\nstamp the faces of men predestined to accomplish great discoveries.\\nHis eyes, which were gentle and intelligent, rather than bold, lent a\\npeculiar charm to his physiognomy. His arms were long, and his feet were\\nplanted with that solidity which indicates a great pedestrian.\\n\\nA calm gravity seemed to surround the doctor\\'s entire person, and no one\\nwould dream that he could become the agent of any mystification, however\\nharmless.\\n\\nHence, the applause that greeted him at the outset continued until he,\\nwith a friendly gesture, claimed silence on his own behalf. He stepped\\ntoward the seat that had been prepared for him on his presentation,\\nand then, standing erect and motionless, he, with a determined glance,\\npointed his right forefinger upward, and pronounced aloud the single\\nword--\\n\\n\"Excelsior!\"\\n\\nNever had one of Bright\\'s or Cobden\\'s sudden onslaughts, never had\\none of Palmerston\\'s abrupt demands for funds to plate the rocks of the\\nEnglish coast with iron, made such a sensation. Sir Francis M----\\'s\\naddress was completely overshadowed. The doctor had shown himself\\nmoderate, sublime, and self-contained, in one; he had uttered the word\\nof the situation--\\n\\n\"Excelsior!\"\\n\\nThe gouty old admiral who had been finding fault, was completely won\\nover by the singular man before him, and immediately moved the insertion\\nof Dr. Ferguson\\'s speech in \"The Proceedings of the Royal Geographical\\nSociety of London.\"\\n\\nWho, then, was this person, and what was the enterprise that he\\nproposed?\\n\\nFerguson\\'s father, a brave and worthy captain in the English Navy, had\\nassociated his son with him, from the young man\\'s earliest years, in\\nthe perils and adventures of his profession. The fine little fellow, who\\nseemed to have never known the meaning of fear, early revealed a keen\\nand active mind, an investigating intelligence, and a remarkable\\nturn for scientific study; moreover, he disclosed uncommon address in\\nextricating himself from difficulty; he was never perplexed, not even\\nin handling his fork for the first time--an exercise in which children\\ngenerally have so little success.\\n\\nHis fancy kindled early at the recitals he read of daring enterprise and\\nmaritime adventure, and he followed with enthusiasm the discoveries that\\nsignalized the first part of the nineteenth century. He mused over the\\nglory of the Mungo Parks, the Bruces, the Caillies, the Levaillants, and\\nto some extent, I verily believe, of Selkirk (Robinson Crusoe), whom\\nhe considered in no wise inferior to the rest. How many a well-employed\\nhour he passed with that hero on his isle of Juan Fernandez! Often he\\ncriticised the ideas of the shipwrecked sailor, and sometimes discussed\\nhis plans and projects. He would have done differently, in such and such\\na case, or quite as well at least--of that he felt assured. But of one\\nthing he was satisfied, that he never should have left that pleasant\\nisland, where he was as happy as a king without subjects--no, not if\\nthe inducement held out had been promotion to the first lordship in the\\nadmiralty!\\n\\nIt may readily be conjectured whether these tendencies were developed\\nduring a youth of adventure, spent in every nook and corner of the\\nGlobe. Moreover, his father, who was a man of thorough instruction,\\nomitted no opportunity to consolidate this keen intelligence by serious\\nstudies in hydrography, physics, and mechanics, along with a slight\\ntincture of botany, medicine, and astronomy.\\n\\nUpon the death of the estimable captain, Samuel Ferguson, then\\ntwenty-two years of age, had already made his voyage around the world.\\nHe had enlisted in the Bengalese Corps of Engineers, and distinguished\\nhimself in several affairs; but this soldier\\'s life had not exactly\\nsuited him; caring but little for command, he had not been fond of\\nobeying. He, therefore, sent in his resignation, and half botanizing,\\nhalf playing the hunter, he made his way toward the north of the Indian\\nPeninsula, and crossed it from Calcutta to Surat--a mere amateur trip\\nfor him.\\n\\nFrom Surat we see him going over to Australia, and in 1845 participating\\nin Captain Sturt\\'s expedition, which had been sent out to explore the\\nnew Caspian Sea, supposed to exist in the centre of New Holland.\\n\\nSamuel Ferguson returned to England about 1850, and, more than ever\\npossessed by the demon of discovery, he spent the intervening time,\\nuntil 1853, in accompanying Captain McClure on the expedition that went\\naround the American Continent from Behring\\'s Straits to Cape Farewell.\\n\\nNotwithstanding fatigues of every description, and in all climates,\\nFerguson\\'s constitution continued marvellously sound. He felt at ease in\\nthe midst of the most complete privations; in fine, he was the very\\ntype of the thoroughly accomplished explorer whose stomach expands or\\ncontracts at will; whose limbs grow longer or shorter according to\\nthe resting-place that each stage of a journey may bring; who can fall\\nasleep at any hour of the day or awake at any hour of the night.\\n\\nNothing, then, was less surprising, after that, than to find our\\ntraveller, in the period from 1855 to 1857, visiting the whole region\\nwest of the Thibet, in company with the brothers Schlagintweit,\\nand bringing back some curious ethnographic observations from that\\nexpedition.\\n\\nDuring these different journeys, Ferguson had been the most active and\\ninteresting correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, the penny newspaper\\nwhose circulation amounts to 140,000 copies, and yet scarcely suffices\\nfor its many legions of readers. Thus, the doctor had become well known\\nto the public, although he could not claim membership in either of the\\nRoyal Geographical Societies of London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, or\\nSt. Petersburg, or yet with the Travellers\\' Club, or even the Royal\\nPolytechnic Institute, where his friend the statistician Cockburn ruled\\nin state.\\n\\nThe latter savant had, one day, gone so far as to propose to him the\\nfollowing problem: Given the number of miles travelled by the doctor in\\nmaking the circuit of the Globe, how many more had his head described\\nthan his feet, by reason of the different lengths of the radii?--or,\\nthe number of miles traversed by the doctor\\'s head and feet respectively\\nbeing given, required the exact height of that gentleman?\\n\\nThis was done with the idea of complimenting him, but the doctor had\\nheld himself aloof from all the learned bodies--belonging, as he did, to\\nthe church militant and not to the church polemical. He found his time\\nbetter employed in seeking than in discussing, in discovering rather\\nthan discoursing.\\n\\nThere is a story told of an Englishman who came one day to Geneva,\\nintending to visit the lake. He was placed in one of those odd vehicles\\nin which the passengers sit side by side, as they do in an omnibus.\\nWell, it so happened that the Englishman got a seat that left him with\\nhis back turned toward the lake. The vehicle completed its circular trip\\nwithout his thinking to turn around once, and he went back to London\\ndelighted with the Lake of Geneva.\\n\\nDoctor Ferguson, however, had turned around to look about him on his\\njourneyings, and turned to such good purpose that he had seen a great\\ndeal. In doing so, he had simply obeyed the laws of his nature, and we\\nhave good reason to believe that he was, to some extent, a fatalist,\\nbut of an orthodox school of fatalism withal, that led him to rely\\nupon himself and even upon Providence. He claimed that he was impelled,\\nrather than drawn by his own volition, to journey as he did, and that he\\ntraversed the world like the locomotive, which does not direct itself,\\nbut is guided and directed by the track it runs on.\\n\\n\"I do not follow my route;\" he often said, \"it is my route that follows\\nme.\"\\n\\nThe reader will not be surprised, then, at the calmness with which the\\ndoctor received the applause that welcomed him in the Royal Society. He\\nwas above all such trifles, having no pride, and less vanity. He\\nlooked upon the proposition addressed to him by Sir Francis M----as the\\nsimplest thing in the world, and scarcely noticed the immense effect\\nthat it produced.\\n\\nWhen the session closed, the doctor was escorted to the rooms of the\\nTravellers\\' Club, in Pall Mall. A superb entertainment had been prepared\\nthere in his honor. The dimensions of the dishes served were made to\\ncorrespond with the importance of the personage entertained, and the\\nboiled sturgeon that figured at this magnificent repast was not an inch\\nshorter than Dr. Ferguson himself.\\n\\nNumerous toasts were offered and quaffed, in the wines of France, to\\nthe celebrated travellers who had made their names illustrious by their\\nexplorations of African territory. The guests drank to their health or\\nto their memory, in alphabetical order, a good old English way of doing\\nthe thing. Among those remembered thus, were: Abbadie, Adams, Adamson,\\nAnderson, Arnaud, Baikie, Baldwin, Barth, Batouda, Beke, Beltram, Du\\nBerba, Bimbachi, Bolognesi, Bolwik, Belzoni, Bonnemain, Brisson, Browne,\\nBruce, Brun-Rollet, Burchell, Burckhardt, Burton, Cailland, Caillie,\\nCampbell, Chapman, Clapperton, Clot-Bey, Colomieu, Courval, Cumming,\\nCuny, Debono, Decken, Denham, Desavanchers, Dicksen, Dickson, Dochard,\\nDu Chaillu, Duncan, Durand, Duroule, Duveyrier, D\\'Escayrac, De Lauture,\\nErhardt, Ferret, Fresnel, Galinier, Galton, Geoffroy, Golberry,\\nHahn, Halm, Harnier, Hecquart, Heuglin, Hornemann, Houghton, Imbert,\\nKauffmann, Knoblecher, Krapf, Kummer, Lafargue, Laing, Lafaille,\\nLambert, Lamiral, Lampriere, John Lander, Richard Lander, Lefebvre,\\nLejean, Levaillant, Livingstone, MacCarthy, Maggiar, Maizan, Malzac,\\nMoffat, Mollien, Monteiro, Morrison, Mungo Park, Neimans, Overweg,\\nPanet, Partarrieau, Pascal, Pearse, Peddie, Penney, Petherick, Poncet,\\nPrax, Raffenel, Rabh, Rebmann, Richardson, Riley, Ritchey, Rochet\\nd\\'Hericourt, Rongawi, Roscher, Ruppel, Saugnier, Speke, Steidner,\\nThibaud, Thompson, Thornton, Toole, Tousny, Trotter, Tuckey, Tyrwhitt,\\nVaudey, Veyssiere, Vincent, Vinco, Vogel, Wahlberg, Warrington,\\nWashington, Werne, Wild, and last, but not least, Dr. Ferguson, who,\\nby his incredible attempt, was to link together the achievements of all\\nthese explorers, and complete the series of African discovery.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SECOND.\\n\\nThe Article in the Daily Telegraph.--War between the Scientific\\nJournals.--Mr. Petermann backs his Friend Dr. Ferguson.--Reply of the\\nSavant Koner.--Bets made.--Sundry Propositions offered to the Doctor.\\n\\nOn the next day, in its number of January 15th, the Daily Telegraph\\npublished an article couched in the following terms:\\n\\n\"Africa is, at length, about to surrender the secret of her vast\\nsolitudes; a modern OEdipus is to give us the key to that enigma which\\nthe learned men of sixty centuries have not been able to decipher. In\\nother days, to seek the sources of the Nile--fontes Nili quoerere--was\\nregarded as a mad endeavor, a chimera that could not be realized.\\n\\n\"Dr. Barth, in following out to Soudan the track traced by Denham and\\nClapperton; Dr. Livingstone, in multiplying his fearless explorations\\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the basin of the Zambesi; Captains Burton\\nand Speke, in the discovery of the great interior lakes, have opened\\nthree highways to modern civilization. THEIR POINT OF INTERSECTION,\\nwhich no traveller has yet been able to reach, is the very heart of\\nAfrica, and it is thither that all efforts should now be directed.\\n\\n\"The labors of these hardy pioneers of science are now about to be\\nknit together by the daring project of Dr. Samuel Ferguson, whose\\nfine explorations our readers have frequently had the opportunity of\\nappreciating.\\n\\n\"This intrepid discoverer proposes to traverse all Africa from east to\\nwest IN A BALLOON. If we are well informed, the point of departure\\nfor this surprising journey is to be the island of Zanzibar, upon\\nthe eastern coast. As for the point of arrival, it is reserved for\\nProvidence alone to designate.\\n\\n\"The proposal for this scientific undertaking was officially made,\\nyesterday, at the rooms of the Royal Geographical Society, and the sum\\nof twenty-five hundred pounds was voted to defray the expenses of the\\nenterprise.\\n\\n\"We shall keep our readers informed as to the progress of this\\nenterprise, which has no precedent in the annals of exploration.\"\\n\\nAs may be supposed, the foregoing article had an enormous echo among\\nscientific people. At first, it stirred up a storm of incredulity; Dr.\\nFerguson passed for a purely chimerical personage of the Barnum stamp,\\nwho, after having gone through the United States, proposed to \"do\" the\\nBritish Isles.\\n\\nA humorous reply appeared in the February number of the Bulletins de la\\nSociete Geographique of Geneva, which very wittily showed up the Royal\\nSociety of London and their phenomenal sturgeon.\\n\\nBut Herr Petermann, in his Mittheilungen, published at Gotha, reduced\\nthe Geneva journal to the most absolute silence. Herr Petermann knew\\nDr. Ferguson personally, and guaranteed the intrepidity of his dauntless\\nfriend.\\n\\nBesides, all manner of doubt was quickly put out of the question:\\npreparations for the trip were set on foot at London; the factories of\\nLyons received a heavy order for the silk required for the body of the\\nballoon; and, finally, the British Government placed the transport-ship\\nResolute, Captain Bennett, at the disposal of the expedition.\\n\\nAt once, upon word of all this, a thousand encouragements were offered,\\nand felicitations came pouring in from all quarters. The details of the\\nundertaking were published in full in the bulletins of the Geographical\\nSociety of Paris; a remarkable article appeared in the Nouvelles Annales\\ndes Voyages, de la Geographie, de l\\'Histoire, et de l\\'Archaeologie de\\nM. V. A. Malte-Brun (\"New Annals of Travels, Geography, History, and\\nArchaeology, by M. V. A. Malte-Brun\"); and a searching essay in the\\nZeitschrift fur Allgemeine Erdkunde, by Dr. W. Koner, triumphantly\\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the journey, its chances of success, the\\nnature of the obstacles existing, the immense advantages of the aerial\\nmode of locomotion, and found fault with nothing but the selected point\\nof departure, which it contended should be Massowah, a small port in\\nAbyssinia, whence James Bruce, in 1768, started upon his explorations\\nin search of the sources of the Nile. Apart from that, it mentioned, in\\nterms of unreserved admiration, the energetic character of Dr. Ferguson,\\nand the heart, thrice panoplied in bronze, that could conceive and\\nundertake such an enterprise.\\n\\nThe North American Review could not, without some displeasure,\\ncontemplate so much glory monopolized by England. It therefore rather\\nridiculed the doctor\\'s scheme, and urged him, by all means, to push his\\nexplorations as far as America, while he was about it.\\n\\nIn a word, without going over all the journals in the world, there was\\nnot a scientific publication, from the Journal of Evangelical Missions\\nto the Revue Algerienne et Coloniale, from the Annales de la Propagation\\nde la Foi to the Church Missionary Intelligencer, that had not something\\nto say about the affair in all its phases.\\n\\nMany large bets were made at London and throughout England generally,\\nfirst, as to the real or supposititious existence of Dr. Ferguson;\\nsecondly, as to the trip itself, which, some contended, would not be\\nundertaken at all, and which was really contemplated, according to\\nothers; thirdly, upon the success or failure of the enterprise;\\nand fourthly, upon the probabilities of Dr. Ferguson\\'s return. The\\nbetting-books were covered with entries of immense sums, as though the\\nEpsom races were at stake.\\n\\nThus, believers and unbelievers, the learned and the ignorant, alike\\nhad their eyes fixed on the doctor, and he became the lion of the day,\\nwithout knowing that he carried such a mane. On his part, he willingly\\ngave the most accurate information touching his project. He was very\\neasily approached, being naturally the most affable man in the world.\\nMore than one bold adventurer presented himself, offering to share the\\ndangers as well as the glory of the undertaking; but he refused them\\nall, without giving his reasons for rejecting them.\\n\\nNumerous inventors of mechanism applicable to the guidance of balloons\\ncame to propose their systems, but he would accept none; and, when\\nhe was asked whether he had discovered something of his own for that\\npurpose, he constantly refused to give any explanation, and merely\\nbusied himself more actively than ever with the preparations for his\\njourney.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRD.\\n\\nThe Doctor\\'s Friend.--The Origin of their Friendship.--Dick Kennedy at\\nLondon.--An unexpected but not very consoling Proposal.--A Proverb by\\nno means cheering.--A few Names from the African Martyrology.--The\\nAdvantages of a Balloon.--Dr. Ferguson\\'s Secret.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson had a friend--not another self, indeed, an alter ego, for\\nfriendship could not exist between two beings exactly alike.\\n\\nBut, if they possessed different qualities, aptitudes, and temperaments,\\nDick Kennedy and Samuel Ferguson lived with one and the same heart, and\\nthat gave them no great trouble. In fact, quite the reverse.\\n\\nDick Kennedy was a Scotchman, in the full acceptation of the word--open,\\nresolute, and headstrong. He lived in the town of Leith, which is near\\nEdinburgh, and, in truth, is a mere suburb of Auld Reekie. Sometimes he\\nwas a fisherman, but he was always and everywhere a determined hunter,\\nand that was nothing remarkable for a son of Caledonia, who had known\\nsome little climbing among the Highland mountains. He was cited as a\\nwonderful shot with the rifle, since not only could he split a bullet\\non a knife-blade, but he could divide it into two such equal parts that,\\nupon weighing them, scarcely any difference would be perceptible.\\n\\nKennedy\\'s countenance strikingly recalled that of Herbert Glendinning,\\nas Sir Walter Scott has depicted it in \"The Monastery\"; his stature was\\nabove six feet; full of grace and easy movement, he yet seemed gifted\\nwith herculean strength; a face embrowned by the sun; eyes keen and\\nblack; a natural air of daring courage; in fine, something sound, solid,\\nand reliable in his entire person, spoke, at first glance, in favor of\\nthe bonny Scot.\\n\\nThe acquaintanceship of these two friends had been formed in India, when\\nthey belonged to the same regiment. While Dick would be out in pursuit\\nof the tiger and the elephant, Samuel would be in search of plants and\\ninsects. Each could call himself expert in his own province, and more\\nthan one rare botanical specimen, that to science was as great a victory\\nwon as the conquest of a pair of ivory tusks, became the doctor\\'s booty.\\n\\nThese two young men, moreover, never had occasion to save each other\\'s\\nlives, or to render any reciprocal service. Hence, an unalterable\\nfriendship. Destiny sometimes bore them apart, but sympathy always\\nunited them again.\\n\\nSince their return to England they had been frequently separated by\\nthe doctor\\'s distant expeditions; but, on his return, the latter never\\nfailed to go, not to ASK for hospitality, but to bestow some weeks of\\nhis presence at the home of his crony Dick.\\n\\nThe Scot talked of the past; the doctor busily prepared for the future.\\nThe one looked back, the other forward. Hence, a restless spirit\\npersonified in Ferguson; perfect calmness typified in Kennedy--such was\\nthe contrast.\\n\\nAfter his journey to the Thibet, the doctor had remained nearly two\\nyears without hinting at new explorations; and Dick, supposing that his\\nfriend\\'s instinct for travel and thirst for adventure had at length died\\nout, was perfectly enchanted. They would have ended badly, some day or\\nother, he thought to himself; no matter what experience one has with\\nmen, one does not travel always with impunity among cannibals and wild\\nbeasts. So, Kennedy besought the doctor to tie up his bark for life,\\nhaving done enough for science, and too much for the gratitude of men.\\n\\nThe doctor contented himself with making no reply to this. He\\nremained absorbed in his own reflections, giving himself up to secret\\ncalculations, passing his nights among heaps of figures, and making\\nexperiments with the strangest-looking machinery, inexplicable to\\neverybody but himself. It could readily be guessed, though, that some\\ngreat thought was fermenting in his brain.\\n\\n\"What can he have been planning?\" wondered Kennedy, when, in the month\\nof January, his friend quitted him to return to London.\\n\\nHe found out one morning when he looked into the Daily Telegraph.\\n\\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"the lunatic! the madman! Cross Africa\\nin a balloon! Nothing but that was wanted to cap the climax! That\\'s what\\nhe\\'s been bothering his wits about these two years past!\"\\n\\nNow, reader, substitute for all these exclamation points, as many\\nringing thumps with a brawny fist upon the table, and you have some idea\\nof the manual exercise that Dick went through while he thus spoke.\\n\\nWhen his confidential maid-of-all-work, the aged Elspeth, tried to\\ninsinuate that the whole thing might be a hoax--\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it!\" said he. \"Don\\'t I know my man? Isn\\'t it just like\\nhim? Travel through the air! There, now, he\\'s jealous of the eagles,\\nnext! No! I warrant you, he\\'ll not do it! I\\'ll find a way to stop him!\\nHe! why if they\\'d let him alone, he\\'d start some day for the moon!\"\\n\\nOn that very evening Kennedy, half alarmed, and half exasperated, took\\nthe train for London, where he arrived next morning.\\n\\nThree-quarters of an hour later a cab deposited him at the door of the\\ndoctor\\'s modest dwelling, in Soho Square, Greek Street. Forthwith he\\nbounded up the steps and announced his arrival with five good, hearty,\\nsounding raps at the door.\\n\\nFerguson opened, in person.\\n\\n\"Dick! you here?\" he exclaimed, but with no great expression of\\nsurprise, after all.\\n\\n\"Dick himself!\" was the response.\\n\\n\"What, my dear boy, you at London, and this the mid-season of the winter\\nshooting?\"\\n\\n\"Yes! here I am, at London!\"\\n\\n\"And what have you come to town for?\"\\n\\n\"To prevent the greatest piece of folly that ever was conceived.\"\\n\\n\"Folly!\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"Is what this paper says, the truth?\" rejoined Kennedy, holding out the\\ncopy of the Daily Telegraph, mentioned above.\\n\\n\"Ah! that\\'s what you mean, is it? These newspapers are great tattlers!\\nBut, sit down, my dear Dick.\"\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t sit down!--Then, you really intend to attempt this\\njourney?\"\\n\\n\"Most certainly! all my preparations are getting along finely, and I--\"\\n\\n\"Where are your traps? Let me have a chance at them! I\\'ll make them fly!\\nI\\'ll put your preparations in fine order.\" And so saying, the gallant\\nScot gave way to a genuine explosion of wrath.\\n\\n\"Come, be calm, my dear Dick!\" resumed the doctor. \"You\\'re angry at me\\nbecause I did not acquaint you with my new project.\"\\n\\n\"He calls this his new project!\"\\n\\n\"I have been very busy,\" the doctor went on, without heeding the\\ninterruption; \"I have had so much to look after! But rest assured that I\\nshould not have started without writing to you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed! I\\'m highly honored.\"\\n\\n\"Because it is my intention to take you with me.\"\\n\\nUpon this, the Scotchman gave a leap that a wild goat would not have\\nbeen ashamed of among his native crags.\\n\\n\"Ah! really, then, you want them to send us both to Bedlam!\"\\n\\n\"I have counted positively upon you, my dear Dick, and I have picked you\\nout from all the rest.\"\\n\\nKennedy stood speechless with amazement.\\n\\n\"After listening to me for ten minutes,\" said the doctor, \"you will\\nthank me!\"\\n\\n\"Are you speaking seriously?\"\\n\\n\"Very seriously.\"\\n\\n\"And suppose that I refuse to go with you?\"\\n\\n\"But you won\\'t refuse.\"\\n\\n\"But, suppose that I were to refuse?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d go alone.\"\\n\\n\"Let us sit down,\" said Kennedy, \"and talk without excitement. The\\nmoment you give up jesting about it, we can discuss the thing.\"\\n\\n\"Let us discuss it, then, at breakfast, if you have no objections, my\\ndear Dick.\"\\n\\nThe two friends took their seats opposite to each other, at a little\\ntable with a plate of toast and a huge tea-urn before them.\\n\\n\"My dear Samuel,\" said the sportsman, \"your project is insane! it\\nis impossible! it has no resemblance to anything reasonable or\\npracticable!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s for us to find out when we shall have tried it!\"\\n\\n\"But trying it is exactly what you ought not to attempt.\"\\n\\n\"Why so, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Well, the risks, the difficulty of the thing.\"\\n\\n\"As for difficulties,\" replied Ferguson, in a serious tone, \"they were\\nmade to be overcome; as for risks and dangers, who can flatter himself\\nthat he is to escape them? Every thing in life involves danger; it may\\neven be dangerous to sit down at one\\'s own table, or to put one\\'s hat on\\none\\'s own head. Moreover, we must look upon what is to occur as having\\nalready occurred, and see nothing but the present in the future, for the\\nfuture is but the present a little farther on.\"\\n\\n\"There it is!\" exclaimed Kennedy, with a shrug. \"As great a fatalist as\\never!\"\\n\\n\"Yes! but in the good sense of the word. Let us not trouble ourselves,\\nthen, about what fate has in store for us, and let us not forget our\\ngood old English proverb: \\'The man who was born to be hung will never be\\ndrowned!\\'\"\\n\\nThere was no reply to make, but that did not prevent Kennedy from\\nresuming a series of arguments which may be readily conjectured, but\\nwhich were too long for us to repeat.\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" he said, after an hour\\'s discussion, \"if you are\\nabsolutely determined to make this trip across the African continent--if\\nit is necessary for your happiness, why not pursue the ordinary routes?\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" ejaculated the doctor, growing animated. \"Because, all attempts\\nto do so, up to this time, have utterly failed. Because, from Mungo\\nPark, assassinated on the Niger, to Vogel, who disappeared in the\\nWadai country; from Oudney, who died at Murmur, and Clapperton, lost\\nat Sackatou, to the Frenchman Maizan, who was cut to pieces; from Major\\nLaing, killed by the Touaregs, to Roscher, from Hamburg, massacred\\nin the beginning of 1860, the names of victim after victim have been\\ninscribed on the lists of African martyrdom! Because, to contend\\nsuccessfully against the elements; against hunger, and thirst, and\\nfever; against savage beasts, and still more savage men, is impossible!\\nBecause, what cannot be done in one way, should be tried in another. In\\nfine, because what one cannot pass through directly in the middle, must\\nbe passed by going to one side or overhead!\"\\n\\n\"If passing over it were the only question!\" interposed Kennedy; \"but\\npassing high up in the air, doctor, there\\'s the rub!\"\\n\\n\"Come, then,\" said the doctor, \"what have I to fear? You will admit\\nthat I have taken my precautions in such manner as to be certain that\\nmy balloon will not fall; but, should it disappoint me, I should\\nfind myself on the ground in the normal conditions imposed upon other\\nexplorers. But, my balloon will not deceive me, and we need make no such\\ncalculations.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but you must take them into view.\"\\n\\n\"No, Dick. I intend not to be separated from the balloon until I reach\\nthe western coast of Africa. With it, every thing is possible; without\\nit, I fall back into the dangers and difficulties as well as the natural\\nobstacles that ordinarily attend such an expedition: with it, neither\\nheat, nor torrents, nor tempests, nor the simoom, nor unhealthy\\nclimates, nor wild animals, nor savage men, are to be feared! If I feel\\ntoo hot, I can ascend; if too cold, I can come down. Should there be\\na mountain, I can pass over it; a precipice, I can sweep across it;\\na river, I can sail beyond it; a storm, I can rise away above it; a\\ntorrent, I can skim it like a bird! I can advance without fatigue, I can\\nhalt without need of repose! I can soar above the nascent cities! I can\\nspeed onward with the rapidity of a tornado, sometimes at the loftiest\\nheights, sometimes only a hundred feet above the soil, while the map of\\nAfrica unrolls itself beneath my gaze in the great atlas of the world.\"\\n\\nEven the stubborn Kennedy began to feel moved, and yet the spectacle\\nthus conjured up before him gave him the vertigo. He riveted his eyes\\nupon the doctor with wonder and admiration, and yet with fear, for he\\nalready felt himself swinging aloft in space.\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" said he, at last. \"Let us see, Samuel. Then you have\\ndiscovered the means of guiding a balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Not by any means. That is a Utopian idea.\"\\n\\n\"Then, you will go--\"\\n\\n\"Whithersoever Providence wills; but, at all events, from east to west.\"\\n\\n\"Why so?\"\\n\\n\"Because I expect to avail myself of the trade-winds, the direction of\\nwhich is always the same.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! yes, indeed!\" said Kennedy, reflecting; \"the\\ntrade-winds--yes--truly--one might--there\\'s something in that!\"\\n\\n\"Something in it--yes, my excellent friend--there\\'s EVERY THING in it.\\nThe English Government has placed a transport at my disposal, and three\\nor four vessels are to cruise off the western coast of Africa, about the\\npresumed period of my arrival. In three months, at most, I shall be at\\nZanzibar, where I will inflate my balloon, and from that point we shall\\nlaunch ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"We!\" said Dick.\\n\\n\"Have you still a shadow of an objection to offer? Speak, friend\\nKennedy.\"\\n\\n\"An objection! I have a thousand; but among other things, tell me, if\\nyou expect to see the country. If you expect to mount and descend at\\npleasure, you cannot do so, without losing your gas. Up to this time no\\nother means have been devised, and it is this that has always prevented\\nlong journeys in the air.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Dick, I have only one word to answer--I shall not lose one\\nparticle of gas.\"\\n\\n\"And yet you can descend when you please?\"\\n\\n\"I shall descend when I please.\"\\n\\n\"And how will you do that?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, ha! therein lies my secret, friend Dick. Have faith, and let my\\ndevice be yours--\\'Excelsior!\\'\"\\n\\n\"\\'Excelsior\\' be it then,\" said the sportsman, who did not understand a\\nword of Latin.\\n\\nBut he made up his mind to oppose his friend\\'s departure by all means in\\nhis power, and so pretended to give in, at the same time keeping on the\\nwatch. As for the doctor, he went on diligently with his preparations.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTH.\\n\\nAfrican Explorations.--Barth, Richardson, Overweg, Werne, Brun-Rollet,\\nPenney, Andrea, Debono, Miani, Guillaume Lejean, Bruce, Krapf and\\nRebmann, Maizan, Roscher, Burton and Speke.\\n\\nThe aerial line which Dr. Ferguson counted upon following had not been\\nchosen at random; his point of departure had been carefully studied,\\nand it was not without good cause that he had resolved to ascend at\\nthe island of Zanzibar. This island, lying near to the eastern coast of\\nAfrica, is in the sixth degree of south latitude, that is to say, four\\nhundred and thirty geographical miles below the equator.\\n\\nFrom this island the latest expedition, sent by way of the great lakes\\nto explore the sources of the Nile, had just set out.\\n\\nBut it would be well to indicate what explorations Dr. Ferguson hoped to\\nlink together. The two principal ones were those of Dr. Barth in 1849,\\nand of Lieutenants Burton and Speke in 1858.\\n\\nDr. Barth is a Hamburger, who obtained permission for himself and\\nfor his countryman Overweg to join the expedition of the Englishman\\nRichardson. The latter was charged with a mission in the Soudan.\\n\\nThis vast region is situated between the fifteenth and tenth degrees\\nof north latitude; that is to say, that, in order to approach it, the\\nexplorer must penetrate fifteen hundred miles into the interior of\\nAfrica.\\n\\nUntil then, the country in question had been known only through the\\njourneys of Denham, of Clapperton, and of Oudney, made from 1822 to\\n1824. Richardson, Barth, and Overweg, jealously anxious to push their\\ninvestigations farther, arrived at Tunis and Tripoli, like their\\npredecessors, and got as far as Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan.\\n\\nThey then abandoned the perpendicular line, and made a sharp turn\\nwestward toward Ghat, guided, with difficulty, by the Touaregs. After\\na thousand scenes of pillage, of vexation, and attacks by armed forces,\\ntheir caravan arrived, in October, at the vast oasis of Asben. Dr. Barth\\nseparated from his companions, made an excursion to the town of Aghades,\\nand rejoined the expedition, which resumed its march on the 12th of\\nDecember. At length it reached the province of Damerghou; there the\\nthree travellers parted, and Barth took the road to Kano, where he\\narrived by dint of perseverance, and after paying considerable tribute.\\n\\nIn spite of an intense fever, he quitted that place on the 7th of March,\\naccompanied by a single servant. The principal aim of his journey was to\\nreconnoitre Lake Tchad, from which he was still three hundred and fifty\\nmiles distant. He therefore advanced toward the east, and reached the\\ntown of Zouricolo, in the Bornou country, which is the core of the great\\ncentral empire of Africa. There he heard of the death of Richardson, who\\nhad succumbed to fatigue and privation. He next arrived at Kouka, the\\ncapital of Bornou, on the borders of the lake. Finally, at the end of\\nthree weeks, on the 14th of April, twelve months after having quitted\\nTripoli, he reached the town of Ngornou.\\n\\nWe find him again setting forth on the 29th of March, 1851, with\\nOverweg, to visit the kingdom of Adamaoua, to the south of the lake, and\\nfrom there he pushed on as far as the town of Yola, a little below nine\\ndegrees north latitude. This was the extreme southern limit reached by\\nthat daring traveller.\\n\\nHe returned in the month of August to Kouka; from there he successively\\ntraversed the Mandara, Barghimi, and Klanem countries, and reached his\\nextreme limit in the east, the town of Masena, situated at seventeen\\ndegrees twenty minutes west longitude.\\n\\nOn the 25th of November, 1852, after the death of Overweg, his last\\ncompanion, he plunged into the west, visited Sockoto, crossed the Niger,\\nand finally reached Timbuctoo, where he had to languish, during eight\\nlong months, under vexations inflicted upon him by the sheik, and all\\nkinds of ill-treatment and wretchedness. But the presence of a Christian\\nin the city could not long be tolerated, and the Foullans threatened to\\nbesiege it. The doctor, therefore, left it on the 17th of March, 1854,\\nand fled to the frontier, where he remained for thirty-three days in\\nthe most abject destitution. He then managed to get back to Kano in\\nNovember, thence to Kouka, where he resumed Denham\\'s route after four\\nmonths\\' delay. He regained Tripoli toward the close of August, 1855,\\nand arrived in London on the 6th of September, the only survivor of his\\nparty.\\n\\nSuch was the venturesome journey of Dr. Barth.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson carefully noted the fact, that he had stopped at four\\ndegrees north latitude and seventeen degrees west longitude.\\n\\nNow let us see what Lieutenants Burton and Speke accomplished in Eastern\\nAfrica.\\n\\nThe various expeditions that had ascended the Nile could never manage to\\nreach the mysterious source of that river. According to the narrative\\nof the German doctor, Ferdinand Werne, the expedition attempted in 1840,\\nunder the auspices of Mehemet Ali, stopped at Gondokoro, between the\\nfourth and fifth parallels of north latitude.\\n\\nIn 1855, Brun-Rollet, a native of Savoy, appointed consul for Sardinia\\nin Eastern Soudan, to take the place of Vaudey, who had just died, set\\nout from Karthoum, and, under the name of Yacoub the merchant, trading\\nin gums and ivory, got as far as Belenia, beyond the fourth degree, but\\nhad to return in ill-health to Karthoum, where he died in 1857.\\n\\nNeither Dr. Penney--the head of the Egyptian medical service, who, in\\na small steamer, penetrated one degree beyond Gondokoro, and then came\\nback to die of exhaustion at Karthoum--nor Miani, the Venetian, who,\\nturning the cataracts below Gondokoro, reached the second parallel--nor\\nthe Maltese trader, Andrea Debono, who pushed his journey up the Nile\\nstill farther--could work their way beyond the apparently impassable\\nlimit.\\n\\nIn 1859, M. Guillaume Lejean, intrusted with a mission by the French\\nGovernment, reached Karthoum by way of the Red Sea, and embarked upon\\nthe Nile with a retinue of twenty-one hired men and twenty soldiers, but\\nhe could not get past Gondokoro, and ran extreme risk of his life among\\nthe negro tribes, who were in full revolt. The expedition directed by M.\\nd\\'Escayrac de Lauture made an equally unsuccessful attempt to reach the\\nfamous sources of the Nile.\\n\\nThis fatal limit invariably brought every traveller to a halt. In\\nancient times, the ambassadors of Nero reached the ninth degree of\\nlatitude, but in eighteen centuries only from five to six degrees, or\\nfrom three hundred to three hundred and sixty geographical miles, were\\ngained.\\n\\nMany travellers endeavored to reach the sources of the Nile by taking\\ntheir point of departure on the eastern coast of Africa.\\n\\nBetween 1768 and 1772 the Scotch traveller, Bruce, set out from\\nMassowah, a port of Abyssinia, traversed the Tigre, visited the ruins of\\nAxum, saw the sources of the Nile where they did not exist, and obtained\\nno serious result.\\n\\nIn 1844, Dr. Krapf, an Anglican missionary, founded an establishment\\nat Monbaz, on the coast of Zanguebar, and, in company with the Rev. Dr.\\nRebmann, discovered two mountain-ranges three hundred miles from the\\ncoast. These were the mountains of Kilimandjaro and Kenia, which Messrs.\\nde Heuglin and Thornton have partly scaled so recently.\\n\\nIn 1845, Maizan, the French explorer, disembarked, alone, at Bagamayo,\\ndirectly opposite to Zanzibar, and got as far as Deje-la-Mhora, where\\nthe chief caused him to be put to death in the most cruel torment.\\n\\nIn 1859, in the month of August, the young traveller, Roscher, from\\nHamburg, set out with a caravan of Arab merchants, reached Lake Nyassa,\\nand was there assassinated while he slept.\\n\\nFinally, in 1857, Lieutenants Burton and Speke, both officers in the\\nBengal army, were sent by the London Geographical Society to explore the\\ngreat African lakes, and on the 17th of June they quitted Zanzibar, and\\nplunged directly into the west.\\n\\nAfter four months of incredible suffering, their baggage having been\\npillaged, and their attendants beaten and slain, they arrived at Kazeh,\\na sort of central rendezvous for traders and caravans. They were in the\\nmidst of the country of the Moon, and there they collected some precious\\ndocuments concerning the manners, government, religion, fauna, and flora\\nof the region. They next made for the first of the great lakes, the\\none named Tanganayika, situated between the third and eighth degrees\\nof south latitude. They reached it on the 14th of February, 1858, and\\nvisited the various tribes residing on its banks, the most of whom are\\ncannibals.\\n\\nThey departed again on the 26th of May, and reentered Kazeh on the 20th\\nof June. There Burton, who was completely worn out, lay ill for several\\nmonths, during which time Speke made a push to the northward of more\\nthan three hundred miles, going as far as Lake Okeracua, which he came\\nin sight of on the 3d of August; but he could descry only the opening of\\nit at latitude two degrees thirty minutes.\\n\\nHe reached Kazeh, on his return, on the 25th of August, and, in company\\nwith Burton, again took up the route to Zanzibar, where they arrived\\nin the month of March in the following year. These two daring explorers\\nthen reembarked for England; and the Geographical Society of Paris\\ndecreed them its annual prize medal.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson carefully remarked that they had not gone beyond the second\\ndegree of south latitude, nor the twenty-ninth of east longitude.\\n\\nThe problem, therefore, was how to link the explorations of Burton\\nand Speke with those of Dr. Barth, since to do so was to undertake to\\ntraverse an extent of more than twelve degrees of territory.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTH.\\n\\nKennedy\\'s Dreams.--Articles and Pronouns in the Plural.--Dick\\'s\\nInsinuations.--A Promenade over the Map of Africa.--What is contained\\nbetween two Points of the Compass.--Expeditions now on foot.--Speke and\\nGrant.--Krapf, De Decken, and De Heuglin.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson energetically pushed the preparations for his departure,\\nand in person superintended the construction of his balloon, with\\ncertain modifications; in regard to which he observed the most absolute\\nsilence. For a long time past he had been applying himself to the study\\nof the Arab language and the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to\\nhis talents as a polyglot, he had made rapid progress.\\n\\nIn the mean while his friend, the sportsman, never let him out of his\\nsight--afraid, no doubt, that the doctor might take his departure,\\nwithout saying a word to anybody. On this subject, he regaled him with\\nthe most persuasive arguments, which, however, did NOT persuade Samuel\\nFerguson, and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties, by which the\\nlatter seemed to be but slightly moved. In fine, Dick felt that the\\ndoctor was slipping through his fingers.\\n\\nThe poor Scot was really to be pitied. He could not look upon the azure\\nvault without a sombre terror: when asleep, he felt oscillations that\\nmade his head reel; and every night he had visions of being swung aloft\\nat immeasurable heights.\\n\\nWe must add that, during these fearful nightmares, he once or twice fell\\nout of bed. His first care then was to show Ferguson a severe contusion\\nthat he had received on the cranium. \"And yet,\" he would add, with\\nwarmth, \"that was at the height of only three feet--not an inch\\nmore--and such a bump as this! Only think, then!\"\\n\\nThis insinuation, full of sad meaning as it was, did not seem to touch\\nthe doctor\\'s heart.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll not fall,\" was his invariable reply.\\n\\n\"But, still, suppose that we WERE to fall!\"\\n\\n\"We will NOT fall!\"\\n\\nThis was decisive, and Kennedy had nothing more to say.\\n\\nWhat particularly exasperated Dick was, that the doctor seemed\\ncompletely to lose sight of his personality--of his--Kennedy\\'s--and to\\nlook upon him as irrevocably destined to become his aerial companion.\\nNot even the shadow of a doubt was ever suggested; and Samuel made an\\nintolerable misuse of the first person plural:\\n\\n\"\\'We\\' are getting along; \\'we\\' shall be ready on the----; \\'we\\' shall\\nstart on the----,\" etc., etc.\\n\\nAnd then there was the singular possessive adjective:\\n\\n\"\\'Our\\' balloon; \\'our\\' car; \\'our\\' expedition.\"\\n\\nAnd the same in the plural, too:\\n\\n\"\\'Our\\' preparations; \\'our\\' discoveries; \\'our\\' ascensions.\"\\n\\nDick shuddered at them, although he was determined not to go; but he\\ndid not want to annoy his friend. Let us also disclose the fact that,\\nwithout knowing exactly why himself, he had sent to Edinburgh for a\\ncertain selection of heavy clothing, and his best hunting-gear and\\nfire-arms.\\n\\nOne day, after having admitted that, with an overwhelming run of\\ngood-luck, there MIGHT be one chance of success in a thousand, he\\npretended to yield entirely to the doctor\\'s wishes; but, in order\\nto still put off the journey, he opened the most varied series of\\nsubterfuges. He threw himself back upon questioning the utility of the\\nexpedition--its opportuneness, etc. This discovery of the sources of the\\nNile, was it likely to be of any use?--Would one have really labored\\nfor the welfare of humanity?--When, after all, the African tribes should\\nhave been civilized, would they be any happier?--Were folks certain\\nthat civilization had not its chosen abode there rather than in\\nEurope?--Perhaps!--And then, couldn\\'t one wait a little longer?--The\\ntrip across Africa would certainly be accomplished some day, and in a\\nless hazardous manner.--In another month, or in six months before the\\nyear was over, some explorer would undoubtedly come in--etc., etc.\\n\\nThese hints produced an effect exactly opposite to what was desired or\\nintended, and the doctor trembled with impatience.\\n\\n\"Are you willing, then, wretched Dick--are you willing, false\\nfriend--that this glory should belong to another? Must I then be untrue\\nto my past history; recoil before obstacles that are not serious;\\nrequite with cowardly hesitation what both the English Government and\\nthe Royal Society of London have done for me?\"\\n\\n\"But,\" resumed Kennedy, who made great use of that conjunction.\\n\\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"are you not aware that my journey is to compete\\nwith the success of the expeditions now on foot? Don\\'t you know that\\nfresh explorers are advancing toward the centre of Africa?\"\\n\\n\"Still--\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Dick, and cast your eyes over that map.\"\\n\\nDick glanced over it, with resignation.\\n\\n\"Now, ascend the course of the Nile.\"\\n\\n\"I have ascended it,\" replied the Scotchman, with docility.\\n\\n\"Stop at Gondokoro.\"\\n\\n\"I am there.\"\\n\\nAnd Kennedy thought to himself how easy such a trip was--on the map!\\n\\n\"Now, take one of the points of these dividers and let it rest upon that\\nplace beyond which the most daring explorers have scarcely gone.\"\\n\\n\"I have done so.\"\\n\\n\"And now look along the coast for the island of Zanzibar, in latitude\\nsix degrees south.\"\\n\\n\"I have it.\"\\n\\n\"Now, follow the same parallel and arrive at Kazeh.\"\\n\\n\"I have done so.\"\\n\\n\"Run up again along the thirty-third degree of longitude to the opening\\nof Lake Oukereoue, at the point where Lieutenant Speke had to halt.\"\\n\\n\"I am there; a little more, and I should have tumbled into the lake.\"\\n\\n\"Very good! Now, do you know what we have the right to suppose,\\naccording to the information given by the tribes that live along its\\nshores?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea.\"\\n\\n\"Why, that this lake, the lower extremity of which is in two degrees\\nand thirty minutes, must extend also two degrees and a half above the\\nequator.\"\\n\\n\"Really!\"\\n\\n\"Well from this northern extremity there flows a stream which must\\nnecessarily join the Nile, if it be not the Nile itself.\"\\n\\n\"That is, indeed, curious.\"\\n\\n\"Then, let the other point of your dividers rest upon that extremity of\\nLake Oukereoue.\"\\n\\n\"It is done, friend Ferguson.\"\\n\\n\"Now, how many degrees can you count between the two points?\"\\n\\n\"Scarcely two.\"\\n\\n\"And do you know what that means, Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Why, that makes scarcely one hundred and twenty miles--in other words,\\na nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Almost nothing, Samuel.\"\\n\\n\"Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?\"\\n\\n\"No, upon my honor, I do not.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, then, I\\'ll tell you. The Geographical Society regard as very\\nimportant the exploration of this lake of which Speke caught a glimpse.\\nUnder their auspices, Lieutenant (now Captain) Speke has associated with\\nhim Captain Grant, of the army in India; they have put themselves at\\nthe head of a numerous and well-equipped expedition; their mission is to\\nascend the lake and return to Gondokoro; they have received a subsidy\\nof more than five thousand pounds, and the Governor of the Cape of Good\\nHope has placed Hottentot soldiers at their disposal; they set out\\nfrom Zanzibar at the close of October, 1860. In the mean while John\\nPetherick, the English consul at the city of Karthoum, has received\\nabout seven hundred pounds from the foreign office; he is to equip a\\nsteamer at Karthoum, stock it with sufficient provisions, and make his\\nway to Gondokoro; there, he will await Captain Speke\\'s caravan, and be\\nable to replenish its supplies to some extent.\"\\n\\n\"Well planned,\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"You can easily see, then, that time presses if we are to take part in\\nthese exploring labors. And that is not all, since, while some are thus\\nadvancing with sure steps to the discovery of the sources of the Nile,\\nothers are penetrating to the very heart of Africa.\"\\n\\n\"On foot?\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Yes, on foot,\" rejoined the doctor, without noticing the insinuation.\\n\"Doctor Krapf proposes to push forward, in the west, by way of the Djob,\\na river lying under the equator. Baron de Decken has already set out\\nfrom Monbaz, has reconnoitred the mountains of Kenaia and Kilimandjaro,\\nand is now plunging in toward the centre.\"\\n\\n\"But all this time on foot?\"\\n\\n\"On foot or on mules.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly the same, so far as I am concerned,\" ejaculated Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Lastly,\" resumed the doctor, \"M. de Heuglin, the Austrian vice-consul\\nat Karthoum, has just organized a very important expedition, the first\\naim of which is to search for the traveller Vogel, who, in 1853, was\\nsent into the Soudan to associate himself with the labors of Dr. Barth.\\nIn 1856, he quitted Bornou, and determined to explore the unknown\\ncountry that lies between Lake Tchad and Darfur. Nothing has been seen\\nof him since that time. Letters that were received in Alexandria, in\\n1860, said that he was killed at the order of the King of Wadai; but\\nother letters, addressed by Dr. Hartmann to the traveller\\'s father,\\nrelate that, according to the recital of a felatah of Bornou, Vogel was\\nmerely held as a prisoner at Wara. All hope is not then lost. Hence,\\na committee has been organized under the presidency of the Regent of\\nSaxe-Cogurg-Gotha; my friend Petermann is its secretary; a national\\nsubscription has provided for the expense of the expedition, whose\\nstrength has been increased by the voluntary accession of several\\nlearned men, and M. de Heuglin set out from Massowah, in the month of\\nJune. While engaged in looking for Vogel, he is also to explore all\\nthe country between the Nile and Lake Tchad, that is to say, to knit\\ntogether the operations of Captain Speke and those of Dr. Barth, and\\nthen Africa will have been traversed from east to west.\"*\\n\\n     * After the departure of Dr. Ferguson, it was ascertained\\n     that M. de Heuglin, owing to some disagreement, took a route\\n     different from the one assigned to his expedition, the\\n     command of the latter having been transferred to Mr.\\n     Muntzinger.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the canny Scot, \"since every thing is getting on so well,\\nwhat\\'s the use of our going down there?\"\\n\\nDr. Ferguson made no reply, but contented himself with a significant\\nshrug of the shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTH.\\n\\nA Servant--match him!--He can see the Satellites of Jupiter.--Dick\\nand Joe hard at it.--Doubt and Faith.--The Weighing Ceremony.--Joe and\\nWellington.--He gets a Half-crown.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson had a servant who answered with alacrity to the name\\nof Joe. He was an excellent fellow, who testified the most absolute\\nconfidence in his master, and the most unlimited devotion to his\\ninterests, even anticipating his wishes and orders, which were always\\nintelligently executed. In fine, he was a Caleb without the growling,\\nand a perfect pattern of constant good-humor. Had he been made on\\npurpose for the place, it could not have been better done. Ferguson\\nput himself entirely in his hands, so far as the ordinary details of\\nexistence were concerned, and he did well. Incomparable, whole-souled\\nJoe! a servant who orders your dinner; who likes what you like; who\\npacks your trunk, without forgetting your socks or your linen; who has\\ncharge of your keys and your secrets, and takes no advantage of all\\nthis!\\n\\nBut then, what a man the doctor was in the eyes of this worthy Joe! With\\nwhat respect and what confidence the latter received all his decisions!\\nWhen Ferguson had spoken, he would be a fool who should attempt to\\nquestion the matter. Every thing he thought was exactly right; every\\nthing he said, the perfection of wisdom; every thing he ordered to be\\ndone, quite feasible; all that he undertook, practicable; all that\\nhe accomplished, admirable. You might have cut Joe to pieces--not an\\nagreeable operation, to be sure--and yet he would not have altered his\\nopinion of his master.\\n\\nSo, when the doctor conceived the project of crossing Africa through the\\nair, for Joe the thing was already done; obstacles no longer existed;\\nfrom the moment when the doctor had made up his mind to start, he had\\narrived--along with his faithful attendant, too, for the noble fellow\\nknew, without a word uttered about it, that he would be one of the\\nparty.\\n\\nMoreover, he was just the man to render the greatest service by his\\nintelligence and his wonderful agility. Had the occasion arisen to name\\na professor of gymnastics for the monkeys in the Zoological Garden (who\\nare smart enough, by-the-way!), Joe would certainly have received the\\nappointment. Leaping, climbing, almost flying--these were all sport to\\nhim.\\n\\nIf Ferguson was the head and Kennedy the arm, Joe was to be the right\\nhand of the expedition. He had, already, accompanied his master on\\nseveral journeys, and had a smattering of science appropriate to his\\ncondition and style of mind, but he was especially remarkable for a\\nsort of mild philosophy, a charming turn of optimism. In his sight every\\nthing was easy, logical, natural, and, consequently, he could see no use\\nin complaining or grumbling.\\n\\nAmong other gifts, he possessed a strength and range of vision that\\nwere perfectly surprising. He enjoyed, in common with Moestlin, Kepler\\'s\\nprofessor, the rare faculty of distinguishing the satellites of Jupiter\\nwith the naked eye, and of counting fourteen of the stars in the group\\nof Pleiades, the remotest of them being only of the ninth magnitude.\\nHe presumed none the more for that; on the contrary, he made his bow to\\nyou, at a distance, and when occasion arose he bravely knew how to use\\nhis eyes.\\n\\nWith such profound faith as Joe felt in the doctor, it is not to\\nbe wondered at that incessant discussions sprang up between him and\\nKennedy, without any lack of respect to the latter, however.\\n\\nOne doubted, the other believed; one had a prudent foresight, the\\nother blind confidence. The doctor, however, vibrated between doubt and\\nconfidence; that is to say, he troubled his head with neither one nor\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Kennedy,\" Joe would say.\\n\\n\"Well, my boy?\"\\n\\n\"The moment\\'s at hand. It seems that we are to sail for the moon.\"\\n\\n\"You mean the Mountains of the Moon, which are not quite so far off.\\nBut, never mind, one trip is just as dangerous as the other!\"\\n\\n\"Dangerous! What! with a man like Dr. Ferguson?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to spoil your illusions, my good Joe; but this undertaking\\nof his is nothing more nor less than the act of a madman. He won\\'t go,\\nthough!\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t go, eh? Then you haven\\'t seen his balloon at Mitchell\\'s\\nfactory in the Borough?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take precious good care to keep away from it!\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ll lose a fine sight, sir. What a splendid thing it is! What\\na pretty shape! What a nice car! How snug we\\'ll feel in it!\"\\n\\n\"Then you really think of going with your master?\"\\n\\n\"I?\" answered Joe, with an accent of profound conviction. \"Why, I\\'d go\\nwith him wherever he pleases! Who ever heard of such a thing? Leave him\\nto go off alone, after we\\'ve been all over the world together! Who would\\nhelp him, when he was tired? Who would give him a hand in climbing over\\nthe rocks? Who would attend him when he was sick? No, Mr. Kennedy, Joe\\nwill always stick to the doctor!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re a fine fellow, Joe!\"\\n\\n\"But, then, you\\'re coming with us!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Kennedy; \"that is to say, I will go with you up to\\nthe last moment, to prevent Samuel even then from being guilty of such\\nan act of folly! I will follow him as far as Zanzibar, so as to stop him\\nthere, if possible.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll stop nothing at all, Mr. Kennedy, with all respect to you, sir.\\nMy master is no hare-brained person; he takes a long time to think over\\nwhat he means to do, and then, when he once gets started, the Evil One\\nhimself couldn\\'t make him give it up.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see about that.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t flatter yourself, sir--but then, the main thing is, to have\\nyou with us. For a hunter like you, sir, Africa\\'s a great country. So,\\neither way, you won\\'t be sorry for the trip.\"\\n\\n\"No, that\\'s a fact, I shan\\'t be sorry for it, if I can get this crazy\\nman to give up his scheme.\"\\n\\n\"By-the-way,\" said Joe, \"you know that the weighing comes off to-day.\"\\n\\n\"The weighing--what weighing?\"\\n\\n\"Why, my master, and you, and I, are all to be weighed to-day!\"\\n\\n\"What! like horse-jockeys?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, like jockeys. Only, never fear, you won\\'t be expected to make\\nyourself lean, if you\\'re found to be heavy. You\\'ll go as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can tell you, I am not going to let myself be weighed,\" said\\nKennedy, firmly.\\n\\n\"But, sir, it seems that the doctor\\'s machine requires it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, his machine will have to do without it.\"\\n\\n\"Humph! and suppose that it couldn\\'t go up, then?\"\\n\\n\"Egad! that\\'s all I want!\"\\n\\n\"Come! come, Mr. Kennedy! My master will be sending for us directly.\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t go.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! now, you won\\'t vex the doctor in that way!\"\\n\\n\"Aye! that I will.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Joe with a laugh, \"you say that because he\\'s not here;\\nbut when he says to your face, \\'Dick!\\' (with all respect to you, sir,)\\n\\'Dick, I want to know exactly how much you weigh,\\' you\\'ll go, I warrant\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"No, I will NOT go!\"\\n\\nAt this moment the doctor entered his study, where this discussion had\\nbeen taking place; and, as he came in, cast a glance at Kennedy, who did\\nnot feel altogether at his ease.\\n\\n\"Dick,\" said the doctor, \"come with Joe; I want to know how much you\\nboth weigh.\"\\n\\n\"But--\"\\n\\n\"You may keep your hat on. Come!\" And Kennedy went.\\n\\nThey repaired in company to the workshop of the Messrs. Mitchell,\\nwhere one of those so-called \"Roman\" scales was in readiness. It\\nwas necessary, by the way, for the doctor to know the weight of his\\ncompanions, so as to fix the equilibrium of his balloon; so he made Dick\\nget up on the platform of the scales. The latter, without making any\\nresistance, said, in an undertone:\\n\\n\"Oh! well, that doesn\\'t bind me to any thing.\"\\n\\n\"One hundred and fifty-three pounds,\" said the doctor, noting it down on\\nhis tablets.\\n\\n\"Am I too heavy?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no, Mr. Kennedy!\" said Joe; \"and then, you know, I am light to\\nmake up for it.\"\\n\\nSo saying, Joe, with enthusiasm, took his place on the scales, and\\nvery nearly upset them in his ready haste. He struck the attitude of\\nWellington where he is made to ape Achilles, at Hyde-Park entrance, and\\nwas superb in it, without the shield.\\n\\n\"One hundred and twenty pounds,\" wrote the doctor.\\n\\n\"Ah! ha!\" said Joe, with a smile of satisfaction And why did he smile?\\nHe never could tell himself.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my turn now,\" said Ferguson--and he put down one hundred and\\nthirty-five pounds to his own account.\\n\\n\"All three of us,\" said he, \"do not weigh much more than four hundred\\npounds.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir,\" said Joe, \"if it was necessary for your expedition, I could\\nmake myself thinner by twenty pounds, by not eating so much.\"\\n\\n\"Useless, my boy!\" replied the doctor. \"You may eat as much as you like,\\nand here\\'s half-a-crown to buy you the ballast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTH.\\n\\nGeometrical Details.--Calculation of the Capacity of the Balloon.--The\\nDouble Receptacle.--The Covering.--The Car.--The Mysterious\\nApparatus.--The Provisions and Stores.--The Final Summing up.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson had long been engaged upon the details of his expedition.\\nIt is easy to comprehend that the balloon--that marvellous vehicle\\nwhich was to convey him through the air--was the constant object of his\\nsolicitude.\\n\\nAt the outset, in order not to give the balloon too ponderous\\ndimensions, he had decided to fill it with hydrogen gas, which is\\nfourteen and a half times lighter than common air. The production of\\nthis gas is easy, and it has given the greatest satisfaction hitherto in\\naerostatic experiments.\\n\\nThe doctor, according to very accurate calculations, found that,\\nincluding the articles indispensable to his journey and his apparatus,\\nhe should have to carry a weight of 4,000 pounds; therefore he had to\\nfind out what would be the ascensional force of a balloon capable of\\nraising such a weight, and, consequently, what would be its capacity.\\n\\nA weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the\\nair amounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven\\ncubic feet; or, in other words, forty-four thousand eight hundred and\\nforty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds.\\n\\nBy giving the balloon these cubic dimensions, and filling it with\\nhydrogen gas, instead of common air--the former being fourteen and\\na half times lighter and weighing therefore only two hundred and\\nseventy-six pounds--a difference of three thousand seven hundred and\\ntwenty-four pounds in equilibrium is produced; and it is this difference\\nbetween the weight of the gas contained in the balloon and the weight of\\nthe surrounding atmosphere that constitutes the ascensional force of the\\nformer.\\n\\nHowever, were the forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven\\ncubic feet of gas of which we speak, all introduced into the balloon, it\\nwould be entirely filled; but that would not do, because, as the balloon\\ncontinued to mount into the more rarefied layers of the atmosphere,\\nthe gas within would dilate, and soon burst the cover containing it.\\nBalloons, then, are usually only two-thirds filled.\\n\\nBut the doctor, in carrying out a project known only to himself,\\nresolved to fill his balloon only one-half; and, since he had to carry\\nforty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of gas,\\nto give his balloon nearly double capacity he arranged it in that\\nelongated, oval shape which has come to be preferred. The horizontal\\ndiameter was fifty feet, and the vertical diameter seventy-five feet.\\nHe thus obtained a spheroid, the capacity of which amounted, in round\\nnumbers, to ninety thousand cubic feet.\\n\\nCould Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons, his chances of success would\\nhave been increased; for, should one burst in the air, he could, by\\nthrowing out ballast, keep himself up with the other. But the management\\nof two balloons would, necessarily, be very difficult, in view of the\\nproblem how to keep them both at an equal ascensional force.\\n\\nAfter having pondered the matter carefully, Dr. Ferguson, by an\\ningenious arrangement, combined the advantages of two balloons, without\\nincurring their inconveniences. He constructed two of different sizes,\\nand inclosed the smaller in the larger one. His external balloon, which\\nhad the dimensions given above, contained a less one of the same shape,\\nwhich was only forty-five feet in horizontal, and sixty-eight feet\\nin vertical diameter. The capacity of this interior balloon was\\nonly sixty-seven thousand cubic feet: it was to float in the fluid\\nsurrounding it. A valve opened from one balloon into the other, and thus\\nenabled the aeronaut to communicate with both.\\n\\nThis arrangement offered the advantage, that if gas had to be let off,\\nso as to descend, that which was in the outer balloon would go first;\\nand, were it completely emptied, the smaller one would still remain\\nintact. The outer envelope might then be cast off as a useless\\nencumbrance; and the second balloon, left free to itself, would not\\noffer the same hold to the currents of air as a half-inflated one must\\nneeds present.\\n\\nMoreover, in case of an accident happening to the outside balloon, such\\nas getting torn, for instance, the other would remain intact.\\n\\nThe balloons were made of a strong but light Lyons silk, coated with\\ngutta percha. This gummy, resinous substance is absolutely water-proof,\\nand also resists acids and gas perfectly. The silk was doubled, at the\\nupper extremity of the oval, where most of the strain would come.\\n\\nSuch an envelope as this could retain the inflating fluid for any length\\nof time. It weighed half a pound per nine square feet. Hence the surface\\nof the outside balloon being about eleven thousand six hundred square\\nfeet, its envelope weighed six hundred and fifty pounds. The envelope\\nof the second or inner balloon, having nine thousand two hundred square\\nfeet of surface, weighed only about five hundred and ten pounds, or say\\neleven hundred and sixty pounds for both.\\n\\nThe network that supported the car was made of very strong hempen\\ncord, and the two valves were the object of the most minute and careful\\nattention, as the rudder of a ship would be.\\n\\nThe car, which was of a circular form and fifteen feet in diameter, was\\nmade of wicker-work, strengthened with a slight covering of iron, and\\nprotected below by a system of elastic springs, to deaden the shock of\\ncollision. Its weight, along with that of the network, did not exceed\\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds.\\n\\nIn addition to the above, the doctor caused to be constructed two\\nsheet-iron chests two lines in thickness. These were connected by means\\nof pipes furnished with stopcocks. He joined to these a spiral, two\\ninches in diameter, which terminated in two branch pieces of unequal\\nlength, the longer of which, however, was twenty-five feet in height and\\nthe shorter only fifteen feet.\\n\\nThese sheet-iron chests were embedded in the car in such a way as to\\ntake up the least possible amount of space. The spiral, which was not to\\nbe adjusted until some future moment, was packed up, separately, along\\nwith a very strong Buntzen electric battery. This apparatus had been\\nso ingeniously combined that it did not weigh more than seven hundred\\npounds, even including twenty-five gallons of water in another\\nreceptacle.\\n\\nThe instruments provided for the journey consisted of two barometers,\\ntwo thermometers, two compasses, a sextant, two chronometers, an\\nartificial horizon, and an altazimuth, to throw out the height of\\ndistant and inaccessible objects.\\n\\nThe Greenwich Observatory had placed itself at the doctor\\'s disposal.\\nThe latter, however, did not intend to make experiments in physics; he\\nmerely wanted to be able to know in what direction he was passing, and\\nto determine the position of the principal rivers, mountains, and towns.\\n\\nHe also provided himself with three thoroughly tested iron anchors, and\\na light but strong silk ladder fifty feet in length.\\n\\nHe at the same time carefully weighed his stores of provision, which\\nconsisted of tea, coffee, biscuit, salted meat, and pemmican, a\\npreparation which comprises many nutritive elements in a small space.\\nBesides a sufficient stock of pure brandy, he arranged two water-tanks,\\neach of which contained twenty-two gallons.\\n\\nThe consumption of these articles would necessarily, little by little,\\ndiminish the weight to be sustained, for it must be remembered that\\nthe equilibrium of a balloon floating in the atmosphere is extremely\\nsensitive. The loss of an almost insignificant weight suffices to\\nproduce a very noticeable displacement.\\n\\nNor did the doctor forget an awning to shelter the car, nor the\\ncoverings and blankets that were to be the bedding of the journey, nor\\nsome fowling pieces and rifles, with their requisite supply of powder\\nand ball.\\n\\nHere is the summing up of his various items, and their weight, as he\\ncomputed it:\\n\\n       Ferguson...........................  135 pounds.\\n       Kennedy............................  153   \"\\n       Joe................................  120   \"\\n       Weight of the outside balloon......  650   \"\\n       Weight of the second balloon.......  510   \"\\n       Car and network....................  280   \"\\n       Anchors, instruments, awnings,\\n         and sundry utensils, guns,\\n         coverings, etc...................  190   \"\\n       Meat, pemmican, biscuits, tea,\\n         coffee, brandy...................  386   \"\\n       Water..............................  400   \"\\n       Apparatus..........................  700   \"\\n       Weight of the hydrogen.............  276   \"\\n       Ballast............................  200   \"\\n                                         -----\\n                                          4,000 pounds.\\n\\nSuch were the items of the four thousand pounds that Dr. Ferguson\\nproposed to carry up with him. He took only two hundred pounds of\\nballast for \"unforeseen emergencies,\" as he remarked, since otherwise he\\ndid not expect to use any, thanks to the peculiarity of his apparatus.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTH.\\n\\nJoe\\'s Importance.--The Commander of the Resolute.--Kennedy\\'s\\nArsenal.--Mutual Amenities.--The Farewell Dinner.--Departure on the\\n21st of February.--The Doctor\\'s Scientific\\nSessions.--Duveyrier.--Livingstone.--Details of the Aerial\\nVoyage.--Kennedy silenced.\\n\\nAbout the 10th of February, the preparations were pretty well completed;\\nand the balloons, firmly secured, one within the other, were altogether\\nfinished. They had been subjected to a powerful pneumatic pressure in\\nall parts, and the test gave excellent evidence of their solidity and of\\nthe care applied in their construction.\\n\\nJoe hardly knew what he was about, with delight. He trotted incessantly\\nto and fro between his home in Greek Street, and the Mitchell\\nestablishment, always full of business, but always in the highest\\nspirits, giving details of the affair to people who did not even ask\\nhim, so proud was he, above all things, of being permitted to accompany\\nhis master. I have even a shrewd suspicion that what with showing the\\nballoon, explaining the plans and views of the doctor, giving folks a\\nglimpse of the latter, through a half-opened window, or pointing him\\nout as he passed along the streets, the clever scamp earned a few\\nhalf-crowns, but we must not find fault with him for that. He had\\nas much right as anybody else to speculate upon the admiration and\\ncuriosity of his contemporaries.\\n\\nOn the 16th of February, the Resolute cast anchor near Greenwich. She\\nwas a screw propeller of eight hundred tons, a fast sailer, and the very\\nvessel that had been sent out to the polar regions, to revictual the\\nlast expedition of Sir James Ross. Her commander, Captain Bennet,\\nhad the name of being a very amiable person, and he took a particular\\ninterest in the doctor\\'s expedition, having been one of that gentleman\\'s\\nadmirers for a long time. Bennet was rather a man of science than a man\\nof war, which did not, however, prevent his vessel from carrying four\\ncarronades, that had never hurt any body, to be sure, but had performed\\nthe most pacific duty in the world.\\n\\nThe hold of the Resolute was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for\\nthe balloon. The latter was shipped with the greatest precaution on the\\n18th of February, and was then carefully deposited at the bottom of\\nthe vessel in such a way as to prevent accident. The car and its\\naccessories, the anchors, the cords, the supplies, the water-tanks,\\nwhich were to be filled on arriving, all were embarked and put away\\nunder Ferguson\\'s own eyes.\\n\\nTen tons of sulphuric acid and ten tons of iron filings, were put on\\nboard for the future production of the hydrogen gas. The quantity was\\nmore than enough, but it was well to be provided against accident. The\\napparatus to be employed in manufacturing the gas, including some thirty\\nempty casks, was also stowed away in the hold.\\n\\nThese various preparations were terminated on the 18th of February, in\\nthe evening. Two state-rooms, comfortably fitted up, were ready for the\\nreception of Dr. Ferguson and his friend Kennedy. The latter, all\\nthe while swearing that he would not go, went on board with a regular\\narsenal of hunting weapons, among which were two double-barrelled\\nbreech-loading fowling-pieces, and a rifle that had withstood every\\ntest, of the make of Purdey, Moore & Dickson, at Edinburgh. With such\\na weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a bullet in the\\neye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces. Along with\\nthese implements, he had two of Colt\\'s six-shooters, for unforeseen\\nemergencies. His powder-case, his cartridge-pouch, his lead, and his\\nbullets, did not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor.\\n\\nThe three travellers got themselves to rights on board during the\\nworking-hours of February 19th. They were received with much distinction\\nby the captain and his officers, the doctor continuing as reserved as\\never, and thinking of nothing but his expedition. Dick seemed a good\\ndeal moved, but was unwilling to betray it; while Joe was fairly dancing\\nand breaking out in laughable remarks. The worthy fellow soon became the\\njester and merry-andrew of the boatswain\\'s mess, where a berth had been\\nkept for him.\\n\\nOn the 20th, a grand farewell dinner was given to Dr. Ferguson and\\nKennedy by the Royal Geographical Society. Commander Bennet and his\\nofficers were present at the entertainment, which was signalized by\\ncopious libations and numerous toasts. Healths were drunk, in sufficient\\nabundance to guarantee all the guests a lifetime of centuries. Sir\\nFrancis M----presided, with restrained but dignified feeling.\\n\\nTo his own supreme confusion, Dick Kennedy came in for a large share\\nin the jovial felicitations of the night. After having drunk to the\\n\"intrepid Ferguson, the glory of England,\" they had to drink to \"the no\\nless courageous Kennedy, his daring companion.\"\\n\\nDick blushed a good deal, and that passed for modesty; whereupon the\\napplause redoubled, and Dick blushed again.\\n\\nA message from the Queen arrived while they were at dessert. Her Majesty\\noffered her compliments to the two travellers, and expressed her\\nwishes for their safe and successful journey. This, of course, rendered\\nimperative fresh toasts to \"Her most gracious Majesty.\"\\n\\nAt midnight, after touching farewells and warm shaking of hands, the\\nguests separated.\\n\\nThe boats of the Resolute were in waiting at the stairs of Westminster\\nBridge. The captain leaped in, accompanied by his officers and\\npassengers, and the rapid current of the Thames, aiding the strong arms\\nof the rowers, bore them swiftly to Greenwich. In an hour\\'s time all\\nwere asleep on board.\\n\\nThe next morning, February 21st, at three o\\'clock, the furnaces began\\nto roar; at five, the anchors were weighed, and the Resolute, powerfully\\ndriven by her screw, began to plough the water toward the mouth of the\\nThames.\\n\\nIt is needless to say that the topic of conversation with every one on\\nboard was Dr. Ferguson\\'s enterprise. Seeing and hearing the doctor soon\\ninspired everybody with such confidence that, in a very short time,\\nthere was no one, excepting the incredulous Scotchman, on the steamer\\nwho had the least doubt of the perfect feasibility and success of the\\nexpedition.\\n\\nDuring the long, unoccupied hours of the voyage, the doctor held regular\\nsittings, with lectures on geographical science, in the officers\\'\\nmess-room. These young men felt an intense interest in the discoveries\\nmade during the last forty years in Africa; and the doctor related to\\nthem the explorations of Barth, Burton, Speke, and Grant, and depicted\\nthe wonders of this vast, mysterious country, now thrown open on\\nall sides to the investigations of science. On the north, the young\\nDuveyrier was exploring Sahara, and bringing the chiefs of the\\nTouaregs to Paris. Under the inspiration of the French Government, two\\nexpeditions were preparing, which, descending from the north, and coming\\nfrom the west, would cross each other at Timbuctoo. In the south, the\\nindefatigable Livingstone was still advancing toward the equator; and,\\nsince March, 1862, he had, in company with Mackenzie, ascended the river\\nRovoonia. The nineteenth century would, assuredly, not pass, contended\\nthe doctor, without Africa having been compelled to surrender the\\nsecrets she has kept locked up in her bosom for six thousand years.\\n\\nBut the interest of Dr. Ferguson\\'s hearers was excited to the highest\\npitch when he made known to them, in detail, the preparations for his\\nown journey. They took pleasure in verifying his calculations; they\\ndiscussed them; and the doctor frankly took part in the discussion.\\n\\nAs a general thing, they were surprised at the limited quantity of\\nprovision that he took with him; and one day one of the officers\\nquestioned him on that subject.\\n\\n\"That peculiar point astonishes you, does it?\" said Ferguson.\\n\\n\"It does, indeed.\"\\n\\n\"But how long do you think my trip is going to last? Whole months? If\\nso, you are greatly mistaken. Were it to be a long one, we should be\\nlost; we should never get back. But you must know that the distance from\\nZanzibar to the coast of Senegal is only thirty-five hundred--say four\\nthousand miles. Well, at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every\\ntwelve hours, which does not come near the rapidity of our railroad\\ntrains, by travelling day and night, it would take only seven days to\\ncross Africa!\"\\n\\n\"But then you could see nothing, make no geographical observations, or\\nreconnoitre the face of the country.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" replied the doctor, \"if I am master of my balloon--if I can ascend\\nand descend at will, I shall stop when I please, especially when too\\nviolent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way with them.\"\\n\\n\"And you will encounter such,\" said Captain Bennet. \"There are tornadoes\\nthat sweep at the rate of more than two hundred and forty miles per\\nhour.\"\\n\\n\"You see, then, that with such speed as that, we could cross Africa in\\ntwelve hours. One would rise at Zanzibar, and go to bed at St. Louis!\"\\n\\n\"But,\" rejoined the officer, \"could any balloon withstand the wear and\\ntear of such velocity?\"\\n\\n\"It has happened before,\" replied Ferguson.\\n\\n\"And the balloon withstood it?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly well. It was at the time of the coronation of Napoleon, in\\n1804. The aeronaut, Gernerin, sent up a balloon at Paris, about eleven\\no\\'clock in the evening. It bore the following inscription, in letters of\\ngold: \\'Paris, 25 Frimaire; year XIII; Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon\\nby his Holiness, Pius VII.\\' On the next morning, the inhabitants of Rome\\nsaw the same balloon soaring above the Vatican, whence it crossed the\\nCampagna, and finally fluttered down into the lake of Bracciano. So you\\nsee, gentlemen, that a balloon can resist such velocities.\"\\n\\n\"A balloon--that might be; but a man?\" insinuated Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Yes, a man, too!--for the balloon is always motionless with reference\\nto the air that surrounds it. What moves is the mass of the atmosphere\\nitself: for instance, one may light a taper in the car, and the flame\\nwill not even waver. An aeronaut in Garnerin\\'s balloon would not have\\nsuffered in the least from the speed. But then I have no occasion\\nto attempt such velocity; and if I can anchor to some tree, or some\\nfavorable inequality of the ground, at night, I shall not fail to do so.\\nBesides, we take provision for two months with us, after all; and there\\nis nothing to prevent our skilful huntsman here from furnishing game in\\nabundance when we come to alight.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Kennedy,\" said a young midshipman, with envious eyes, \"what\\nsplendid shots you\\'ll have!\"\\n\\n\"Without counting,\" said another, \"that you\\'ll have the glory as well as\\nthe sport!\"\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied the hunter, stammering with confusion, \"I\\ngreatly--appreciate--your compliments--but they--don\\'t--belong to me.\"\\n\\n\"You!\" exclaimed every body, \"don\\'t you intend to go?\"\\n\\n\"I am not going!\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t accompany Dr. Ferguson?\"\\n\\n\"Not only shall I not accompany him, but I am here so as to be present\\nat the last moment to prevent his going.\"\\n\\nEvery eye was now turned to the doctor.\\n\\n\"Never mind him!\" said the latter, calmly. \"This is a matter that\\nwe can\\'t argue with him. At heart he knows perfectly well that he IS\\ngoing.\"\\n\\n\"By Saint Andrew!\" said Kennedy, \"I swear--\"\\n\\n\"Swear to nothing, friend Dick; you have been ganged and weighed--you\\nand your powder, your guns, and your bullets; so don\\'t let us say\\nanything more about it.\"\\n\\nAnd, in fact, from that day until the arrival at Zanzibar, Dick never\\nopened his mouth. He talked neither about that nor about anything else.\\nHe kept absolutely silent.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINTH.\\n\\nThey double the Cape.--The Forecastle.--A Course of Cosmography by\\nProfessor Joe.--Concerning the Method of guiding Balloons.--How to seek\\nout Atmospheric Currents.--Eureka.\\n\\nThe Resolute plunged along rapidly toward the Cape of Good Hope, the\\nweather continuing fine, although the sea ran heavier.\\n\\nOn the 30th of March, twenty-seven days after the departure from London,\\nthe Table Mountain loomed up on the horizon. Cape City lying at the foot\\nof an amphitheatre of hills, could be distinguished through the ship\\'s\\nglasses, and soon the Resolute cast anchor in the port. But the captain\\ntouched there only to replenish his coal bunkers, and that was but a\\nday\\'s job. On the morrow, he steered away to the south\\'ard, so as\\nto double the southernmost point of Africa, and enter the Mozambique\\nChannel.\\n\\nThis was not Joe\\'s first sea-voyage, and so, for his part, he soon found\\nhimself at home on board; every body liked him for his frankness and\\ngood-humor. A considerable share of his master\\'s renown was reflected\\nupon him. He was listened to as an oracle, and he made no more mistakes\\nthan the next one.\\n\\nSo, while the doctor was pursuing his descriptive course of lecturing in\\nthe officers\\' mess, Joe reigned supreme on the forecastle, holding forth\\nin his own peculiar manner, and making history to suit himself--a style\\nof procedure pursued, by the way, by the greatest historians of all ages\\nand nations.\\n\\nThe topic of discourse was, naturally, the aerial voyage. Joe had\\nexperienced some trouble in getting the rebellious spirits to believe in\\nit; but, once accepted by them, nothing connected with it was any longer\\nan impossibility to the imaginations of the seamen stimulated by Joe\\'s\\nharangues.\\n\\nOur dazzling narrator persuaded his hearers that, after this trip, many\\nothers still more wonderful would be undertaken. In fact, it was to be\\nbut the first of a long series of superhuman expeditions.\\n\\n\"You see, my friends, when a man has had a taste of that kind of\\ntravelling, he can\\'t get along afterward with any other; so, on our\\nnext expedition, instead of going off to one side, we\\'ll go right ahead,\\ngoing up, too, all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Humph! then you\\'ll go to the moon!\" said one of the crowd, with a stare\\nof amazement.\\n\\n\"To the moon!\" exclaimed Joe, \"To the moon! pooh! that\\'s too common.\\nEvery body might go to the moon, that way. Besides, there\\'s no water\\nthere, and you have to carry such a lot of it along with you. Then you\\nhave to take air along in bottles, so as to breathe.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! ay! that\\'s all right! But can a man get a drop of the real stuff\\nthere?\" said a sailor who liked his toddy.\\n\\n\"Not a drop!\" was Joe\\'s answer. \"No! old fellow, not in the moon. But\\nwe\\'re going to skip round among those little twinklers up there--the\\nstars--and the splendid planets that my old man so often talks about.\\nFor instance, we\\'ll commence with Saturn--\"\\n\\n\"That one with the ring?\" asked the boatswain.\\n\\n\"Yes! the wedding-ring--only no one knows what\\'s become of his wife!\"\\n\\n\"What? will you go so high up as that?\" said one of the ship-boys,\\ngaping with wonder. \"Why, your master must be Old Nick himself.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! no, he\\'s too good for that.\"\\n\\n\"But, after Saturn--what then?\" was the next inquiry of his impatient\\naudience.\\n\\n\"After Saturn? Well, we\\'ll visit Jupiter. A funny place that is, too,\\nwhere the days are only nine hours and a half long--a good thing for the\\nlazy fellows--and the years, would you believe it--last twelve of ours,\\nwhich is fine for folks who have only six months to live. They get off a\\nlittle longer by that.\"\\n\\n\"Twelve years!\" ejaculated the boy.\\n\\n\"Yes, my youngster; so that in that country you\\'d be toddling after your\\nmammy yet, and that old chap yonder, who looks about fifty, would only\\nbe a little shaver of four and a half.\"\\n\\n\"Blazes! that\\'s a good \\'un!\" shouted the whole forecastle together.\\n\\n\"Solemn truth!\" said Joe, stoutly.\\n\\n\"But what can you expect? When people will stay in this world, they\\nlearn nothing and keep as ignorant as bears. But just come along to\\nJupiter and you\\'ll see. But they have to look out up there, for he\\'s got\\nsatellites that are not just the easiest things to pass.\"\\n\\nAll the men laughed, but they more than half believed him. Then he went\\non to talk about Neptune, where seafaring men get a jovial reception,\\nand Mars, where the military get the best of the sidewalk to such an\\nextent that folks can hardly stand it. Finally, he drew them a heavenly\\npicture of the delights of Venus.\\n\\n\"And when we get back from that expedition,\" said the indefatigable\\nnarrator, \"they\\'ll decorate us with the Southern Cross that shines up\\nthere in the Creator\\'s button-hole.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, and you\\'d have well earned it!\" said the sailors.\\n\\nThus passed the long evenings on the forecastle in merry chat, and\\nduring the same time the doctor went on with his instructive discourses.\\n\\nOne day the conversation turned upon the means of directing balloons,\\nand the doctor was asked his opinion about it.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think,\" said he, \"that we shall succeed in finding out a\\nsystem of directing them. I am familiar with all the plans attempted\\nand proposed, and not one has succeeded, not one is practicable. You may\\nreadily understand that I have occupied my mind with this subject, which\\nwas, necessarily, so interesting to me, but I have not been able to\\nsolve the problem with the appliances now known to mechanical science.\\nWe would have to discover a motive power of extraordinary force, and\\nalmost impossible lightness of machinery. And, even then, we could not\\nresist atmospheric currents of any considerable strength. Until now, the\\neffort has been rather to direct the car than the balloon, and that has\\nbeen one great error.\"\\n\\n\"Still there are many points of resemblance between a balloon and a ship\\nwhich is directed at will.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" retorted the doctor, \"there is little or no similarity\\nbetween the two cases. Air is infinitely less dense than water, in which\\nthe ship is only half submerged, while the whole bulk of a balloon is\\nplunged in the atmosphere, and remains motionless with reference to the\\nelement that surrounds it.\"\\n\\n\"You think, then, that aerostatic science has said its last word?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all! not at all! But we must look for another point in the case,\\nand if we cannot manage to guide our balloon, we must, at least, try to\\nkeep it in favorable aerial currents. In proportion as we ascend,\\nthe latter become much more uniform and flow more constantly in one\\ndirection. They are no longer disturbed by the mountains and valleys\\nthat traverse the surface of the globe, and these, you know, are the\\nchief cause of the variations of the wind and the inequality of their\\nforce. Therefore, these zones having been once determined, the balloon\\nwill merely have to be placed in the currents best adapted to its\\ndestination.\"\\n\\n\"But then,\" continued Captain Bennet, \"in order to reach them, you must\\nkeep constantly ascending or descending. That is the real difficulty,\\ndoctor.\"\\n\\n\"And why, my dear captain?\"\\n\\n\"Let us understand one another. It would be a difficulty and an obstacle\\nonly for long journeys, and not for short aerial excursions.\"\\n\\n\"And why so, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Because you can ascend only by throwing out ballast; you can descend\\nonly after letting off gas, and by these processes your ballast and your\\ngas are soon exhausted.\"\\n\\n\"My dear sir, that\\'s the whole question. There is the only difficulty\\nthat science need now seek to overcome. The problem is not how to guide\\nthe balloon, but how to take it up and down without expending the\\ngas which is its strength, its life-blood, its soul, if I may use the\\nexpression.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my dear doctor; but this problem is not yet solved; this\\nmeans has not yet been discovered.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, it HAS been discovered.\"\\n\\n\"By whom?\"\\n\\n\"By me!\"\\n\\n\"By you?\"\\n\\n\"You may readily believe that otherwise I should not have risked this\\nexpedition across Africa in a balloon. In twenty-four hours I should\\nhave been without gas!\"\\n\\n\"But you said nothing about that in England?\"\\n\\n\"No! I did not want to have myself overhauled in public. I saw no use in\\nthat. I made my preparatory experiments in secret and was satisfied. I\\nhave no occasion, then, to learn any thing more from them.\"\\n\\n\"Well! doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?\"\\n\\n\"Here it is, gentlemen--the simplest thing in the world!\"\\n\\nThe attention of his auditory was now directed to the doctor in the\\nutmost degree as he quietly proceeded with his explanation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TENTH.\\n\\nFormer Experiments.--The Doctor\\'s Five Receptacles.--The Gas\\nCylinder.--The Calorifere.--The System of Manoeuvring.--Success certain.\\n\\n\"The attempt has often been made, gentlemen,\" said the doctor, \"to rise\\nand descend at will, without losing ballast or gas from the balloon. A\\nFrench aeronaut, M. Meunier, tried to accomplish this by compressing air\\nin an inner receptacle. A Belgian, Dr. Van Hecke, by means of wings\\nand paddles, obtained a vertical power that would have sufficed in most\\ncases, but the practical results secured from these experiments have\\nbeen insignificant.\\n\\n\"I therefore resolved to go about the thing more directly; so, at the\\nstart, I dispensed with ballast altogether, excepting as a provision for\\ncases of special emergency, such as the breakage of my apparatus, or\\nthe necessity of ascending very suddenly, so as to avoid unforeseen\\nobstacles.\\n\\n\"My means of ascent and descent consist simply in dilating or\\ncontracting the gas that is in the balloon by the application of\\ndifferent temperatures, and here is the method of obtaining that result.\\n\\n\"You saw me bring on board with the car several cases or receptacles,\\nthe use of which you may not have understood. They are five in number.\\n\\n\"The first contains about twenty-five gallons of water, to which I add\\na few drops of sulphuric acid, so as to augment its capacity as a\\nconductor of electricity, and then I decompose it by means of a powerful\\nBuntzen battery. Water, as you know, consists of two parts of hydrogen\\nto one of oxygen gas.\\n\\n\"The latter, through the action of the battery, passes at its positive\\npole into the second receptacle. A third receptacle, placed above the\\nsecond one, and of double its capacity, receives the hydrogen passing\\ninto it by the negative pole.\\n\\n\"Stopcocks, of which one has an orifice twice the size of the other,\\ncommunicate between these receptacles and a fourth one, which is\\ncalled the mixture reservoir, since in it the two gases obtained by the\\ndecomposition of the water do really commingle. The capacity of this\\nfourth tank is about forty-one cubic feet.\\n\\n\"On the upper part of this tank is a platinum tube provided with a\\nstopcock.\\n\\n\"You will now readily understand, gentlemen, the apparatus that I have\\ndescribed to you is really a gas cylinder and blow-pipe for oxygen and\\nhydrogen, the heat of which exceeds that of a forge fire.\\n\\n\"This much established, I proceed to the second part of my apparatus.\\nFrom the lowest part of my balloon, which is hermetically closed, issue\\ntwo tubes a little distance apart. The one starts among the upper layers\\nof the hydrogen gas, the other amid the lower layers.\\n\\n\"These two pipes are provided at intervals with strong jointings of\\nindia-rubber, which enable them to move in harmony with the oscillations\\nof the balloon.\\n\\n\"Both of them run down as far as the car, and lose themselves in an\\niron receptacle of cylindrical form, which is called the heat-tank. The\\nlatter is closed at its two ends by two strong plates of the same metal.\\n\\n\"The pipe running from the lower part of the balloon runs into this\\ncylindrical receptacle through the lower plate; it penetrates the latter\\nand then takes the form of a helicoidal or screw-shaped spiral, the\\nrings of which, rising one over the other, occupy nearly the whole of\\nthe height of the tank. Before again issuing from it, this spiral runs\\ninto a small cone with a concave base, that is turned downward in the\\nshape of a spherical cap.\\n\\n\"It is from the top of this cone that the second pipe issues, and it\\nruns, as I have said, into the upper beds of the balloon.\\n\\n\"The spherical cap of the small cone is of platinum, so as not to melt\\nby the action of the cylinder and blow-pipe, for the latter are placed\\nupon the bottom of the iron tank in the midst of the helicoidal\\nspiral, and the extremity of their flame will slightly touch the cap in\\nquestion.\\n\\n\"You all know, gentlemen, what a calorifere, to heat apartments, is. You\\nknow how it acts. The air of the apartments is forced to pass through\\nits pipes, and is then released with a heightened temperature. Well,\\nwhat I have just described to you is nothing more nor less than a\\ncalorifere.\\n\\n\"In fact, what is it that takes place? The cylinder once lighted, the\\nhydrogen in the spiral and in the concave cone becomes heated, and\\nrapidly ascends through the pipe that leads to the upper part of the\\nballoon. A vacuum is created below, and it attracts the gas in the lower\\nparts; this becomes heated in its turn, and is continually replaced;\\nthus, an extremely rapid current of gas is established in the pipes and\\nin the spiral, which issues from the balloon and then returns to it, and\\nis heated over again, incessantly.\\n\\n\"Now, the cases increase 1/480 of their volume for each degree of heat\\napplied. If, then, I force the temperature 18 degrees, the hydrogen of\\nthe balloon will dilate 18/480 or 1614 cubic feet, and will, therefore,\\ndisplace 1614 more cubic feet of air, which will increase its\\nascensional power by 160 pounds. This is equivalent to throwing out that\\nweight of ballast. If I augment the temperature by 180 degrees, the gas\\nwill dilate 180/480 and will displace 16,740 cubic feet more, and its\\nascensional force will be augmented by 1,600 pounds.\\n\\n\"Thus, you see, gentlemen, that I can easily effect very considerable\\nchanges of equilibrium. The volume of the balloon has been calculated\\nin such manner that, when half inflated, it displaces a weight of air\\nexactly equal to that of the envelope containing the hydrogen gas,\\nand of the car occupied by the passengers, and all its apparatus and\\naccessories. At this point of inflation, it is in exact equilibrium with\\nthe air, and neither mounts nor descends.\\n\\n\"In order, then, to effect an ascent, I give the gas a temperature\\nsuperior to the temperature of the surrounding air by means of my\\ncylinder. By this excess of heat it obtains a larger distention, and\\ninflates the balloon more. The latter, then, ascends in proportion as I\\nheat the hydrogen.\\n\\n\"The descent, of course, is effected by lowering the heat of the\\ncylinder, and letting the temperature abate. The ascent would\\nbe, usually, more rapid than the descent; but that is a fortunate\\ncircumstance, since it is of no importance to me to descend rapidly,\\nwhile, on the other hand, it is by a very rapid ascent that I avoid\\nobstacles. The real danger lurks below, and not above.\\n\\n\"Besides, as I have said, I have a certain quantity of ballast, which\\nwill enable me to ascend more rapidly still, when necessary. My valve,\\nat the top of the balloon, is nothing more nor less than a safety-valve.\\nThe balloon always retains the same quantity of hydrogen, and the\\nvariations of temperature that I produce in the midst of this shut-up\\ngas are, of themselves, sufficient to provide for all these ascending\\nand descending movements.\\n\\n\"Now, gentlemen, as a practical detail, let me add this:\\n\\n\"The combustion of the hydrogen and of the oxygen at the point of the\\ncylinder produces solely the vapor or steam of water. I have, therefore,\\nprovided the lower part of the cylindrical iron box with a scape-pipe,\\nwith a valve operating by means of a pressure of two atmospheres;\\nconsequently, so soon as this amount of pressure is attained, the steam\\nescapes of itself.\\n\\n\"Here are the exact figures: 25 gallons of water, separated into its\\nconstituent elements, yield 200 pounds of oxygen and 25 pounds of\\nhydrogen. This represents, at atmospheric tension, 1,800 cubic feet of\\nthe former and 3,780 cubic feet of the latter, or 5,670 cubic feet,\\nin all, of the mixture. Hence, the stopcock of my cylinder, when fully\\nopen, expends 27 cubic feet per hour, with a flame at least six times\\nas strong as that of the large lamps used for lighting streets. On an\\naverage, then, and in order to keep myself at a very moderate elevation,\\nI should not burn more than nine cubic feet per hour, so that my\\ntwenty-five gallons of water represent six hundred and thirty-six hours\\nof aerial navigation, or a little more than twenty-six days.\\n\\n\"Well, as I can descend when I please, to replenish my stock of water on\\nthe way, my trip might be indefinitely prolonged.\\n\\n\"Such, gentlemen, is my secret. It is simple, and, like most simple\\nthings, it cannot fail to succeed. The dilation and contraction of the\\ngas in the balloon is my means of locomotion, which calls for neither\\ncumbersome wings, nor any other mechanical motor. A calorifere to\\nproduce the changes of temperature, and a cylinder to generate the heat,\\nare neither inconvenient nor heavy. I think, therefore, that I have\\ncombined all the elements of success.\"\\n\\nDr. Ferguson here terminated his discourse, and was most heartily\\napplauded. There was not an objection to make to it; all had been\\nforeseen and decided.\\n\\n\"However,\" said the captain, \"the thing may prove dangerous.\"\\n\\n\"What matters that,\" replied the doctor, \"provided that it be\\npracticable?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVENTH.\\n\\nThe Arrival at Zanzibar.--The English Consul.--Ill-will of the\\nInhabitants.--The Island of Koumbeni.--The Rain-Makers.--Inflation of\\nthe Balloon.--Departure on the 18th of April.--The last Good-by.--The\\nVictoria.\\n\\nAn invariably favorable wind had accelerated the progress of the\\nResolute toward the place of her destination. The navigation of the\\nMozambique Channel was especially calm and pleasant. The agreeable\\ncharacter of the trip by sea was regarded as a good omen of the probable\\nissue of the trip through the air. Every one looked forward to the\\nhour of arrival, and sought to give the last touch to the doctor\\'s\\npreparations.\\n\\nAt length the vessel hove in sight of the town of Zanzibar, upon the\\nisland of the same name, and, on the 15th of April, at 11 o\\'clock in the\\nmorning, she anchored in the port.\\n\\nThe island of Zanzibar belongs to the Imaum of Muscat, an ally of France\\nand England, and is, undoubtedly, his finest settlement. The port is\\nfrequented by a great many vessels from the neighboring countries.\\n\\nThe island is separated from the African coast only by a channel, the\\ngreatest width of which is but thirty miles.\\n\\nIt has a large trade in gums, ivory, and, above all, in \"ebony,\" for\\nZanzibar is the great slave-market. Thither converges all the booty\\ncaptured in the battles which the chiefs of the interior are continually\\nfighting. This traffic extends along the whole eastern coast, and as far\\nas the Nile latitudes. Mr. G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it\\ncarried on, openly, under the French flag.\\n\\nUpon the arrival of the Resolute, the English consul at Zanzibar came\\non board to offer his services to the doctor, of whose projects the\\nEuropean newspapers had made him aware for a month past. But, up to that\\nmoment, he had remained with the numerous phalanx of the incredulous.\\n\\n\"I doubted,\" said he, holding out his hand to Dr. Ferguson, \"but now I\\ndoubt no longer.\"\\n\\nHe invited the doctor, Kennedy, and the faithful Joe, of course, to\\nhis own dwelling. Through his courtesy, the doctor was enabled to have\\nknowledge of the various letters that he had received from Captain\\nSpeke. The captain and his companions had suffered dreadfully from\\nhunger and bad weather before reaching the Ugogo country. They could\\nadvance only with extreme difficulty, and did not expect to be able to\\ncommunicate again for a long time.\\n\\n\"Those are perils and privations which we shall manage to avoid,\" said\\nthe doctor.\\n\\nThe baggage of the three travellers was conveyed to the consul\\'s\\nresidence. Arrangements were made for disembarking the balloon upon the\\nbeach at Zanzibar. There was a convenient spot, near the signal-mast,\\nclose by an immense building, that would serve to shelter it from the\\neast winds. This huge tower, resembling a tun standing on one end,\\nbeside which the famous Heidelberg tun would have seemed but a very\\nordinary barrel, served as a fortification, and on its platform were\\nstationed Belootchees, armed with lances. These Belootchees are a kind\\nof brawling, good-for-nothing Janizaries.\\n\\nBut, when about to land the balloon, the consul was informed that the\\npopulation of the island would oppose their doing so by force.\\nNothing is so blind as fanatical passion. The news of the arrival of a\\nChristian, who was to ascend into the air, was received with rage. The\\nnegroes, more exasperated than the Arabs, saw in this project an attack\\nupon their religion. They took it into their heads that some mischief\\nwas meant to the sun and the moon. Now, these two luminaries are objects\\nof veneration to the African tribes, and they determined to oppose so\\nsacrilegious an enterprise.\\n\\nThe consul, informed of their intentions, conferred with Dr. Ferguson\\nand Captain Bennet on the subject. The latter was unwilling to yield\\nto threats, but his friend dissuaded him from any idea of violent\\nretaliation.\\n\\n\"We shall certainly come out winners,\" he said. \"Even the imaum\\'s\\nsoldiers will lend us a hand, if we need it. But, my dear captain, an\\naccident may happen in a moment, and it would require but one unlucky\\nblow to do the balloon an irreparable injury, so that the trip would be\\ntotally defeated; therefore we must act with the greatest caution.\"\\n\\n\"But what are we to do? If we land on the coast of Africa, we shall\\nencounter the same difficulties. What are we to do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is more simple,\" replied the consul. \"You observe those small\\nislands outside of the port; land your balloon on one of them; surround\\nit with a guard of sailors, and you will have no risk to run.\"\\n\\n\"Just the thing!\" said the doctor, \"and we shall be entirely at our ease\\nin completing our preparations.\"\\n\\nThe captain yielded to these suggestions, and the Resolute was headed\\nfor the island of Koumbeni. During the morning of the 16th April, the\\nballoon was placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great\\nwoods, with which the soil is studded.\\n\\nTwo masts, eighty feet in height, were raised at the same distance from\\neach other. Blocks and tackle, placed at their extremities, afforded the\\nmeans of elevating the balloon, by the aid of a transverse rope. It\\nwas then entirely uninflated. The interior balloon was fastened to the\\nexterior one, in such manner as to be lifted up in the same way. To the\\nlower end of each balloon were fixed the pipes that served to introduce\\nthe hydrogen gas.\\n\\nThe whole day, on the 17th, was spent in arranging the apparatus\\ndestined to produce the gas; it consisted of some thirty casks, in which\\nthe decomposition of water was effected by means of iron-filings and\\nsulphuric acid placed together in a large quantity of the first-named\\nfluid. The hydrogen passed into a huge central cask, after having been\\nwashed on the way, and thence into each balloon by the conduit-pipes.\\nIn this manner each of them received a certain accurately-ascertained\\nquantity of gas. For this purpose, there had to be employed eighteen\\nhundred and sixty-six pounds of sulphuric acid, sixteen thousand and\\nfifty pounds of iron, and nine thousand one hundred and sixty-six\\ngallons of water. This operation commenced on the following night, about\\nthree A.M., and lasted nearly eight hours. The next day, the balloon,\\ncovered with its network, undulated gracefully above its car, which was\\nheld to the ground by numerous sacks of earth. The inflating apparatus\\nwas put together with extreme care, and the pipes issuing from the\\nballoon were securely fitted to the cylindrical case.\\n\\nThe anchors, the cordage, the instruments, the travelling-wraps, the\\nawning, the provisions, and the arms, were put in the place assigned to\\nthem in the car. The supply of water was procured at Zanzibar. The two\\nhundred pounds of ballast were distributed in fifty bags placed at the\\nbottom of the car, but within arm\\'s-reach.\\n\\nThese preparations were concluded about five o\\'clock in the evening,\\nwhile sentinels kept close watch around the island, and the boats of the\\nResolute patrolled the channel.\\n\\nThe blacks continued to show their displeasure by grimaces and\\ncontortions. Their obi-men, or wizards, went up and down among the angry\\nthrongs, pouring fuel on the flame of their fanaticism; and some of the\\nexcited wretches, more furious and daring than the rest, attempted to\\nget to the island by swimming, but they were easily driven off.\\n\\nThereupon the sorceries and incantations commenced; the \"rain-makers,\"\\nwho pretend to have control over the clouds, invoked the storms and the\\n\"stone-showers,\" as the blacks call hail, to their aid. To compel them\\nto do so, they plucked leaves of all the different trees that grow in\\nthat country, and boiled them over a slow fire, while, at the same time,\\na sheep was killed by thrusting a long needle into its heart. But, in\\nspite of all their ceremonies, the sky remained clear and beautiful,\\nand they profited nothing by their slaughtered sheep and their ugly\\ngrimaces.\\n\\nThe blacks then abandoned themselves to the most furious orgies, and\\ngot fearfully drunk on \"tembo,\" a kind of ardent spirits drawn from\\nthe cocoa-nut tree, and an extremely heady sort of beer called \"togwa.\"\\nTheir chants, which were destitute of all melody, but were sung in\\nexcellent time, continued until far into the night.\\n\\nAbout six o\\'clock in the evening, the captain assembled the travellers\\nand the officers of the ship at a farewell repast in his cabin. Kennedy,\\nwhom nobody ventured to question now, sat with his eyes riveted on Dr.\\nFerguson, murmuring indistinguishable words. In other respects, the\\ndinner was a gloomy one. The approach of the final moment filled\\neverybody with the most serious reflections. What had fate in store for\\nthese daring adventurers? Should they ever again find themselves in the\\nmidst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth? Were their\\ntravelling apparatus to fail, what would become of them, among those\\nferocious savage tribes, in regions that had never been explored, and in\\nthe midst of boundless deserts?\\n\\nSuch thoughts as these, which had been dim and vague until then, or but\\nslightly regarded when they came up, returned upon their excited fancies\\nwith intense force at this parting moment. Dr. Ferguson, still cold and\\nimpassible, talked of this, that, and the other; but he strove in vain\\nto overcome this infectious gloominess. He utterly failed.\\n\\nAs some demonstration against the personal safety of the doctor and his\\ncompanions was feared, all three slept that night on board the Resolute.\\nAt six o\\'clock in the morning they left their cabin, and landed on the\\nisland of Koumbeni.\\n\\nThe balloon was swaying gently to and fro in the morning breeze;\\nthe sand-bags that had held it down were now replaced by some twenty\\nstrong-armed sailors, and Captain Bennet and his officers were present\\nto witness the solemn departure of their friends.\\n\\nAt this moment Kennedy went right up to the doctor, grasped his hand,\\nand said:\\n\\n\"Samuel, have you absolutely determined to go?\"\\n\\n\"Solemnly determined, my dear Dick.\"\\n\\n\"I have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I\\nnot?\"\\n\\n\"Every thing!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, my conscience is clear on that score, and I will go with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"I was sure you would!\" said the doctor, betraying in his features swift\\ntraces of emotion.\\n\\nAt last the moment of final leave-taking arrived. The captain and\\nhis officers embraced their dauntless friends with great feeling, not\\nexcepting even Joe, who, worthy fellow, was as proud and happy as a\\nprince. Every one in the party insisted upon having a final shake of the\\ndoctor\\'s hand.\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock the three travellers got into their car. The doctor lit\\nthe combustible in his cylinder and turned the flame so as to produce a\\nrapid heat, and the balloon, which had rested on the ground in perfect\\nequipoise, began to rise in a few minutes, so that the seamen had to\\nslacken the ropes they held it by. The car then rose about twenty feet\\nabove their heads.\\n\\n\"My friends!\" exclaimed the doctor, standing up between his two\\ncompanions, and taking off his hat, \"let us give our aerial ship a name\\nthat will bring her good luck! let us christen her Victoria!\"\\n\\nThis speech was answered with stentorian cheers of \"Huzza for the Queen!\\nHuzza for Old England!\"\\n\\nAt this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased\\nprodigiously, and Ferguson, Kennedy, and Joe, waved a last good-by to\\ntheir friends.\\n\\n\"Let go all!\" shouted the doctor, and at the word the Victoria shot\\nrapidly up into the sky, while the four carronades on board the Resolute\\nthundered forth a parting salute in her honor.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELFTH\\n\\nCrossing the Strait.--The Mrima.--Dick\\'s Remark and Joe\\'s\\nProposition.--A Recipe for Coffee-making.--The Uzaramo.--The Unfortunate\\nMaizan.--Mount Dathumi.--The Doctor\\'s Cards.--Night under a Nopal.\\n\\nThe air was pure, the wind moderate, and the balloon ascended almost\\nperpendicularly to a height of fifteen hundred feet, as indicated by a\\ndepression of two inches in the barometric column.\\n\\nAt this height a more decided current carried the balloon toward the\\nsouthwest. What a magnificent spectacle was then outspread beneath the\\ngaze of the travellers! The island of Zanzibar could be seen in its\\nentire extent, marked out by its deeper color upon a vast planisphere;\\nthe fields had the appearance of patterns of different colors, and thick\\nclumps of green indicated the groves and thickets.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of the island looked no larger than insects. The\\nhuzzaing and shouting were little by little lost in the distance, and\\nonly the discharge of the ship\\'s guns could be heard in the concavity\\nbeneath the balloon, as the latter sped on its flight.\\n\\n\"How fine that is!\" said Joe, breaking silence for the first time.\\n\\nHe got no reply. The doctor was busy observing the variations of the\\nbarometer and noting down the details of his ascent.\\n\\nKennedy looked on, and had not eyes enough to take in all that he saw.\\n\\nThe rays of the sun coming to the aid of the heating cylinder, the\\ntension of the gas increased, and the Victoria attained the height of\\ntwenty-five hundred feet.\\n\\nThe Resolute looked like a mere cockle-shell, and the African coast\\ncould be distinctly seen in the west marked out by a fringe of foam.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t talk?\" said Joe, again.\\n\\n\"We are looking!\" said the doctor, directing his spy-glass toward the\\nmainland.\\n\\n\"For my part, I must talk!\"\\n\\n\"As much as you please, Joe; talk as much as you like!\"\\n\\nAnd Joe went on alone with a tremendous volley of exclamations. The\\n\"ohs!\" and the \"ahs!\" exploded one after the other, incessantly, from\\nhis lips.\\n\\nDuring his passage over the sea the doctor deemed it best to keep at his\\npresent elevation. He could thus reconnoitre a greater stretch of the\\ncoast. The thermometer and the barometer, hanging up inside of the\\nhalf-opened awning, were always within sight, and a second barometer\\nsuspended outside was to serve during the night watches.\\n\\nAt the end of about two hours the Victoria, driven along at a speed of\\na little more than eight miles, very visibly neared the coast of the\\nmainland. The doctor, thereupon, determined to descend a little nearer\\nto the ground. So he moderated the flame of his cylinder, and the\\nballoon, in a few moments, had descended to an altitude only three\\nhundred feet above the soil.\\n\\nIt was then found to be passing just over the Mrima country, the name of\\nthis part of the eastern coast of Africa. Dense borders of mango-trees\\nprotected its margin, and the ebb-tide disclosed to view their thick\\nroots, chafed and gnawed by the teeth of the Indian Ocean. The sands\\nwhich, at an earlier period, formed the coast-line, rounded away along\\nthe distant horizon, and Mount Nguru reared aloft its sharp summit in\\nthe northwest.\\n\\nThe Victoria passed near to a village which the doctor found marked upon\\nhis chart as Kaole. Its entire population had assembled in crowds, and\\nwere yelling with anger and fear, at the same time vainly directing\\ntheir arrows against this monster of the air that swept along so\\nmajestically away above all their powerless fury.\\n\\nThe wind was setting to the southward, but the doctor felt no concern on\\nthat score, since it enabled him the better to follow the route traced\\nby Captains Burton and Speke.\\n\\nKennedy had, at length, become as talkative as Joe, and the two kept up\\na continual interchange of admiring interjections and exclamations.\\n\\n\"Out upon stage-coaches!\" said one.\\n\\n\"Steamers indeed!\" said the other.\\n\\n\"Railroads! eh? rubbish!\" put in Kennedy, \"that you travel on, without\\nseeing the country!\"\\n\\n\"Balloons! they\\'re the sort for me!\" Joe would add. \"Why, you don\\'t\\nfeel yourself going, and Nature takes the trouble to spread herself out\\nbefore one\\'s eyes!\"\\n\\n\"What a splendid sight! What a spectacle! What a delight! a dream in a\\nhammock!\"\\n\\n\"Suppose we take our breakfast?\" was Joe\\'s unpoetical change of tune, at\\nlast, for the keen, open air had mightily sharpened his appetite.\\n\\n\"Good idea, my boy!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it won\\'t take us long to do the cooking--biscuit and potted meat?\"\\n\\n\"And as much coffee as you like,\" said the doctor. \"I give you leave to\\nborrow a little heat from my cylinder. There\\'s enough and to spare, for\\nthat matter, and so we shall avoid the risk of a conflagration.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a dreadful misfortune!\" ejaculated Kennedy. \"It\\'s the\\nsame as a powder-magazine suspended over our heads.\"\\n\\n\"Not precisely,\" said Ferguson, \"but still if the gas were to take fire\\nit would burn up gradually, and we should settle down on the ground,\\nwhich would be disagreeable; but never fear--our balloon is hermetically\\nsealed.\"\\n\\n\"Let us eat a bite, then,\" replied Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" put in Joe, \"while doing the same as you, I\\'m going\\nto get you up a cup of coffee that I think you\\'ll have something to say\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" added the doctor, \"that Joe, along with a thousand other\\nvirtues, has a remarkable talent for the preparation of that delicious\\nbeverage: he compounds it of a mixture of various origin, but he never\\nwould reveal to me the ingredients.\"\\n\\n\"Well, master, since we are so far above-ground, I can tell you the\\nsecret. It is just to mix equal quantities of Mocha, of Bourbon coffee,\\nand of Rio Nunez.\"\\n\\nA few moments later, three steaming cups of coffee were served, and\\ntopped off a substantial breakfast, which was additionally seasoned by\\nthe jokes and repartees of the guests. Each one then resumed his post of\\nobservation.\\n\\nThe country over which they were passing was remarkable for its\\nfertility. Narrow, winding paths plunged in beneath the overarching\\nverdure. They swept along above cultivated fields of tobacco, maize, and\\nbarley, at full maturity, and here and there immense rice-fields, full\\nof straight stalks and purple blossoms. They could distinguish sheep and\\ngoats too, confined in large cages, set up on piles to keep them out\\nof reach of the leopards\\' fangs. Luxuriant vegetation spread in wild\\nprofuseness over this prodigal soil.\\n\\nVillage after village rang with yells of terror and astonishment at the\\nsight of the Victoria, and Dr. Ferguson prudently kept her above the\\nreach of the barbarian arrows. The savages below, thus baffled, ran\\ntogether from their huddle of huts and followed the travellers with\\ntheir vain imprecations while they remained in sight.\\n\\nAt noon, the doctor, upon consulting his map, calculated that they were\\npassing over the Uzaramo* country. The soil was thickly studded with\\ncocoa-nut, papaw, and cotton-wood trees, above which the balloon seemed\\nto disport itself like a bird. Joe found this splendid vegetation a\\nmatter of course, seeing that they were in Africa. Kennedy descried some\\nhares and quails that asked nothing better than to get a good shot from\\nhis fowling-piece, but it would have been powder wasted, since there was\\nno time to pick up the game.\\n\\n     * U and Ou signify country in the language of that region.\\n\\nThe aeronauts swept on with the speed of twelve miles per hour, and soon\\nwere passing in thirty-eight degrees twenty minutes east longitude, over\\nthe village of Tounda.\\n\\n\"It was there,\" said the doctor, \"that Burton and Speke were seized with\\nviolent fevers, and for a moment thought their expedition ruined. And\\nyet they were only a short distance from the coast, but fatigue and\\nprivation were beginning to tell upon them severely.\"\\n\\nIn fact, there is a perpetual malaria reigning throughout the country\\nin question. Even the doctor could hope to escape its effects only by\\nrising above the range of the miasma that exhales from this damp region\\nwhence the blazing rays of the sun pump up its poisonous vapors. Once in\\na while they could descry a caravan resting in a \"kraal,\" awaiting the\\nfreshness and cool of the evening to resume its route. These kraals are\\nwide patches of cleared land, surrounded by hedges and jungles, where\\ntraders take shelter against not only the wild beasts, but also the\\nrobber tribes of the country. They could see the natives running and\\nscattering in all directions at the sight of the Victoria. Kennedy was\\nkeen to get a closer look at them, but the doctor invariably held out\\nagainst the idea.\\n\\n\"The chiefs are armed with muskets,\" he said, \"and our balloon would be\\ntoo conspicuous a mark for their bullets.\"\\n\\n\"Would a bullet-hole bring us down?\" asked Joe.\\n\\n\"Not immediately; but such a hole would soon become a large torn orifice\\nthrough which our gas would escape.\"\\n\\n\"Then, let us keep at a respectful distance from yon miscreants. What\\nmust they think as they see us sailing in the air? I\\'m sure they must\\nfeel like worshipping us!\"\\n\\n\"Let them worship away, then,\" replied the doctor, \"but at a distance.\\nThere is no harm done in getting as far away from them as possible. See!\\nthe country is already changing its aspect: the villages are fewer and\\nfarther between; the mango-trees have disappeared, for their growth\\nceases at this latitude. The soil is becoming hilly and portends\\nmountains not far off.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Kennedy, \"it seems to me that I can see some high land on\\nthis side.\"\\n\\n\"In the west--those are the nearest ranges of the Ourizara--Mount\\nDuthumi, no doubt, behind which I hope to find shelter for the night.\\nI\\'ll stir up the heat in the cylinder a little, for we must keep at an\\nelevation of five or six hundred feet.\"\\n\\n\"That was a grant idea of yours, sir,\" said Joe. \"It\\'s mighty easy to\\nmanage it; you turn a cock, and the thing\\'s done.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! here we are more at our ease,\" said the sportsman, as the balloon\\nascended; \"the reflection of the sun on those red sands was getting to\\nbe insupportable.\"\\n\\n\"What splendid trees!\" cried Joe. \"They\\'re quite natural, but they are\\nvery fine! Why a dozen of them would make a forest!\"\\n\\n\"Those are baobabs,\" replied Dr. Ferguson. \"See, there\\'s one with a\\ntrunk fully one hundred feet in circumference. It was, perhaps, at the\\nfoot of that very tree that Maizan, the French traveller, expired in\\n1845, for we are over the village of Deje-la-Mhora, to which he pushed\\non alone. He was seized by the chief of this region, fastened to the\\nfoot of a baobab, and the ferocious black then severed all his joints\\nwhile the war-song of his tribe was chanted; he then made a gash in the\\nprisoner\\'s neck, stopped to sharpen his knife, and fairly tore away the\\npoor wretch\\'s head before it had been cut from the body. The unfortunate\\nFrenchman was but twenty-six years of age.\"\\n\\n\"And France has never avenged so hideous a crime?\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"France did demand satisfaction, and the Said of Zanzibar did all in his\\npower to capture the murderer, but in vain.\"\\n\\n\"I move that we don\\'t stop here!\" urged Joe; \"let us go up, master, let\\nus go up higher by all means.\"\\n\\n\"All the more willingly, Joe, that there is Mount Duthumi right ahead\\nof us. If my calculations be right we shall have passed it before seven\\no\\'clock in the evening.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we not travel at night?\" asked the Scotchman.\\n\\n\"No, as little as possible. With care and vigilance we might do so\\nsafely, but it is not enough to sweep across Africa. We want to see it.\"\\n\\n\"Up to this time we have nothing to complain of, master. The best\\ncultivated and most fertile country in the world instead of a desert!\\nBelieve the geographers after that!\"\\n\\n\"Let us wait, Joe! we shall see by-and-by.\"\\n\\nAbout half-past six in the evening the Victoria was directly opposite\\nMount Duthumi; in order to pass, it had to ascend to a height of more\\nthan three thousand feet, and to accomplish that the doctor had only to\\nraise the temperature of his gas eighteen degrees. It might have been\\ncorrectly said that he held his balloon in his hand. Kennedy had only\\nto indicate to him the obstacles to be surmounted, and the Victoria sped\\nthrough the air, skimming the summits of the range.\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock it descended the farther slope, the acclivity of which\\nwas much less abrupt. The anchors were thrown out from the car and\\none of them, coming in contact with the branches of an enormous nopal,\\ncaught on it firmly. Joe at once let himself slide down the rope and\\nsecured it. The silk ladder was then lowered to him and he remounted\\nto the car with agility. The balloon now remained perfectly at rest\\nsheltered from the eastern winds.\\n\\nThe evening meal was got ready, and the aeronauts, excited by their\\nday\\'s journey, made a heavy onslaught upon the provisions.\\n\\n\"What distance have we traversed to-day?\" asked Kennedy, disposing of\\nsome alarming mouthfuls.\\n\\nThe doctor took his bearings, by means of lunar observations, and\\nconsulted the excellent map that he had with him for his guidance. It\\nbelonged to the Atlas of \"Der Neuester Endeckungen in Afrika\" (\"The\\nLatest Discoveries in Africa\"), published at Gotha by his learned friend\\nDr. Petermann, and by that savant sent to him. This Atlas was to serve\\nthe doctor on his whole journey; for it contained the itinerary of\\nBurton and Speke to the great lakes; the Soudan, according to Dr. Barth;\\nthe Lower Senegal, according to Guillaume Lejean; and the Delta of the\\nNiger, by Dr. Blaikie.\\n\\nFerguson had also provided himself with a work which combined in one\\ncompilation all the notions already acquired concerning the Nile. It was\\nentitled \"The Sources of the Nile; being a General Survey of the Basin\\nof that River and of its Head-Stream, with the History of the Nilotic\\nDiscovery, by Charles Beke, D.D.\"\\n\\nHe also had the excellent charts published in the \"Bulletins of the\\nGeographical Society of London;\" and not a single point of the countries\\nalready discovered could, therefore, escape his notice.\\n\\nUpon tracing on his maps, he found that his latitudinal route had been\\ntwo degrees, or one hundred and twenty miles, to the westward.\\n\\nKennedy remarked that the route tended toward the south; but this\\ndirection was satisfactory to the doctor, who desired to reconnoitre the\\ntracks of his predecessors as much as possible. It was agreed that the\\nnight should be divided into three watches, so that each of the party\\nshould take his turn in watching over the safety of the rest. The doctor\\ntook the watch commencing at nine o\\'clock; Kennedy, the one commencing\\nat midnight; and Joe, the three o\\'clock morning watch.\\n\\nSo Kennedy and Joe, well wrapped in their blankets, stretched themselves\\nat full length under the awning, and slept quietly; while Dr. Ferguson\\nkept on the lookout.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEENTH.\\n\\nChange of Weather.--Kennedy has the Fever.--The Doctor\\'s\\nMedicine.--Travels on Land.--The Basin of Imenge.--Mount Rubeho.--Six\\nThousand Feet Elevation.--A Halt in the Daytime.\\n\\nThe night was calm. However, on Saturday morning, Kennedy, as he awoke,\\ncomplained of lassitude and feverish chills. The weather was changing.\\nThe sky, covered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a\\nfresh deluge. A gloomy region is that Zungomoro country, where it rains\\ncontinually, excepting, perhaps, for a couple of weeks in the month of\\nJanuary.\\n\\nA violent shower was not long in drenching our travellers. Below them,\\nthe roads, intersected by \"nullahs,\" a sort of instantaneous torrent,\\nwere soon rendered impracticable, entangled as they were, besides, with\\nthorny thickets and gigantic lianas, or creeping vines. The sulphuretted\\nhydrogen emanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly\\nsmelt.\\n\\n\"According to his statement, and I think he\\'s right,\" said the doctor,\\n\"one could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden behind every\\nthicket.\"\\n\\n\"An ugly country this!\" sighed Joe; \"and it seems to me that Mr. Kennedy\\nis none the better for having passed the night in it.\"\\n\\n\"To tell the truth, I have quite a high fever,\" said the sportsman.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in one\\nof the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here\\nlong; so let\\'s be off.\"\\n\\nThanks to a skilful manoeuvre achieved by Joe, the anchor was\\ndisengaged, and Joe reascended to the car by means of the ladder. The\\ndoctor vigorously dilated the gas, and the Victoria resumed her flight,\\ndriven along by a spanking breeze.\\n\\nOnly a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists;\\nbut the appearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in\\nAfrica that some of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others\\nthat are perfectly salubrious.\\n\\nKennedy was visibly suffering, and the fever was mastering his vigorous\\nconstitution.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t do to fall ill, though,\" he grumbled; and so saying, he\\nwrapped himself in a blanket, and lay down under the awning.\\n\\n\"A little patience, Dick, and you\\'ll soon get over this,\" said the\\ndoctor.\\n\\n\"Get over it! Egad, Samuel, if you\\'ve any drug in your travelling-chest\\nthat will set me on my feet again, bring it without delay. I\\'ll swallow\\nit with my eyes shut!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I can do better than that, friend Dick; for I can give you a\\nfebrifuge that won\\'t cost any thing.\"\\n\\n\"And how will you do that?\"\\n\\n\"Very easily. I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that\\nare now deluging us, and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere. I\\nask for only ten minutes, in order to dilate the hydrogen.\"\\n\\nThe ten minutes had scarcely elapsed ere the travellers were beyond the\\nrainy belt of country.\\n\\n\"Wait a little, now, Dick, and you\\'ll begin to feel the effect of pure\\nair and sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a cure for you!\" said Joe; \"why, it\\'s wonderful!\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s merely natural.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! natural; yes, no doubt of that!\"\\n\\n\"I bring Dick into good air, as the doctors do, every day, in Europe,\\nor, as I would send a patient at Martinique to the Pitons, a lofty\\nmountain on that island, to get clear of the yellow fever.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! by Jove, this balloon is a paradise!\" exclaimed Kennedy, feeling\\nmuch better already.\\n\\n\"It leads to it, anyhow!\" replied Joe, quite gravely.\\n\\nIt was a curious spectacle--that mass of clouds piled up, at the moment,\\naway below them! The vapors rolled over each other, and mingled together\\nin confused masses of superb brilliance, as they reflected the rays of\\nthe sun. The Victoria had attained an altitude of four thousand feet,\\nand the thermometer indicated a certain diminution of temperature. The\\nland below could no longer be seen. Fifty miles away to the westward,\\nMount Rubeho raised its sparkling crest, marking the limit of the Ugogo\\ncountry in east longitude thirty-six degrees twenty minutes. The wind\\nwas blowing at the rate of twenty miles an hour, but the aeronauts felt\\nnothing of this increased speed. They observed no jar, and had scarcely\\nany sense of motion at all.\\n\\nThree hours later, the doctor\\'s prediction was fully verified. Kennedy\\nno longer felt a single shiver of the fever, but partook of some\\nbreakfast with an excellent appetite.\\n\\n\"That beats sulphate of quinine!\" said the energetic Scot, with hearty\\nemphasis and much satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Positively,\" said Joe, \"this is where I\\'ll have to retire to when I get\\nold!\"\\n\\nAbout ten o\\'clock in the morning the atmosphere cleared up, the clouds\\nparted, and the country beneath could again be seen, the Victoria\\nmeanwhile rapidly descending. Dr. Ferguson was in search of a current\\nthat would carry him more to the northeast, and he found it about six\\nhundred feet from the ground. The country was becoming more broken, and\\neven mountainous. The Zungomoro district was fading out of sight in the\\neast with the last cocoa-nut-trees of that latitude.\\n\\nEre long, the crests of a mountain-range assumed a more decided\\nprominence. A few peaks rose here and there, and it became necessary\\nto keep a sharp lookout for the pointed cones that seemed to spring up\\nevery moment.\\n\\n\"We\\'re right among the breakers!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Keep cool, Dick. We shan\\'t touch them,\" was the doctor\\'s quiet answer.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a jolly way to travel, anyhow!\" said Joe, with his usual flow of\\nspirits.\\n\\nIn fact, the doctor managed his balloon with wondrous dexterity.\\n\\n\"Now, if we had been compelled to go afoot over that drenched soil,\"\\nsaid he, \"we should still be dragging along in a pestilential mire.\\nSince our departure from Zanzibar, half our beasts of burden would\\nhave died with fatigue. We should be looking like ghosts ourselves,\\nand despair would be seizing on our hearts. We should be in continual\\nsquabbles with our guides and porters, and completely exposed to\\ntheir unbridled brutality. During the daytime, a damp, penetrating,\\nunendurable humidity! At night, a cold frequently intolerable, and\\nthe stings of a kind of fly whose bite pierces the thickest cloth, and\\ndrives the victim crazy! All this, too, without saying any thing about\\nwild beasts and ferocious native tribes!\"\\n\\n\"I move that we don\\'t try it!\" said Joe, in his droll way.\\n\\n\"I exaggerate nothing,\" continued Ferguson, \"for, upon reading the\\nnarratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture into\\nthese regions, your eyes would fill with tears.\"\\n\\nAbout eleven o\\'clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the\\ntribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the\\nVictoria with their weapons. Finally, she sped along as far as the last\\nundulations of the country which precede Rubeho. These form the last and\\nloftiest chain of the mountains of Usagara.\\n\\nThe aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic\\nconformation of the country. The three ramifications mentioned, of which\\nthe Duthumi forms the first link, are separated by immense longitudinal\\nplains. These elevated summits consist of rounded cones, between which\\nthe soil is bestrewn with erratic blocks of stone and gravelly bowlders.\\nThe most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the Zanzibar\\ncoast, but the western slopes are merely inclined planes. The\\ndepressions in the soil are covered with a black, rich loam, on which\\nthere is a vigorous vegetation. Various water-courses filter through,\\ntoward the east, and work their way onward to flow into the Kingani,\\nin the midst of gigantic clumps of sycamore, tamarind, calabash, and\\npalmyra trees.\\n\\n\"Attention!\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"We are approaching Rubeho, the name\\nof which signifies, in the language of the country, the \\'Passage of the\\nWinds,\\' and we would do well to double its jagged pinnacles at a certain\\nheight. If my chart be exact, we are going to ascend to an elevation of\\nfive thousand feet.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the\\natmosphere?\"\\n\\n\"Very seldom: the height of the African mountains appears to be quite\\nmoderate compared with that of the European and Asiatic ranges; but,\\nin any case, our good Victoria will find no difficulty in passing over\\nthem.\"\\n\\nIn a very little while, the gas expanded under the action of the heat,\\nand the balloon took a very decided ascensional movement. Besides, the\\ndilation of the hydrogen involved no danger, and only three-fourths of\\nthe vast capacity of the balloon was filled when the barometer, by a\\ndepression of eight inches, announced an elevation of six thousand feet.\\n\\n\"Shall we go this high very long?\" asked Joe.\\n\\n\"The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms,\" said\\nthe doctor; \"and, with a very large balloon, one might go far. That is\\nwhat Messrs. Brioschi and Gay-Lussac did; but then the blood burst from\\ntheir mouths and ears. Respirable air was wanting. Some years ago, two\\nfearless Frenchmen, Messrs. Barral and Bixio, also ventured into the\\nvery lofty regions; but their balloon burst--\"\\n\\n\"And they fell?\" asked Kennedy, abruptly.\\n\\n\"Certainly they did; but as learned men should always fall--namely,\\nwithout hurting themselves.\"\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Joe, \"you may try their fall over again, if you\\nlike; but, as for me, who am but a dolt, I prefer keeping at the medium\\nheight--neither too far up, nor too low down. It won\\'t do to be too\\nambitious.\"\\n\\nAt the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has\\nalready greatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the\\nvoice is not so easily heard. The view of objects becomes confused; the\\ngaze no longer takes in any but large, quite ill-distinguishable masses;\\nmen and animals on the surface become absolutely invisible; the roads\\nand rivers get to look like threads, and the lakes dwindle to ponds.\\n\\nThe doctor and his friends felt themselves in a very anomalous\\ncondition; an atmospheric current of extreme velocity was bearing them\\naway beyond arid mountains, upon whose summits vast fields of snow\\nsurprised the gaze; while their convulsed appearance told of Titanic\\ntravail in the earliest epoch of the world\\'s existence.\\n\\nThe sun shone at the zenith, and his rays fell perpendicularly upon\\nthose lonely summits. The doctor took an accurate design of these\\nmountains, which form four distinct ridges almost in a straight line,\\nthe northernmost being the longest.\\n\\nThe Victoria soon descended the slope opposite to the Rubeho, skirting\\nan acclivity covered with woods, and dotted with trees of very\\ndeep-green foliage. Then came crests and ravines, in a sort of desert\\nwhich preceded the Ugogo country; and lower down were yellow plains,\\nparched and fissured by the intense heat, and, here and there, bestrewn\\nwith saline plants and brambly thickets.\\n\\nSome underbrush, which, farther on, became forests, embellished the\\nhorizon. The doctor went nearer to the ground; the anchors were thrown\\nout, and one of them soon caught in the boughs of a huge sycamore.\\n\\nJoe, slipping nimbly down the tree, carefully attached the anchor, and\\nthe doctor left his cylinder at work to a certain degree in order to\\nretain sufficient ascensional force in the balloon to keep it in the\\nair. Meanwhile the wind had suddenly died away.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Ferguson, \"take two guns, friend Dick--one for yourself\\nand one for Joe--and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of\\nantelope-meat; they will make us a good dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Off to the hunt!\" exclaimed Kennedy, joyously.\\n\\nHe climbed briskly out of the car and descended. Joe had swung himself\\ndown from branch to branch, and was waiting for him below, stretching\\nhis limbs in the mean time.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t fly away without us, doctor!\" shouted Joe.\\n\\n\"Never fear, my boy!--I am securely lashed. I\\'ll spend the time getting\\nmy notes into shape. A good hunt to you! but be careful. Besides, from\\nmy post here, I can observe the face of the country, and, at the least\\nsuspicious thing I notice, I\\'ll fire a signal-shot, and with that you\\nmust rally home.\"\\n\\n\"Agreed!\" said Kennedy; and off they went.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEENTH.\\n\\nThe Forest of Gum-Trees.--The Blue Antelope.--The Rallying-Signal.--An\\nUnexpected Attack.--The Kanyeme.--A Night in the Open Air.--The\\nMabunguru.--Jihoue-la-Mkoa.--A Supply of Water.--Arrival at Kazeh.\\n\\nThe country, dry and parched as it was, consisting of a clayey soil that\\ncracked open with the heat, seemed, indeed, a desert: here and there\\nwere a few traces of caravans; the bones of men and animals, that had\\nbeen half-gnawed away, mouldering together in the same dust.\\n\\nAfter half an hour\\'s walking, Dick and Joe plunged into a forest of\\ngum-trees, their eyes alert on all sides, and their fingers on the\\ntrigger. There was no foreseeing what they might encounter. Without\\nbeing a rifleman, Joe could handle fire-arms with no trifling dexterity.\\n\\n\"A walk does one good, Mr. Kennedy, but this isn\\'t the easiest ground in\\nthe world,\" he said, kicking aside some fragments of quartz with which\\nthe soil was bestrewn.\\n\\nKennedy motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt. The present\\ncase compelled them to dispense with hunting-dogs, and, no matter what\\nJoe\\'s agility might be, he could not be expected to have the scent of a\\nsetter or a greyhound.\\n\\nA herd of a dozen antelopes were quenching their thirst in the bed of\\na torrent where some pools of water had lodged. The graceful creatures,\\nsnuffing danger in the breeze, seemed to be disturbed and uneasy. Their\\nbeautiful heads could be seen between every draught, raised in the air\\nwith quick and sudden motion as they sniffed the wind in the direction\\nof our two hunters, with their flexible nostrils.\\n\\nKennedy stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery, while Joe remained\\nmotionless where he was. The former, at length, got within gunshot and\\nfired.\\n\\nThe herd disappeared in the twinkling of an eye; one male antelope\\nonly, that was hit just behind the shoulder-joint, fell headlong to the\\nground, and Kennedy leaped toward his booty.\\n\\nIt was a blauwbok, a superb animal of a pale-bluish color shading upon\\nthe gray, but with the belly and the inside of the legs as white as the\\ndriven snow.\\n\\n\"A splendid shot!\" exclaimed the hunter. \"It\\'s a very rare species of\\nthe antelope, and I hope to be able to prepare his skin in such a way as\\nto keep it.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" said Joe, \"do you think of doing that, Mr. Kennedy?\"\\n\\n\"Why, certainly I do! Just see what a fine hide it is!\"\\n\\n\"But Dr. Ferguson will never allow us to take such an extra weight!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right, Joe. Still it is a pity to have to leave such a noble\\nanimal.\"\\n\\n\"The whole of it? Oh, we won\\'t do that, sir; we\\'ll take all the good\\neatable parts of it, and, if you\\'ll let me, I\\'ll cut him up just as well\\nas the chairman of the honorable corporation of butchers of the city of\\nLondon could do.\"\\n\\n\"As you please, my boy! But you know that in my hunter\\'s way I can just\\nas easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of that, Mr. Kennedy. Well, then, you can build a fireplace\\nwith a few stones; there\\'s plenty of dry dead-wood, and I can make the\\nhot coals tell in a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! that won\\'t take long,\" said Kennedy, going to work on the\\nfireplace, where he had a brisk flame crackling and sparkling in a\\nminute or two.\\n\\nJoe had cut some of the nicest steaks and the best parts of the\\ntenderloin from the carcass of the antelope, and these were quickly\\ntransformed to the most savory of broils.\\n\\n\"There, those will tickle the doctor!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Do you know what I was thinking about?\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Why, about the steaks you\\'re broiling, to be sure!\" replied Dick.\\n\\n\"Not the least in the world. I was thinking what a figure we\\'d cut if we\\ncouldn\\'t find the balloon again.\"\\n\\n\"By George, what an idea! Why, do you think the doctor would desert us?\"\\n\\n\"No; but suppose his anchor were to slip!\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! and, besides, the doctor would find no difficulty in coming\\ndown again with his balloon; he handles it at his ease.\"\\n\\n\"But suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn\\'t come\\nback toward us?\"\\n\\n\"Come, come, Joe! a truce to your suppositions; they\\'re any thing but\\npleasant.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir, every thing that happens in this world is natural, of course;\\nbut, then, any thing may happen, and we ought to look out beforehand.\"\\n\\nAt this moment the report of a gun rang out upon the air.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" exclaimed Joe.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my rifle, I know the ring of her!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"A signal!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; danger for us!\"\\n\\n\"For him, too, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s be off!\"\\n\\nAnd the hunters, having gathered up the product of their expedition,\\nrapidly made their way back along the path that they had marked by\\nbreaking boughs and bushes when they came. The density of the underbrush\\nprevented their seeing the balloon, although they could not be far from\\nit.\\n\\nA second shot was heard.\\n\\n\"We must hurry!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"There! a third report!\"\\n\\n\"Why, it sounds to me as if he was defending himself against something.\"\\n\\n\"Let us make haste!\"\\n\\nThey now began to run at the top of their speed. When they reached the\\noutskirts of the forest, they, at first glance, saw the balloon in its\\nplace and the doctor in the car.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" shouted Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Good God!\" suddenly exclaimed Joe.\\n\\n\"What do you see?\"\\n\\n\"Down there! look! a crowd of blacks surrounding the balloon!\"\\n\\nAnd, in fact, there, two miles from where they were, they saw some\\nthirty wild natives close together, yelling, gesticulating, and cutting\\nall kinds of antics at the foot of the sycamore. Some, climbing into the\\ntree itself, were making their way to the topmost branches. The danger\\nseemed pressing.\\n\\n\"My master is lost!\" cried Joe.\\n\\n\"Come! a little more coolness, Joe, and let us see how we stand. We hold\\nthe lives of four of those villains in our hands. Forward, then!\"\\n\\nThey had made a mile with headlong speed, when another report was heard\\nfrom the car. The shot had, evidently, told upon a huge black demon, who\\nhad been hoisting himself up by the anchor-rope. A lifeless body fell\\nfrom bough to bough, and hung about twenty feet from the ground, its\\narms and legs swaying to and fro in the air.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said Joe, halting, \"what does that fellow hold by?\"\\n\\n\"No matter what!\" said Kennedy; \"let us run! let us run!\"\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Kennedy,\" said Joe, again, in a roar of laughter, \"by his tail!\\nby his tail! it\\'s an ape! They\\'re all apes!\"\\n\\n\"Well, they\\'re worse than men!\" said Kennedy, as he dashed into the\\nmidst of the howling crowd.\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a troop of very formidable baboons of the dog-faced\\nspecies. These creatures are brutal, ferocious, and horrible to look\\nupon, with their dog-like muzzles and savage expression. However, a few\\nshots scattered them, and the chattering horde scampered off, leaving\\nseveral of their number on the ground.\\n\\nIn a moment Kennedy was on the ladder, and Joe, clambering up the\\nbranches, detached the anchor; the car then dipped to where he was, and\\nhe got into it without difficulty. A few minutes later, the Victoria\\nslowly ascended and soared away to the eastward, wafted by a moderate\\nwind.\\n\\n\"That was an attack for you!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"We thought you were surrounded by natives.\"\\n\\n\"Well, fortunately, they were only apes,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"At a distance there\\'s no great difference,\" remarked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Nor close at hand, either,\" added Joe.\\n\\n\"Well, however that may be,\" resumed Ferguson, \"this attack of apes\\nmight have had the most serious consequences. Had the anchor yielded to\\ntheir repeated efforts, who knows whither the wind would have carried\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"What did I tell you, Mr. Kennedy?\"\\n\\n\"You were right, Joe; but, even right as you may have been, you were,\\nat that moment, preparing some antelope-steaks, the very sight of which\\ngave me a monstrous appetite.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you!\" said the doctor; \"the flesh of the antelope is\\nexquisite.\"\\n\\n\"You may judge of that yourself, now, sir, for supper\\'s ready.\"\\n\\n\"Upon my word as a sportsman, those venison-steaks have a gamy flavor\\nthat\\'s not to be sneezed at, I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" said Joe, with his mouth full, \"I could live on antelope all\\nthe days of my life; and all the better with a glass of grog to wash it\\ndown.\"\\n\\nSo saying, the good fellow went to work to prepare a jorum of that\\nfragrant beverage, and all hands tasted it with satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Every thing has gone well thus far,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Very well indeed!\" assented Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Come, now, Mr. Kennedy, are you sorry that you came with us?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see anybody prevent my coming!\"\\n\\nIt was now four o\\'clock in the afternoon. The Victoria had struck a more\\nrapid current. The face of the country was gradually rising, and, ere\\nlong, the barometer indicated a height of fifteen hundred feet above the\\nlevel of the sea. The doctor was, therefore, obliged to keep his balloon\\nup by a quite considerable dilation of gas, and the cylinder was hard at\\nwork all the time.\\n\\nToward seven o\\'clock, the balloon was sailing over the basin of Kanyeme.\\nThe doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing, ten miles in\\nextent, with its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash\\ntrees. It is the residence of one of the sultans of the Ugogo country,\\nwhere civilization is, perhaps, the least backward. The natives there\\nare less addicted to selling members of their own families, but still,\\nmen and animals all live together in round huts, without frames, that\\nlook like haystacks.\\n\\nBeyond Kanyeme the soil becomes arid and stony, but in an hour\\'s\\njourney, in a fertile dip of the soil, vegetation had resumed all its\\nvigor at some distance from Mdaburu. The wind fell with the close of the\\nday, and the atmosphere seemed to sleep. The doctor vainly sought for a\\ncurrent of air at different heights, and, at last, seeing this calm\\nof all nature, he resolved to pass the night afloat, and, for greater\\nsafety, rose to the height of one thousand feet, where the balloon\\nremained motionless. The night was magnificent, the heavens glittering\\nwith stars, and profoundly silent in the upper air.\\n\\nDick and Joe stretched themselves on their peaceful couch, and were soon\\nsound asleep, the doctor keeping the first watch. At twelve o\\'clock the\\nlatter was relieved by Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Should the slightest accident happen, waken me,\" said Ferguson, \"and,\\nabove all things, don\\'t lose sight of the barometer. To us it is the\\ncompass!\"\\n\\nThe night was cold. There were twenty-seven degrees of difference\\nbetween its temperature and that of the daytime. With nightfall had\\nbegun the nocturnal concert of animals driven from their hiding-places\\nby hunger and thirst. The frogs struck in their guttural soprano,\\nredoubled by the yelping of the jackals, while the imposing bass of the\\nAfrican lion sustained the accords of this living orchestra.\\n\\nUpon resuming his post, in the morning, the doctor consulted his\\ncompass, and found that the wind had changed during the night. The\\nballoon had been bearing about thirty miles to the northwest during the\\nlast two hours. It was then passing over Mabunguru, a stony country,\\nstrewn with blocks of syenite of a fine polish, and knobbed with huge\\nbowlders and angular ridges of rock; conic masses, like the rocks of\\nKarnak, studded the soil like so many Druidic dolmens; the bones of\\nbuffaloes and elephants whitened it here and there; but few trees could\\nbe seen, excepting in the east, where there were dense woods, among\\nwhich a few villages lay half concealed.\\n\\nToward seven o\\'clock they saw a huge round rock nearly two miles in\\nextent, like an immense tortoise.\\n\\n\"We are on the right track,\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"There\\'s Jihoue-la-Mkoa,\\nwhere we must halt for a few minutes. I am going to renew the supply of\\nwater necessary for my cylinder, and so let us try to anchor somewhere.\"\\n\\n\"There are very few trees,\" replied the hunter.\\n\\n\"Never mind, let us try. Joe, throw out the anchors!\"\\n\\nThe balloon, gradually losing its ascensional force, approached the\\nground; the anchors ran along until, at last, one of them caught in the\\nfissure of a rock, and the balloon remained motionless.\\n\\nIt must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his\\ncylinder, during these halts. The equilibrium of the balloon had been\\ncalculated at the level of the sea; and, as the country was continually\\nascending, and had reached an elevation of from six to seven hundred\\nfeet, the balloon would have had a tendency to go lower than the surface\\nof the soil itself. It was, therefore, necessary to sustain it by a\\ncertain dilation of the gas. But, in case the doctor, in the absence\\nof all wind, had let the car rest upon the ground, the balloon, thus\\nrelieved of a considerable weight, would have kept up of itself, without\\nthe aid of the cylinder.\\n\\nThe maps indicated extensive ponds on the western slope of the\\nJihoue-la-Mkoa. Joe went thither alone with a cask that would hold about\\nten gallons. He found the place pointed out to him, without difficulty,\\nnear to a deserted village; got his stock of water, and returned in less\\nthan three-quarters of an hour. He had seen nothing particular excepting\\nsome immense elephant-pits. In fact, he came very near falling into one\\nof them, at the bottom of which lay a half-eaten carcass.\\n\\nHe brought back with him a sort of clover which the apes eat with\\navidity. The doctor recognized the fruit of the \"mbenbu\"-tree which\\ngrows in profusion, on the western part of Jihoue-la-Mkoa. Ferguson\\nwaited for Joe with a certain feeling of impatience, for even a short\\nhalt in this inhospitable region always inspires a degree of fear.\\n\\nThe water was got aboard without trouble, as the car was nearly resting\\non the ground. Joe then found it easy to loosen the anchor and leaped\\nlightly to his place beside the doctor. The latter then replenished the\\nflame in the cylinder, and the balloon majestically soared into the air.\\n\\nIt was then about one hundred miles from Kazeh, an important\\nestablishment in the interior of Africa, where, thanks to a\\nsouth-southeasterly current, the travellers might hope to arrive on that\\nsame day. They were moving at the rate of fourteen miles per hour, and\\nthe guidance of the balloon was becoming difficult, as they dared not\\nrise very high without extreme dilation of the gas, the country itself\\nbeing at an average height of three thousand feet. Hence, the doctor\\npreferred not to force the dilation, and so adroitly followed the\\nsinuosities of a pretty sharply-inclined plane, and swept very close\\nto the villages of Thembo and Tura-Wels. The latter forms part of\\nthe Unyamwezy, a magnificent country, where the trees attain enormous\\ndimensions; among them the cactus, which grows to gigantic size.\\n\\nAbout two o\\'clock, in magnificent weather, but under a fiery sun that\\ndevoured the least breath of air, the balloon was floating over the town\\nof Kazeh, situated about three hundred and fifty miles from the coast.\\n\\n\"We left Zanzibar at nine o\\'clock in the morning,\" said the doctor,\\nconsulting his notes, \"and, after two days\\' passage, we have, including\\nour deviations, travelled nearly five hundred geographical miles.\\nCaptains Burton and Speke took four months and a half to make the same\\ndistance!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEENTH.\\n\\nKazeh.--The Noisy Market-place.--The Appearance of the Balloon.--The\\nWangaga.--The Sons of the Moon.--The Doctor\\'s Walk.--The Population\\nof the Place.--The Royal Tembe.--The Sultan\\'s Wives.--A Royal\\nDrunken-Bout.--Joe an Object of Worship.--How they Dance in the Moon.--A\\nReaction.--Two Moons in one Sky.--The Instability of Divine Honors.\\n\\nKazeh, an important point in Central Africa, is not a city; in truth,\\nthere are no cities in the interior. Kazeh is but a collection of six\\nextensive excavations. There are enclosed a few houses and slave-huts,\\nwith little courtyards and small gardens, carefully cultivated with\\nonions, potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and mushrooms, of perfect flavor,\\ngrowing most luxuriantly.\\n\\nThe Unyamwezy is the country of the Moon--above all the rest, the\\nfertile and magnificent garden-spot of Africa. In its centre is the\\ndistrict of Unyanembe--a delicious region, where some families of Omani,\\nwho are of very pure Arabic origin, live in luxurious idleness.\\n\\nThey have, for a long period, held the commerce between the interior of\\nAfrica and Arabia: they trade in gums, ivory, fine muslin, and slaves.\\nTheir caravans traverse these equatorial regions on all sides; and they\\neven make their way to the coast in search of those articles of luxury\\nand enjoyment which the wealthy merchants covet; while the latter,\\nsurrounded by their wives and their attendants, lead in this charming\\ncountry the least disturbed and most horizontal of lives--always\\nstretched at full length, laughing, smoking, or sleeping.\\n\\nAround these excavations are numerous native dwellings; wide, open\\nspaces for the markets; fields of cannabis and datura; superb trees and\\ndepths of freshest shade--such is Kazeh!\\n\\nThere, too, is held the general rendezvous of the caravans--those of the\\nsouth, with their slaves and their freightage of ivory; and those of the\\nwest, which export cotton, glassware, and trinkets, to the tribes of the\\ngreat lakes.\\n\\nSo in the market-place there reigns perpetual excitement, a nameless\\nhubbub, made up of the cries of mixed-breed porters and carriers, the\\nbeating of drums, and the twanging of horns, the neighing of mules, the\\nbraying of donkeys, the singing of women, the squalling of children, and\\nthe banging of the huge rattan, wielded by the jemadar or leader of the\\ncaravans, who beats time to this pastoral symphony.\\n\\nThere, spread forth, without regard to order--indeed, we may say, in\\ncharming disorder--are the showy stuffs, the glass beads, the ivory\\ntusks, the rhinoceros\\'-teeth, the shark\\'s-teeth, the honey, the tobacco,\\nand the cotton of these regions, to be purchased at the strangest of\\nbargains by customers in whose eyes each article has a price only in\\nproportion to the desire it excites to possess it.\\n\\nAll at once this agitation, movement and noise stopped as though by\\nmagic. The balloon had just come in sight, far aloft in the sky, where\\nit hovered majestically for a few moments, and then descended slowly,\\nwithout deviating from its perpendicular. Men, women, children,\\nmerchants and slaves, Arabs and negroes, as suddenly disappeared within\\nthe \"tembes\" and the huts.\\n\\n\"My dear doctor,\" said Kennedy, \"if we continue to produce such a\\nsensation as this, we shall find some difficulty in establishing\\ncommercial relations with the people hereabouts.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s one kind of trade that we might carry on, though, easily\\nenough,\" said Joe; \"and that would be to go down there quietly, and walk\\noff with the best of the goods, without troubling our heads about the\\nmerchants; we\\'d get rich that way!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said the doctor, \"these natives are a little scared at first; but\\nthey won\\'t be long in coming back, either through suspicion or through\\ncuriosity.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really think so, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see pretty soon. But it wouldn\\'t be prudent to go too near\\nto them, for the balloon is not iron-clad, and is, therefore, not proof\\nagainst either an arrow or a bullet.\"\\n\\n\"Then you expect to hold a parley with these blacks?\"\\n\\n\"If we can do so safely, why should we not? There must be some Arab\\nmerchants here at Kazeh, who are better informed than the rest, and not\\nso barbarous. I remember that Burton and Speke had nothing but praises\\nto utter concerning the hospitality of these people; so we might, at\\nleast, make the venture.\"\\n\\nThe balloon having, meanwhile, gradually approached the ground, one of\\nthe anchors lodged in the top of a tree near the market-place.\\n\\nBy this time the whole population had emerged from their hiding-places\\nstealthily, thrusting their heads out first. Several \"waganga,\"\\nrecognizable by their badges of conical shellwork, came boldly forward.\\nThey were the sorcerers of the place. They bore in their girdles small\\ngourds, coated with tallow, and several other articles of witchcraft,\\nall of them, by-the-way, most professionally filthy.\\n\\nLittle by little the crowd gathered beside them, the women and children\\ngrouped around them, the drums renewed their deafening uproar, hands\\nwere violently clapped together, and then raised toward the sky.\\n\\n\"That\\'s their style of praying,\" said the doctor; \"and, if I\\'m not\\nmistaken, we\\'re going to be called upon to play a great part.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, play it!\"\\n\\n\"You, too, my good Joe--perhaps you\\'re to be a god!\"\\n\\n\"Well, master, that won\\'t trouble me much. I like a little flattery!\"\\n\\nAt this moment, one of the sorcerers, a \"myanga,\" made a sign, and all\\nthe clamor died away into the profoundest silence. He then addressed a\\nfew words to the strangers, but in an unknown tongue.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson, not having understood them, shouted some sentences in\\nArabic, at a venture, and was immediately answered in that language.\\n\\nThe speaker below then delivered himself of a very copious harangue,\\nwhich was also very flowery and very gravely listened to by his\\naudience. From it the doctor was not slow in learning that the balloon\\nwas mistaken for nothing less than the moon in person, and that the\\namiable goddess in question had condescended to approach the town with\\nher three sons--an honor that would never be forgotten in this land so\\ngreatly loved by the god of day.\\n\\nThe doctor responded, with much dignity, that the moon made her\\nprovincial tour every thousand years, feeling the necessity of showing\\nherself nearer at hand to her worshippers. He, therefore, begged them\\nnot to be disturbed by her presence, but to take advantage of it to make\\nknown all their wants and longings.\\n\\nThe sorcerer, in his turn, replied that the sultan, the \"mwani,\" who had\\nbeen sick for many years, implored the aid of heaven, and he invited the\\nson of the moon to visit him.\\n\\nThe doctor acquainted his companions with the invitation.\\n\\n\"And you are going to call upon this negro king?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly so; these people appear well disposed; the air is calm;\\nthere is not a breath of wind, and we have nothing to fear for the\\nballoon?\"\\n\\n\"But, what will you do?\"\\n\\n\"Be quiet on that score, my dear Dick. With a little medicine, I shall\\nwork my way through the affair!\"\\n\\nThen, addressing the crowd, he said:\\n\\n\"The moon, taking compassion on the sovereign who is so dear to the\\nchildren of Unyamwezy, has charged us to restore him to health. Let him\\nprepare to receive us!\"\\n\\nThe clamor, the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold,\\nand the whole immense ants\\' nest of black heads was again in motion.\\n\\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Dr. Ferguson, \"we must look out for every thing\\nbeforehand; we may be forced to leave this at any moment, unexpectedly,\\nand be off with extra speed. Dick had better remain, therefore, in the\\ncar, and keep the cylinder warm so as to secure a sufficient ascensional\\nforce for the balloon. The anchor is solidly fastened, and there is\\nnothing to fear in that respect. I shall descend, and Joe will go with\\nme, only that he must remain at the foot of the ladder.\"\\n\\n\"What! are you going alone into that blackamoor\\'s den?\"\\n\\n\"How! doctor, am I not to go with you?\"\\n\\n\"No! I shall go alone; these good folks imagine that the goddess of the\\nmoon has come to see them, and their superstition protects me; so have\\nno fear, and each one remain at the post that I have assigned to him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, since you wish it,\" sighed Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Look closely to the dilation of the gas.\"\\n\\n\"Agreed!\"\\n\\nBy this time the shouts of the natives had swelled to double volume as\\nthey vehemently implored the aid of the heavenly powers.\\n\\n\"There, there,\" said Joe, \"they\\'re rather rough in their orders to their\\ngood moon and her divine sons.\"\\n\\nThe doctor, equipped with his travelling medicine-chest, descended to\\nthe ground, preceded by Joe, who kept a straight countenance and looked\\nas grave and knowing as the circumstances of the case required. He then\\nseated himself at the foot of the ladder in the Arab fashion, with his\\nlegs crossed under him, and a portion of the crowd collected around him\\nin a circle, at respectful distances.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the doctor, escorted to the sound of savage\\ninstruments, and with wild religious dances, slowly proceeded toward the\\nroyal \"tembe,\" situated a considerable distance outside of the town. It\\nwas about three o\\'clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly. In fact,\\nwhat less could it do upon so grand an occasion!\\n\\nThe doctor stepped along with great dignity, the waganga surrounding him\\nand keeping off the crowd. He was soon joined by the natural son of the\\nsultan, a handsomely-built young fellow, who, according to the custom of\\nthe country, was the sole heir of the paternal goods, to the exclusion\\nof the old man\\'s legitimate children. He prostrated himself before the\\nson of the moon, but the latter graciously raised him to his feet.\\n\\nThree-quarters of an hour later, through shady paths, surrounded by\\nall the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, this enthusiastic procession\\narrived at the sultan\\'s palace, a sort of square edifice called\\nititenya, and situated on the slope of a hill.\\n\\nA kind of veranda, formed by the thatched roof, adorned the outside,\\nsupported upon wooden pillars, which had some pretensions to being\\ncarved. Long lines of dark-red clay decorated the walls in characters\\nthat strove to reproduce the forms of men and serpents, the latter\\nbetter imitated, of course, than the former. The roofing of this abode\\ndid not rest directly upon the walls, and the air could, therefore,\\ncirculate freely, but windows there were none, and the door hardly\\ndeserved the name.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson was received with all the honors by the guards and\\nfavorites of the sultan; these were men of a fine race, the Wanyamwezi\\nso-called, a pure type of the central African populations, strong,\\nrobust, well-made, and in splendid condition. Their hair, divided into\\na great number of small tresses, fell over their shoulders, and by means\\nof black-and-blue incisions they had tattooed their cheeks from the\\ntemples to the mouth. Their ears, frightfully distended, held dangling\\nto them disks of wood and plates of gum copal. They were clad in\\nbrilliantly-painted cloths, and the soldiers were armed with the\\nsaw-toothed war-club, the bow and arrows barbed and poisoned with the\\njuice of the euphorbium, the cutlass, the \"sima,\" a long sabre (also\\nwith saw-like teeth), and some small battle-axes.\\n\\nThe doctor advanced into the palace, and there, notwithstanding the\\nsultan\\'s illness, the din, which was terrific before, redoubled the\\ninstant that he arrived. He noticed, at the lintels of the door,\\nsome rabbits\\' tails and zebras\\' manes, suspended as talismans. He was\\nreceived by the whole troop of his majesty\\'s wives, to the harmonious\\naccords of the \"upatu,\" a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a copper\\nkettle, and to the uproar of the \"kilindo,\" a drum five feet high,\\nhollowed out from the trunk of a tree, and hammered by the ponderous,\\nhorny fists of two jet-black virtuosi.\\n\\nMost of the women were rather good-looking, and they laughed and\\nchattered merrily as they smoked their tobacco and \"thang\" in huge black\\npipes. They seemed to be well made, too, under the long robes that they\\nwore gracefully flung about their persons, and carried a sort of \"kilt\"\\nwoven from the fibres of calabash fastened around their girdles.\\n\\nSix of them were not the least merry of the party, although put aside\\nfrom the rest, and reserved for a cruel fate. On the death of the\\nsultan, they were to be buried alive with him, so as to occupy and\\ndivert his mind during the period of eternal solitude.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson, taking in the whole scene at a rapid glance, approached\\nthe wooden couch on which the sultan lay reclining. There he saw a man\\nof about forty, completely brutalized by orgies of every description,\\nand in a condition that left little or nothing to be done. The\\nsickness that had afflicted him for so many years was simply perpetual\\ndrunkenness. The royal sot had nearly lost all consciousness, and all\\nthe ammonia in the world would not have set him on his feet again.\\n\\nHis favorites and the women kept on bended knees during this solemn\\nvisit. By means of a few drops of powerful cordial, the doctor for a\\nmoment reanimated the imbruted carcass that lay before him. The sultan\\nstirred, and, for a dead body that had given no sign whatever of\\nlife for several hours previously, this symptom was received with a\\ntremendous repetition of shouts and cries in the doctor\\'s honor.\\n\\nThe latter, who had seen enough of it by this time, by a rapid motion\\nput aside his too demonstrative admirers and went out of the palace,\\ndirecting his steps immediately toward the balloon, for it was now six\\no\\'clock in the evening.\\n\\nJoe, during his absence, had been quietly waiting at the foot of the\\nladder, where the crowd paid him their most humble respects. Like a\\ngenuine son of the moon, he let them keep on. For a divinity, he had\\nthe air of a very clever sort of fellow, by no means proud, nay, even\\npleasingly familiar with the young negresses, who seemed never to tire\\nof looking at him. Besides, he went so far as to chat agreeably with\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Worship me, ladies! worship me!\" he said to them. \"I\\'m a clever sort of\\ndevil, if I am the son of a goddess.\"\\n\\nThey brought him propitiatory gifts, such as are usually deposited in\\nthe fetich huts or mzimu. These gifts consisted of stalks of barley and\\nof \"pombe.\" Joe considered himself in duty bound to taste the latter\\nspecies of strong beer, but his palate, although accustomed to gin and\\nwhiskey, could not withstand the strength of the new beverage, and he\\nhad to make a horrible grimace, which his dusky friends took to be a\\nbenevolent smile.\\n\\nThereupon, the young damsels, conjoining their voices in a drawling\\nchant, began to dance around him with the utmost gravity.\\n\\n\"Ah! you\\'re dancing, are you?\" said he. \"Well, I won\\'t be behind you in\\npoliteness, and so I\\'ll give you one of my country reels.\"\\n\\nSo at it he went, in one of the wildest jigs that ever was seen,\\ntwisting, turning, and jerking himself in all directions; dancing with\\nhis hands, dancing with his body, dancing with his knees, dancing\\nwith his feet; describing the most fearful contortions and extravagant\\nevolutions; throwing himself into incredible attitudes; grimacing beyond\\nall belief, and, in fine giving his savage admirers a strange idea of\\nthe style of ballet adopted by the deities in the moon.\\n\\nThen, the whole collection of blacks, naturally as imitative as monkeys,\\nat once reproduced all his airs and graces, his leaps and shakes and\\ncontortions; they did not lose a single gesticulation; they did not\\nforget an attitude; and the result was, such a pandemonium of movement,\\nnoise, and excitement, as it would be out of the question even feebly\\nto describe. But, in the very midst of the fun, Joe saw the doctor\\napproaching.\\n\\nThe latter was coming at full speed, surrounded by a yelling and\\ndisorderly throng. The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited.\\nThey were close upon the doctor\\'s heels, crowding and threatening him.\\n\\nSingular reaction! What had happened? Had the sultan unluckily perished\\nin the hands of his celestial physician?\\n\\nKennedy, from his post of observation, saw the danger without knowing\\nwhat had caused it, and the balloon, powerfully urged by the dilation\\nof the gas, strained and tugged at the ropes that held it as though\\nimpatient to soar away.\\n\\nThe doctor had got as far as the foot of the ladder. A superstitious\\nfear still held the crowd aloof and hindered them from committing any\\nviolence on his person. He rapidly scaled the ladder, and Joe followed\\nhim with his usual agility.\\n\\n\"Not a moment to lose!\" said the doctor. \"Don\\'t attempt to let go the\\nanchor! We\\'ll cut the cord! Follow me!\"\\n\\n\"But what\\'s the matter?\" asked Joe, clambering into the car.\\n\\n\"What\\'s happened?\" questioned Kennedy, rifle in hand.\\n\\n\"Look!\" replied the doctor, pointing to the horizon.\\n\\n\"Well?\" ejaculated the Scot.\\n\\n\"Well! the moon!\"\\n\\nAnd, in fact, there was the moon rising red and magnificent, a globe of\\nfire in a field of blue! It was she, indeed--she and the balloon!--both\\nin one sky!\\n\\nEither there were two moons, then, or these strangers were imposters,\\ndesigning scamps, false deities!\\n\\nSuch were the very natural reflections of the crowd, and hence the\\nreaction in their feelings.\\n\\nJoe could not, for the life of him, keep in a roar of laughter; and the\\npopulation of Kazeh, comprehending that their prey was slipping through\\ntheir clutches, set up prolonged howlings, aiming, the while, their bows\\nand muskets at the balloon.\\n\\nBut one of the sorcerers made a sign, and all the weapons were lowered.\\nHe then began to climb into the tree, intending to seize the rope and\\nbring the machine to the ground.\\n\\nJoe leaned out with a hatchet ready. \"Shall I cut away?\" said he.\\n\\n\"No; wait a moment,\" replied the doctor.\\n\\n\"But this black?\"\\n\\n\"We may, perhaps, save our anchor--and I hold a great deal by that.\\nThere\\'ll always be time enough to cut loose.\"\\n\\nThe sorcerer, having climbed to the right place, worked so vigorously\\nthat he succeeded in detaching the anchor, and the latter, violently\\njerked, at that moment, by the start of the balloon, caught the rascal\\nbetween the limbs, and carried him off astride of it through the air.\\n\\nThe stupefaction of the crowd was indescribable as they saw one of their\\nwaganga thus whirled away into space.\\n\\n\"Huzza!\" roared Joe, as the balloon--thanks to its ascensional\\nforce--shot up higher into the sky, with increased rapidity.\\n\\n\"He holds on well,\" said Kennedy; \"a little trip will do him good.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we let this darky drop all at once?\" inquired Joe.\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" replied the doctor, \"we\\'ll let him down easily; and I warrant\\nme that, after such an adventure, the power of the wizard will be\\nenormously enhanced in the sight of his comrades.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I wouldn\\'t put it past them to make a god of him!\" said Joe, with\\na laugh.\\n\\nThe Victoria, by this time, had risen to the height of one thousand\\nfeet, and the black hung to the rope with desperate energy. He had\\nbecome completely silent, and his eyes were fixed, for his terror was\\nblended with amazement. A light west wind was sweeping the balloon right\\nover the town, and far beyond it.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, the doctor, seeing the country deserted, moderated\\nthe flame of his cylinder, and descended toward the ground. At twenty\\nfeet above the turf, the affrighted sorcerer made up his mind in a\\ntwinkling: he let himself drop, fell on his feet, and scampered off at\\na furious pace toward Kazeh; while the balloon, suddenly relieved of his\\nweight, again shot up on her course.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEENTH.\\n\\nSymptoms of a Storm.--The Country of the Moon.--The Future of the\\nAfrican Continent.--The Last Machine of all.--A View of the Country at\\nSunset.--Flora and Fauna.--The Tempest.--The Zone of Fire.--The Starry\\nHeavens.\\n\\n\"See,\" said Joe, \"what comes of playing the sons of the moon without her\\nleave! She came near serving us an ugly trick. But say, master, did you\\ndamage your credit as a physician?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" chimed in the sportsman. \"What kind of a dignitary was\\nthis Sultan of Kazeh?\"\\n\\n\"An old half-dead sot,\" replied the doctor, \"whose loss will not be very\\nseverely felt. But the moral of all this is that honors are fleeting,\\nand we must not take too great a fancy to them.\"\\n\\n\"So much the worse!\" rejoined Joe. \"I liked the thing--to be\\nworshipped!--Play the god as you like! Why, what would any one ask more\\nthan that? By-the-way, the moon did come up, too, and all red, as if she\\nwas in a rage.\"\\n\\nWhile the three friends went on chatting of this and other things, and\\nJoe examined the luminary of night from an entirely novel point of view,\\nthe heavens became covered with heavy clouds to the northward, and the\\nlowering masses assumed a most sinister and threatening look. Quite a\\nsmart breeze, found about three hundred feet from the earth, drove the\\nballoon toward the north-northeast; and above it the blue vault was\\nclear; but the atmosphere felt close and dull.\\n\\nThe aeronauts found themselves, at about eight in the evening, in\\nthirty-two degrees forty minutes east longitude, and four degrees\\nseventeen minutes latitude. The atmospheric currents, under the\\ninfluence of a tempest not far off, were driving them at the rate of\\nfrom thirty to thirty-five miles an hour; the undulating and fertile\\nplains of Mfuto were passing swiftly beneath them. The spectacle was one\\nworthy of admiration--and admire it they did.\\n\\n\"We are now right in the country of the Moon,\" said Dr. Ferguson; \"for\\nit has retained the name that antiquity gave it, undoubtedly, because\\nthe moon has been worshipped there in all ages. It is, really, a superb\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\"It would be hard to find more splendid vegetation.\"\\n\\n\"If we found the like of it around London it would not be natural, but\\nit would be very pleasant,\" put in Joe. \"Why is it that such savage\\ncountries get all these fine things?\"\\n\\n\"And who knows,\" said the doctor, \"that this country may not, one day,\\nbecome the centre of civilization? The races of the future may repair\\nhither, when Europe shall have become exhausted in the effort to feed\\nher inhabitants.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so, really?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, my dear Dick. Just note the progress of events: consider\\nthe migrations of races, and you will arrive at the same conclusion\\nassuredly. Asia was the first nurse of the world, was she not? For about\\nfour thousand years she travailed, she grew pregnant, she produced, and\\nthen, when stones began to cover the soil where the golden harvests sung\\nby Homer had flourished, her children abandoned her exhausted and\\nbarren bosom. You next see them precipitating themselves upon young\\nand vigorous Europe, which has nourished them for the last two thousand\\nyears. But already her fertility is beginning to die out; her productive\\npowers are diminishing every day. Those new diseases that annually\\nattack the products of the soil, those defective crops, those\\ninsufficient resources, are all signs of a vitality that is rapidly\\nwearing out and of an approaching exhaustion. Thus, we already see the\\nmillions rushing to the luxuriant bosom of America, as a source of help,\\nnot inexhaustible indeed, but not yet exhausted. In its turn, that new\\ncontinent will grow old; its virgin forests will fall before the axe\\nof industry, and its soil will become weak through having too fully\\nproduced what had been demanded of it. Where two harvests bloomed every\\nyear, hardly one will be gathered from a soil completely drained of its\\nstrength. Then, Africa will be there to offer to new races the treasures\\nthat for centuries have been accumulating in her breast. Those climates\\nnow so fatal to strangers will be purified by cultivation and by\\ndrainage of the soil, and those scattered water supplies will be\\ngathered into one common bed to form an artery of navigation. Then this\\ncountry over which we are now passing, more fertile, richer, and fuller\\nof vitality than the rest, will become some grand realm where more\\nastonishing discoveries than steam and electricity will be brought to\\nlight.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! sir,\" said Joe, \"I\\'d like to see all that.\"\\n\\n\"You got up too early in the morning, my boy!\"\\n\\n\"Besides,\" said Kennedy, \"that may prove to be a very dull period when\\nindustry will swallow up every thing for its own profit. By dint of\\ninventing machinery, men will end in being eaten up by it! I have always\\nfancied that the end of the earth will be when some enormous boiler,\\nheated to three thousand millions of atmospheric pressure, shall explode\\nand blow up our Globe!\"\\n\\n\"And I add that the Americans,\" said Joe, \"will not have been the last\\nto work at the machine!\"\\n\\n\"In fact,\" assented the doctor, \"they are great boiler-makers! But,\\nwithout allowing ourselves to be carried away by such speculations, let\\nus rest content with enjoying the beauties of this country of the Moon,\\nsince we have been permitted to see it.\"\\n\\nThe sun, darting his last rays beneath the masses of heaped-up cloud,\\nadorned with a crest of gold the slightest inequalities of the\\nground below; gigantic trees, arborescent bushes, mosses on the even\\nsurface--all had their share of this luminous effulgence. The soil,\\nslightly undulating, here and there rose into little conical hills;\\nthere were no mountains visible on the horizon; immense brambly\\npalisades, impenetrable hedges of thorny jungle, separated the clearings\\ndotted with numerous villages, and immense euphorbiae surrounded\\nthem with natural fortifications, interlacing their trunks with the\\ncoral-shaped branches of the shrubbery and undergrowth.\\n\\nEre long, the Malagazeri, the chief tributary of Lake Tanganayika, was\\nseen winding between heavy thickets of verdure, offering an asylum to\\nmany water-courses that spring from the torrents formed in the season\\nof freshets, or from ponds hollowed in the clayey soil. To observers\\nlooking from a height, it was a chain of waterfalls thrown across the\\nwhole western face of the country.\\n\\nAnimals with huge humps were feeding in the luxuriant prairies, and were\\nhalf hidden, sometimes, in the tall grass; spreading forests in bloom\\nredolent of spicy perfumes presented themselves to the gaze like immense\\nbouquets; but, in these bouquets, lions, leopards, hyenas, and tigers,\\nwere then crouching for shelter from the last hot rays of the\\nsetting sun. From time to time, an elephant made the tall tops of the\\nundergrowth sway to and fro, and you could hear the crackling of huge\\nbranches as his ponderous ivory tusks broke them in his way.\\n\\n\"What a sporting country!\" exclaimed Dick, unable longer to restrain his\\nenthusiasm; \"why, a single ball fired at random into those forests would\\nbring down game worthy of it. Suppose we try it once!\"\\n\\n\"No, my dear Dick; the night is close at hand--a threatening night with\\na tempest in the background--and the storms are awful in this country,\\nwhere the heated soil is like one vast electric battery.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Joe, \"the heat has got to be enough to\\nchoke one, and the breeze has died away. One can feel that something\\'s\\ncoming.\"\\n\\n\"The atmosphere is saturated with electricity,\" replied the doctor;\\n\"every living creature is sensible that this state of the air portends a\\nstruggle of the elements, and I confess that I never before was so full\\nof the fluid myself.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,\" suggested Dick, \"would it not be advisable to alight?\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary, Dick, I\\'d rather go up, only that I am afraid of being\\ncarried out of my course by these counter-currents contending in the\\natmosphere.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any idea, then, of abandoning the route that we have followed\\nsince we left the coast?\"\\n\\n\"If I can manage to do so,\" replied the doctor, \"I will turn more\\ndirectly northward, by from seven to eight degrees; I shall then\\nendeavor to ascend toward the presumed latitudes of the sources of the\\nNile; perhaps we may discover some traces of Captain Speke\\'s expedition\\nor of M. de Heuglin\\'s caravan. Unless I am mistaken, we are at\\nthirty-two degrees forty minutes east longitude, and I should like to\\nascend directly north of the equator.\"\\n\\n\"Look there!\" exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly, \"see those hippopotami\\nsliding out of the pools--those masses of blood-colored flesh--and those\\ncrocodiles snuffing the air aloud!\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re choking!\" ejaculated Joe. \"Ah! what a fine way to travel this\\nis; and how one can snap his fingers at all that vermin!--Doctor! Mr.\\nKennedy! see those packs of wild animals hurrying along close together.\\nThere are fully two hundred. Those are wolves.\"\\n\\n\"No! Joe, not wolves, but wild dogs; a famous breed that does not\\nhesitate to attack the lion himself. They are the worst customers a\\ntraveller could meet, for they would instantly tear him to pieces.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it isn\\'t Joe that\\'ll undertake to muzzle them!\" responded that\\namiable youth. \"After all, though, if that\\'s the nature of the beast, we\\nmustn\\'t be too hard on them for it!\"\\n\\nSilence gradually settled down under the influence of the impending\\nstorm: the thickened air actually seemed no longer adapted to the\\ntransmission of sound; the atmosphere appeared MUFFLED, and, like a\\nroom hung with tapestry, lost all its sonorous reverberation. The\\n\"rover bird\" so-called, the coroneted crane, the red and blue jays,\\nthe mocking-bird, the flycatcher, disappeared among the foliage of the\\nimmense trees, and all nature revealed symptoms of some approaching\\ncatastrophe.\\n\\nAt nine o\\'clock the Victoria hung motionless over Msene, an extensive\\ngroup of villages scarcely distinguishable in the gloom. Once in a\\nwhile, the reflection of a wandering ray of light in the dull water\\ndisclosed a succession of ditches regularly arranged, and, by one last\\ngleam, the eye could make out the calm and sombre forms of palm-trees,\\nsycamores, and gigantic euphorbiae.\\n\\n\"I am stifling!\" said the Scot, inhaling, with all the power of his\\nlungs, as much as possible of the rarefied air. \"We are not moving an\\ninch! Let us descend!\"\\n\\n\"But the tempest!\" said the doctor, with much uneasiness.\\n\\n\"If you are afraid of being carried away by the wind, it seems to me\\nthat there is no other course to pursue.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the storm won\\'t burst to-night,\" said Joe; \"the clouds are very\\nhigh.\"\\n\\n\"That is just the thing that makes me hesitate about going beyond them;\\nwe should have to rise still higher, lose sight of the earth, and\\nnot know all night whether we were moving forward or not, or in what\\ndirection we were going.\"\\n\\n\"Make up your mind, dear doctor, for time presses!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity that the wind has fallen,\" said Joe, again; \"it would have\\ncarried us clear of the storm.\"\\n\\n\"It is, indeed, a pity, my friends,\" rejoined the doctor. \"The clouds\\nare dangerous for us; they contain opposing currents which might catch\\nus in their eddies, and lightnings that might set on fire. Again, those\\nperils avoided, the force of the tempest might hurl us to the ground,\\nwere we to cast our anchor in the tree-tops.\"\\n\\n\"Then what shall we do?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must try to get the balloon into a medium zone of the\\natmosphere, and there keep her suspended between the perils of the\\nheavens and those of the earth. We have enough water for the cylinder,\\nand our two hundred pounds of ballast are untouched. In case of\\nemergency I can use them.\"\\n\\n\"We will keep watch with you,\" said the hunter.\\n\\n\"No, my friends, put the provisions under shelter, and lie down; I will\\nrouse you, if it becomes necessary.\"\\n\\n\"But, master, wouldn\\'t you do well to take some rest yourself, as\\nthere\\'s no danger close on us just now?\" insisted poor Joe.\\n\\n\"No, thank you, my good fellow, I prefer to keep awake. We are not\\nmoving, and should circumstances not change, we\\'ll find ourselves\\nto-morrow in exactly the same place.\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, then, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, if you can only find it so!\"\\n\\nKennedy and Joe stretched themselves out under their blankets, and the\\ndoctor remained alone in the immensity of space.\\n\\nHowever, the huge dome of clouds visibly descended, and the darkness\\nbecame profound. The black vault closed in upon the earth as if to crush\\nit in its embrace.\\n\\nAll at once a violent, rapid, incisive flash of lightning pierced the\\ngloom, and the rent it made had not closed ere a frightful clap of\\nthunder shook the celestial depths.\\n\\n\"Up! up! turn out!\" shouted Ferguson.\\n\\nThe two sleepers, aroused by the terrible concussion, were at the\\ndoctor\\'s orders in a moment.\\n\\n\"Shall we descend?\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"No! the balloon could not stand it. Let us go up before those clouds\\ndissolve in water, and the wind is let loose!\" and, so saying, the\\ndoctor actively stirred up the flame of the cylinder, and turned it on\\nthe spirals of the serpentine siphon.\\n\\nThe tempests of the tropics develop with a rapidity equalled only by\\ntheir violence. A second flash of lightning rent the darkness, and was\\nfollowed by a score of others in quick succession. The sky was crossed\\nand dotted, like the zebra\\'s hide, with electric sparks, which danced\\nand flickered beneath the great drops of rain.\\n\\n\"We have delayed too long,\" exclaimed the doctor; \"we must now\\npass through a zone of fire, with our balloon filled as it is with\\ninflammable gas!\"\\n\\n\"But let us descend, then! let us descend!\" urged Kennedy.\\n\\n\"The risk of being struck would be just about even, and we should soon\\nbe torn to pieces by the branches of the trees!\"\\n\\n\"We are going up, doctor!\"\\n\\n\"Quicker, quicker still!\"\\n\\nIn this part of Africa, during the equatorial storms, it is not rare to\\ncount from thirty to thirty-five flashes of lightning per minute. The\\nsky is literally on fire, and the crashes of thunder are continuous.\\n\\nThe wind burst forth with frightful violence in this burning atmosphere;\\nit twisted the blazing clouds; one might have compared it to the breath\\nof some gigantic bellows, fanning all this conflagration.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson kept his cylinder at full heat, and the balloon dilated and\\nwent up, while Kennedy, on his knees, held together the curtains of\\nthe awning. The balloon whirled round wildly enough to make their heads\\nturn, and the aeronauts got some very alarming jolts, indeed, as their\\nmachine swung and swayed in all directions. Huge cavities would form in\\nthe silk of the balloon as the wind fiercely bent it in, and the stuff\\nfairly cracked like a pistol as it flew back from the pressure. A\\nsort of hail, preceded by a rumbling noise, hissed through the air and\\nrattled on the covering of the Victoria. The latter, however, continued\\nto ascend, while the lightning described tangents to the convexity of\\nher circumference; but she bore on, right through the midst of the fire.\\n\\n\"God protect us!\" said Dr. Ferguson, solemnly, \"we are in His hands;\\nHe alone can save us--but let us be ready for every event, even for\\nfire--our fall could not be very rapid.\"\\n\\nThe doctor\\'s voice could scarcely be heard by his companions; but they\\ncould see his countenance calm as ever even amid the flashing of the\\nlightnings; he was watching the phenomena of phosphorescence produced\\nby the fires of St. Elmo, that were now skipping to and fro along the\\nnetwork of the balloon.\\n\\nThe latter whirled and swung, but steadily ascended, and, ere the hour\\nwas over, it had passed the stormy belt. The electric display was going\\non below it like a vast crown of artificial fireworks suspended from the\\ncar.\\n\\nThen they enjoyed one of the grandest spectacles that Nature can offer\\nto the gaze of man. Below them, the tempest; above them, the starry\\nfirmament, tranquil, mute, impassible, with the moon projecting her\\npeaceful rays over these angry clouds.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson consulted the barometer; it announced twelve thousand feet\\nof elevation. It was then eleven o\\'clock at night.\\n\\n\"Thank Heaven, all danger is past; all we have to do now, is, to keep\\nourselves at this height,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"It was frightful!\" remarked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Joe, \"it gives a little variety to the trip, and I\\'m not\\nsorry to have seen a storm from a trifling distance up in the air. It\\'s\\na fine sight!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.\\n\\nThe Mountains of the Moon.--An Ocean of Verdure.--They cast Anchor.--The\\nTowing Elephant.--A Running Fire.--Death of the Monster.--The\\nField-Oven.--A Meal on the Grass.--A Night on the Ground.\\n\\nAbout four in the morning, Monday, the sun reappeared in the horizon;\\nthe clouds had dispersed, and a cheery breeze refreshed the morning\\ndawn.\\n\\nThe earth, all redolent with fragrant exhalations, reappeared to the\\ngaze of our travellers. The balloon, whirled about by opposing currents,\\nhad hardly budged from its place, and the doctor, letting the gas\\ncontract, descended so as to get a more northerly direction. For a long\\nwhile his quest was fruitless; the wind carried him toward the west\\nuntil he came in sight of the famous Mountains of the Moon, which\\ngrouped themselves in a semicircle around the extremity of Lake\\nTanganayika; their ridges, but slightly indented, stood out against\\nthe bluish horizon, so that they might have been mistaken for a natural\\nfortification, not to be passed by the explorers of the centre of\\nAfrica. Among them were a few isolated cones, revealing the mark of the\\neternal snows.\\n\\n\"Here we are at last,\" said the doctor, \"in an unexplored country!\\nCaptain Burton pushed very far to the westward, but he could not reach\\nthose celebrated mountains; he even denied their existence, strongly\\nas it was affirmed by Speke, his companion. He pretended that they were\\nborn in the latter\\'s fancy; but for us, my friends, there is no further\\ndoubt possible.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we cross them?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Not, if it please God. I am looking for a wind that will take me back\\ntoward the equator. I will even wait for one, if necessary, and will\\nmake the balloon like a ship that casts anchor, until favorable breezes\\ncome up.\"\\n\\nBut the foresight of the doctor was not long in bringing its reward;\\nfor, after having tried different heights, the Victoria at length began\\nto sail off to the northeastward with medium speed.\\n\\n\"We are in the right track,\" said the doctor, consulting his compass,\\n\"and scarcely two hundred feet from the surface; lucky circumstances\\nfor us, enabling us, as they do, to reconnoitre these new regions. When\\nCaptain Speke set out to discover Lake Ukereoue, he ascended more to the\\neastward in a straight line above Kazeh.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we keep on long in this way?\" inquired the Scot.\\n\\n\"Perhaps. Our object is to push a point in the direction of the sources\\nof the Nile; and we have more than six hundred miles to make before\\nwe get to the extreme limit reached by the explorers who came from the\\nnorth.\"\\n\\n\"And we shan\\'t set foot on the solid ground?\" murmured Joe; \"it\\'s enough\\nto cramp a fellow\\'s legs!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, indeed, my good Joe,\" said the doctor, reassuring him; \"we\\nhave to economize our provisions, you know; and on the way, Dick, you\\nmust get us some fresh meat.\"\\n\\n\"Whenever you like, doctor.\"\\n\\n\"We shall also have to replenish our stock of water. Who knows but we\\nmay be carried to some of the dried-up regions? So we cannot take too\\nmany precautions.\"\\n\\nAt noon the Victoria was at twenty-nine degrees fifteen minutes east\\nlongitude, and three degrees fifteen minutes south latitude. She passed\\nthe village of Uyofu, the last northern limit of the Unyamwezi, opposite\\nto the Lake Ukereoue, which could still be seen.\\n\\nThe tribes living near to the equator seem to be a little more\\ncivilized, and are governed by absolute monarchs, whose control is an\\nunlimited despotism. Their most compact union of power constitutes the\\nprovince of Karagwah.\\n\\nIt was decided by the aeronauts that they would alight at the first\\nfavorable place. They found that they should have to make a prolonged\\nhalt, and take a careful inspection of the balloon: so the flame of the\\ncylinder was moderated, and the anchors, flung out from the car, ere\\nlong began to sweep the grass of an immense prairie, that, from a\\ncertain height, looked like a shaven lawn, but the growth of which, in\\nreality, was from seven to eight feet in height.\\n\\nThe balloon skimmed this tall grass without bending it, like a gigantic\\nbutterfly: not an obstacle was in sight; it was an ocean of verdure\\nwithout a single breaker.\\n\\n\"We might proceed a long time in this style,\" remarked Kennedy; \"I don\\'t\\nsee one tree that we could approach, and I\\'m afraid that our hunt\\'s\\nover.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, Dick; you could not hunt anyhow in this grass, that grows higher\\nthan your head. We\\'ll find a favorable place presently.\"\\n\\nIn truth, it was a charming excursion that they were making now--a\\nveritable navigation on this green, almost transparent sea, gently\\nundulating in the breath of the wind. The little car seemed to cleave\\nthe waves of verdure, and, from time to time, coveys of birds of\\nmagnificent plumage would rise fluttering from the tall herbage, and\\nspeed away with joyous cries. The anchors plunged into this lake of\\nflowers, and traced a furrow that closed behind them, like the wake of a\\nship.\\n\\nAll at once a sharp shock was felt--the anchor had caught in the fissure\\nof some rock hidden in the high grass.\\n\\n\"We are fast!\" exclaimed Joe.\\n\\nThese words had scarcely been uttered when a shrill cry rang through the\\nair, and the following phrases, mingled with exclamations, escaped from\\nthe lips of our travellers:\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"A strange cry!\"\\n\\n\"Look! Why, we\\'re moving!\"\\n\\n\"The anchor has slipped!\"\\n\\n\"No; it holds, and holds fast too!\" said Joe, who was tugging at the\\nrope.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the rock, then, that\\'s moving!\"\\n\\nAn immense rustling was noticed in the grass, and soon an elongated,\\nwinding shape was seen rising above it.\\n\\n\"A serpent!\" shouted Joe.\\n\\n\"A serpent!\" repeated Kennedy, handling his rifle.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the doctor, \"it\\'s an elephant\\'s trunk!\"\\n\\n\"An elephant, Samuel?\"\\n\\nAnd, as Kennedy said this, he drew his rifle to his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Wait, Dick; wait!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a fact! The animal\\'s towing us!\"\\n\\n\"And in the right direction, Joe--in the right direction.\"\\n\\nThe elephant was now making some headway, and soon reached a clearing\\nwhere his whole body could be seen. By his gigantic size, the doctor\\nrecognized a male of a superb species. He had two whitish tusks,\\nbeautifully curved, and about eight feet in length; and in these the\\nshanks of the anchor had firmly caught. The animal was vainly trying\\nwith his trunk to disengage himself from the rope that attached him to\\nthe car.\\n\\n\"Get up--go ahead, old fellow!\" shouted Joe, with delight, doing\\nhis best to urge this rather novel team. \"Here is a new style of\\ntravelling!--no more horses for me. An elephant, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"But where is he taking us to?\" said Kennedy, whose rifle itched in his\\ngrasp.\\n\\n\"He\\'s taking us exactly to where we want to go, my dear Dick. A little\\npatience!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Wig-a-more! wig-a-more!\\' as the Scotch country folks say,\" shouted\\nJoe, in high glee. \"Gee-up! gee-up there!\"\\n\\nThe huge animal now broke into a very rapid gallop. He flung his trunk\\nfrom side to side, and his monstrous bounds gave the car several rather\\nheavy thumps. Meanwhile the doctor stood ready, hatchet in hand, to cut\\nthe rope, should need arise.\\n\\n\"But,\" said he, \"we shall not give up our anchor until the last moment.\"\\n\\nThis drive, with an elephant for the team, lasted about an hour and a\\nhalf; yet the animal did not seem in the least fatigued. These immense\\ncreatures can go over a great deal of ground, and, from one day to\\nanother, are found at enormous distances from there they were last seen,\\nlike the whales, whose mass and speed they rival.\\n\\n\"In fact,\" said Joe, \"it\\'s a whale that we have harpooned; and we\\'re\\nonly doing just what whalemen do when out fishing.\"\\n\\nBut a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary\\nhis style of locomotion. A dense grove of calmadores was descried on\\nthe horizon, about three miles away, on the north of the prairie. So it\\nbecame necessary to detach the balloon from its draught-animal at last.\\n\\nKennedy was intrusted with the job of bringing the elephant to a halt.\\nHe drew his rifle to his shoulder, but his position was not favorable to\\na successful shot; so that the first ball fired flattened itself on\\nthe animal\\'s skull, as it would have done against an iron plate. The\\ncreature did not seem in the least troubled by it; but, at the sound of\\nthe discharge, he had increased his speed, and now was going as fast as\\na horse at full gallop.\\n\\n\"The deuce!\" ejaculated Kennedy.\\n\\n\"What a solid head!\" commented Joe.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll try some conical balls behind the shoulder-joint,\" said Kennedy,\\nreloading his rifle with care. In another moment he fired.\\n\\nThe animal gave a terrible cry, but went on faster than ever.\\n\\n\"Come!\" said Joe, taking aim with another gun, \"I must help you, or\\nwe\\'ll never end it.\" And now two balls penetrated the creature\\'s side.\\n\\nThe elephant halted, lifted his trunk, and resumed his run toward the\\nwood with all his speed; he shook his huge head, and the blood began to\\ngush from his wounds.\\n\\n\"Let us keep up our fire, Mr. Kennedy.\"\\n\\n\"And a continuous fire, too,\" urged the doctor, \"for we are close on the\\nwoods.\"\\n\\nTen shots more were discharged. The elephant made a fearful bound; the\\ncar and balloon cracked as though every thing were going to pieces, and\\nthe shock made the doctor drop his hatchet on the ground.\\n\\nThe situation was thus rendered really very alarming; the anchor-rope,\\nwhich had securely caught, could not be disengaged, nor could it yet be\\ncut by the knives of our aeronauts, and the balloon was rushing headlong\\ntoward the wood, when the animal received a ball in the eye just as he\\nlifted his head. On this he halted, faltered, his knees bent under him,\\nand he uncovered his whole flank to the assaults of his enemies in the\\nballoon.\\n\\n\"A bullet in his heart!\" said Kennedy, discharging one last rifle-shot.\\n\\nThe elephant uttered a long bellow of terror and agony, then raised\\nhimself up for a moment, twirling his trunk in the air, and finally fell\\nwith all his weight upon one of his tusks, which he broke off short. He\\nwas dead.\\n\\n\"His tusk\\'s broken!\" exclaimed Kennedy--\"ivory too that in England would\\nbring thirty-five guineas per hundred pounds.\"\\n\\n\"As much as that?\" said Joe, scrambling down to the ground by the\\nanchor-rope.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the use of sighing over it, Dick?\" said the doctor. \"Are we\\nivory merchants? Did we come hither to make money?\"\\n\\nJoe examined the anchor and found it solidly attached to the unbroken\\ntusk. The doctor and Dick leaped out on the ground, while the balloon,\\nnow half emptied, hovered over the body of the huge animal.\\n\\n\"What a splendid beast!\" said Kennedy, \"what a mass of flesh! I never\\nsaw an elephant of that size in India!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing surprising about that, my dear Dick; the elephants\\nof Central Africa are the finest in the world. The Andersons and the\\nCummings have hunted so incessantly in the neighborhood of the Cape,\\nthat these animals have migrated to the equator, where they are often\\nmet with in large herds.\"\\n\\n\"In the mean while, I hope,\" added Joe, \"that we\\'ll taste a morsel of\\nthis fellow. I\\'ll undertake to get you a good dinner at his expense. Mr.\\nKennedy will go off and hunt for an hour or two; the doctor will make an\\ninspection of the balloon, and, while they\\'re busy in that way, I\\'ll do\\nthe cooking.\"\\n\\n\"A good arrangement!\" said the doctor; \"so do as you like, Joe.\"\\n\\n\"As for me,\" said the hunter, \"I shall avail myself of the two hours\\'\\nrecess that Joe has condescended to let me have.\"\\n\\n\"Go, my friend, but no imprudence! Don\\'t wander too far away.\"\\n\\n\"Never fear, doctor!\" and, so saying, Dick, shouldering his gun, plunged\\ninto the woods.\\n\\nForthwith Joe went to work at his vocation. At first he made a hole in\\nthe ground two feet deep; this he filled with the dry wood that was so\\nabundantly scattered about, where it had been strewn by the elephants,\\nwhose tracks could be seen where they had made their way through the\\nforest. This hole filled, he heaped a pile of fagots on it a foot in\\nheight, and set fire to it.\\n\\nThen he went back to the carcass of the elephant, which had fallen only\\nabout a hundred feet from the edge of the forest; he next proceeded\\nadroitly to cut off the trunk, which might have been two feet in\\ndiameter at the base; of this he selected the most delicate portion, and\\nthen took with it one of the animal\\'s spongy feet. In fact, these are\\nthe finest morsels, like the hump of the bison, the paws of the bear,\\nand the head of the wild boar.\\n\\nWhen the pile of fagots had been thoroughly consumed, inside and\\noutside, the hole, cleared of the cinders and hot coals, retained a very\\nhigh temperature. The pieces of elephant-meat, surrounded with aromatic\\nleaves, were placed in this extempore oven and covered with hot coals.\\nThen Joe piled up a second heap of sticks over all, and when it had\\nburned out the meat was cooked to a turn.\\n\\nThen Joe took the viands from the oven, spread the savory mess upon\\ngreen leaves, and arranged his dinner upon a magnificent patch of\\ngreensward. He finally brought out some biscuit, some coffee, and some\\ncognac, and got a can of pure, fresh water from a neighboring streamlet.\\n\\nThe repast thus prepared was a pleasant sight to behold, and Joe,\\nwithout being too proud, thought that it would also be pleasant to eat.\\n\\n\"A journey without danger or fatigue,\" he soliloquized; \"your meals when\\nyou please; a swinging hammock all the time! What more could a man ask?\\nAnd there was Kennedy, who didn\\'t want to come!\"\\n\\nOn his part, Dr. Ferguson was engrossed in a serious and thorough\\nexamination of the balloon. The latter did not appear to have suffered\\nfrom the storm; the silk and the gutta percha had resisted wonderfully,\\nand, upon estimating the exact height of the ground and the ascensional\\nforce of the balloon, our aeronaut saw, with satisfaction, that the\\nhydrogen was in exactly the same quantity as before. The covering had\\nremained completely waterproof.\\n\\nIt was now only five days since our travellers had quitted Zanzibar;\\ntheir pemmican had not yet been touched; their stock of biscuit and\\npotted meat was enough for a long trip, and there was nothing to be\\nreplenished but the water.\\n\\nThe pipes and spiral seemed to be in perfect condition, since, thanks to\\ntheir india-rubber jointings, they had yielded to all the oscillations\\nof the balloon. His examination ended, the doctor betook himself to\\nsetting his notes in order. He made a very accurate sketch of the\\nsurrounding landscape, with its long prairie stretching away out of\\nsight, the forest of calmadores, and the balloon resting motionless over\\nthe body of the dead elephant.\\n\\nAt the end of his two hours, Kennedy returned with a string of fat\\npartridges and the haunch of an oryx, a sort of gemsbok belonging to the\\nmost agile species of antelopes. Joe took upon himself to prepare this\\nsurplus stock of provisions for a later repast.\\n\\n\"But, dinner\\'s ready!\" he shouted in his most musical voice.\\n\\nAnd the three travellers had only to sit down on the green turf. The\\ntrunk and feet of the elephant were declared to be exquisite. Old\\nEngland was toasted, as usual, and delicious Havanas perfumed this\\ncharming country for the first time.\\n\\nKennedy ate, drank, and chatted, like four; he was perfectly delighted\\nwith his new life, and seriously proposed to the doctor to settle in\\nthis forest, to construct a cabin of boughs and foliage, and, there and\\nthen, to lay the foundation of a Robinson Crusoe dynasty in Africa.\\n\\nThe proposition went no further, although Joe had, at once, selected the\\npart of Man Friday for himself.\\n\\nThe country seemed so quiet, so deserted, that the doctor resolved to\\npass the night on the ground, and Joe arranged a circle of watch-fires\\nas an indispensable barrier against wild animals, for the hyenas,\\ncougars, and jackals, attracted by the smell of the dead elephant,\\nwere prowling about in the neighborhood. Kennedy had to fire his rifle\\nseveral times at these unceremonious visitors, but the night passed\\nwithout any untoward occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.\\n\\nThe Karagwah.--Lake Ukereoue.--A Night on an Island.--The\\nEquator.--Crossing the Lake.--The Cascades.--A View of the Country.--The\\nSources of the Nile.--The Island of Benga.--The Signature of Andrea\\nDebono.--The Flag with the Arms of England.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock in the morning, preparations for departure commenced.\\nJoe, with the hatchet which he had fortunately recovered, broke the\\nelephant\\'s tusks. The balloon, restored to liberty, sped away to the\\nnorthwest with our travellers, at the rate of eighteen miles per hour.\\n\\nThe doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the\\nstars, during the preceding night. He knew that he was in latitude two\\ndegrees forty minutes below the equator, or at a distance of one hundred\\nand sixty geographical miles. He swept along over many villages without\\nheeding the cries that the appearance of the balloon excited; he took\\nnote of the conformation of places with quick sights; he passed the\\nslopes of the Rubemhe, which are nearly as abrupt as the summits of the\\nOusagara, and, farther on, at Tenga, encountered the first projections\\nof the Karagwah chains, which, in his opinion, are direct spurs of the\\nMountains of the Moon. So, the ancient legend which made these mountains\\nthe cradle of the Nile, came near to the truth, since they really border\\nupon Lake Ukereoue, the conjectured reservoir of the waters of the great\\nriver.\\n\\nFrom Kafuro, the main district of the merchants of that country, he\\ndescried, at length, on the horizon, the lake so much desired and so\\nlong sought for, of which Captain Speke caught a glimpse on the 3d of\\nAugust, 1858.\\n\\nSamuel Ferguson felt real emotion: he was almost in contact with one\\nof the principal points of his expedition, and, with his spy-glass\\nconstantly raised, he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious\\nregion in sight. His gaze wandered over details that might have been\\nthus described:\\n\\n\"Beneath him extended a country generally destitute of cultivation; only\\nhere and there some ravines seemed under tillage; the surface, dotted\\nwith peaks of medium height, grew flat as it approached the lake;\\nbarley-fields took the place of rice-plantations, and there, too, could\\nbe seen growing the species of plantain from which the wine of the\\ncountry is drawn, and mwani, the wild plant which supplies a substitute\\nfor coffee. A collection of some fifty or more circular huts, covered\\nwith a flowering thatch, constituted the capital of the Karagwah\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nHe could easily distinguish the astonished countenances of a rather\\nfine-looking race of natives of yellowish-brown complexion. Women\\nof incredible corpulence were dawdling about through the cultivated\\ngrounds, and the doctor greatly surprised his companions by informing\\nthem that this rotundity, which is highly esteemed in that region, was\\nobtained by an obligatory diet of curdled milk.\\n\\nAt noon, the Victoria was in one degree forty-five minutes south\\nlatitude, and at one o\\'clock the wind was driving her directly toward\\nthe lake.\\n\\nThis sheet of water was christened Uyanza Victoria, or Victoria Lake, by\\nCaptain Speke. At the place now mentioned it might measure about ninety\\nmiles in breadth, and at its southern extremity the captain found a\\ngroup of islets, which he named the Archipelago of Bengal. He pushed his\\nsurvey as far as Muanza, on the eastern coast, where he was received\\nby the sultan. He made a triangulation of this part of the lake, but\\nhe could not procure a boat, either to cross it or to visit the great\\nisland of Ukereoue which is very populous, is governed by three sultans,\\nand appears to be only a promontory at low tide.\\n\\nThe balloon approached the lake more to the northward, to the doctor\\'s\\ngreat regret, for it had been his wish to determine its lower outlines.\\nIts shores seemed to be thickly set with brambles and thorny plants,\\ngrowing together in wild confusion, and were literally hidden,\\nsometimes, from the gaze, by myriads of mosquitoes of a light-brown hue.\\nThe country was evidently habitable and inhabited. Troops of hippopotami\\ncould be seen disporting themselves in the forests of reeds, or plunging\\nbeneath the whitish waters of the lake.\\n\\nThe latter, seen from above, presented, toward the west, so broad an\\nhorizon that it might have been called a sea; the distance between the\\ntwo shores is so great that communication cannot be established, and\\nstorms are frequent and violent, for the winds sweep with fury over this\\nelevated and unsheltered basin.\\n\\nThe doctor experienced some difficulty in guiding his course; he was\\nafraid of being carried toward the east, but, fortunately, a current\\nbore him directly toward the north, and at six o\\'clock in the evening\\nthe balloon alighted on a small desert island in thirty minutes south\\nlatitude, and thirty-two degrees fifty-two minutes east longitude, about\\ntwenty miles from the shore.\\n\\nThe travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree, and, the wind having\\nfallen calm toward evening, they remained quietly at anchor. They dared\\nnot dream of taking the ground, since here, as on the shores of the\\nUyanza, legions of mosquitoes covered the soil in dense clouds. Joe even\\ncame back, from securing the anchor in the tree, speckled with bites,\\nbut he kept his temper, because he found it quite the natural thing for\\nmosquitoes to treat him as they had done.\\n\\nNevertheless, the doctor, who was less of an optimist, let out as much\\nrope as he could, so as to escape these pitiless insects, that began to\\nrise toward him with a threatening hum.\\n\\nThe doctor ascertained the height of the lake above the level of the\\nsea, as it had been determined by Captain Speke, say three thousand\\nseven hundred and fifty feet.\\n\\n\"Here we are, then, on an island!\" said Joe, scratching as though he\\'d\\ntear his nails out.\\n\\n\"We could make the tour of it in a jiffy,\" added Kennedy, \"and,\\nexcepting these confounded mosquitoes, there\\'s not a living being to be\\nseen on it.\"\\n\\n\"The islands with which the lake is dotted,\" replied the doctor, \"are\\nnothing, after all, but the tops of submerged hills; but we are lucky\\nto have found a retreat among them, for the shores of the lake are\\ninhabited by ferocious tribes. Take your sleep, then, since Providence\\nhas granted us a tranquil night.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you do the same, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"No, I could not close my eyes. My thoughts would banish sleep.\\nTo-morrow, my friends, should the wind prove favorable, we shall go due\\nnorth, and we shall, perhaps, discover the sources of the Nile, that\\ngrand secret which has so long remained impenetrable. Near as we are to\\nthe sources of the renowned river, I could not sleep.\"\\n\\nKennedy and Joe, whom scientific speculations failed to disturb to that\\nextent, were not long in falling into sound slumber, while the doctor\\nheld his post.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, April 23d, the balloon started at four o\\'clock in the\\nmorning, with a grayish sky overhead; night was slow in quitting the\\nsurface of the lake, which was enveloped in a dense fog, but presently a\\nviolent breeze scattered all the mists, and, after the balloon had been\\nswung to and fro for a moment, in opposite directions, it at length\\nveered in a straight line toward the north.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson fairly clapped his hands for joy.\\n\\n\"We are on the right track!\" he exclaimed. \"To-day or never we shall see\\nthe Nile! Look, my friends, we are crossing the equator! We are entering\\nour own hemisphere!\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Joe, \"do you think, doctor, that the equator passes here?\"\\n\\n\"Just here, my boy!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, with all respect to you, sir, it seems to me that this is\\nthe very time to moisten it.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" said the doctor, laughing. \"Let us have a glass of punch. You\\nhave a way of comprehending cosmography that is any thing but dull.\"\\n\\nAnd thus was the passage of the Victoria over the equator duly\\ncelebrated.\\n\\nThe balloon made rapid headway. In the west could be seen a low and but\\nslightly-diversified coast, and, farther away in the background, the\\nelevated plains of the Uganda and the Usoga. At length, the rapidity of\\nthe wind became excessive, approaching thirty miles per hour.\\n\\nThe waters of the Nyanza, violently agitated, were foaming like the\\nbillows of a sea. By the appearance of certain long swells that followed\\nthe sinking of the waves, the doctor was enabled to conclude that the\\nlake must have great depth of water. Only one or two rude boats were\\nseen during this rapid passage.\\n\\n\"This lake is evidently, from its elevated position, the natural\\nreservoir of the rivers in the eastern part of Africa, and the sky gives\\nback to it in rain what it takes in vapor from the streams that flow out\\nof it. I am certain that the Nile must here take its rise.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we shall see!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\nAbout nine o\\'clock they drew nearer to the western coast. It seemed\\ndeserted, and covered with woods; the wind freshened a little toward the\\neast, and the other shore of the lake could be seen. It bent around in\\nsuch a curve as to end in a wide angle toward two degrees forty minutes\\nnorth latitude. Lofty mountains uplifted their arid peaks at this\\nextremity of Nyanza; but, between them, a deep and winding gorge gave\\nexit to a turbulent and foaming river.\\n\\nWhile busy managing the balloon, Dr. Ferguson never ceased reconnoitring\\nthe country with eager eyes.\\n\\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed, \"look, my friends! the statements of the Arabs\\nwere correct! They spoke of a river by which Lake Ukereoue discharged\\nits waters toward the north, and this river exists, and we are\\ndescending it, and it flows with a speed analogous to our own! And this\\ndrop of water now gliding away beneath our feet is, beyond all question,\\nrushing on, to mingle with the Mediterranean! It is the Nile!\"\\n\\n\"It is the Nile!\" reeechoed Kennedy, carried away by the enthusiasm of\\nhis friend.\\n\\n\"Hurrah for the Nile!\" shouted Joe, glad, and always ready to cheer for\\nsomething.\\n\\nEnormous rocks, here and there, embarrassed the course of this\\nmysterious river. The water foamed as it fell in rapids and cataracts,\\nwhich confirmed the doctor in his preconceived ideas on the subject.\\nFrom the environing mountains numerous torrents came plunging and\\nseething down, and the eye could take them in by hundreds. There could\\nbe seen, starting from the soil, delicate jets of water scattering in\\nall directions, crossing and recrossing each other, mingling, contending\\nin the swiftness of their progress, and all rushing toward that nascent\\nstream which became a river after having drunk them in.\\n\\n\"Here is, indeed, the Nile!\" reiterated the doctor, with the tone of\\nprofound conviction. \"The origin of its name, like the origin of its\\nwaters, has fired the imagination of the learned; they have sought to\\ntrace it from the Greek, the Coptic, the Sanscrit; but all that matters\\nlittle now, since we have made it surrender the secret of its source!\"\\n\\n\"But,\" said the Scotchman, \"how are you to make sure of the identity of\\nthis river with the one recognized by the travellers from the north?\"\\n\\n\"We shall have certain, irrefutable, convincing, and infallible proof,\"\\nreplied Ferguson, \"should the wind hold another hour in our favor!\"\\n\\nThe mountains drew farther apart, revealing in their place numerous\\nvillages, and fields of white Indian corn, doura, and sugar-cane. The\\ntribes inhabiting the region seemed excited and hostile; they manifested\\nmore anger than adoration, and evidently saw in the aeronauts only\\nobtrusive strangers, and not condescending deities. It appeared as\\nthough, in approaching the sources of the Nile, these men came to rob\\nthem of something, and so the Victoria had to keep out of range of their\\nmuskets.\\n\\n\"To land here would be a ticklish matter!\" said the Scot.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Joe, \"so much the worse for these natives. They\\'ll have to\\ndo without the pleasure of our conversation.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, descend I must,\" said the doctor, \"were it only for a\\nquarter of an hour. Without doing so I cannot verify the results of our\\nexpedition.\"\\n\\n\"It is indispensable, then, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Indispensable; and we will descend, even if we have to do so with a\\nvolley of musketry.\"\\n\\n\"The thing suits me,\" said Kennedy, toying with his pet rifle.\\n\\n\"And I\\'m ready, master, whenever you say the word!\" added Joe, preparing\\nfor the fight.\\n\\n\"It would not be the first time,\" remarked the doctor, \"that science\\nhas been followed up, sword in hand. The same thing happened to a\\nFrench savant among the mountains of Spain, when he was measuring the\\nterrestrial meridian.\"\\n\\n\"Be easy on that score, doctor, and trust to your two body-guards.\"\\n\\n\"Are we there, master?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet. In fact, I shall go up a little, first, in order to get an\\nexact idea of the configuration of the country.\"\\n\\nThe hydrogen expanded, and in less than ten minutes the balloon was\\nsoaring at a height of twenty-five hundred feet above the ground.\\n\\nFrom that elevation could be distinguished an inextricable network of\\nsmaller streams which the river received into its bosom; others came\\nfrom the west, from between numerous hills, in the midst of fertile\\nplains.\\n\\n\"We are not ninety miles from Gondokoro,\" said the doctor, measuring\\noff the distance on his map, \"and less than five miles from the point\\nreached by the explorers from the north. Let us descend with great\\ncare.\"\\n\\nAnd, upon this, the balloon was lowered about two thousand feet.\\n\\n\"Now, my friends, let us be ready, come what may.\"\\n\\n\"Ready it is!\" said Dick and Joe, with one voice.\\n\\n\"Good!\"\\n\\nIn a few moments the balloon was advancing along the bed of the river,\\nand scarcely one hundred feet above the ground. The Nile measured but\\nfifty fathoms in width at this point, and the natives were in great\\nexcitement, rushing to and fro, tumultuously, in the villages that lined\\nthe banks of the stream. At the second degree it forms a perpendicular\\ncascade of ten feet in height, and consequently impassable by boats.\\n\\n\"Here, then, is the cascade mentioned by Debono!\" exclaimed the doctor.\\n\\nThe basin of the river spread out, dotted with numerous islands, which\\nDr. Ferguson devoured with his eyes. He seemed to be seeking for a point\\nof reference which he had not yet found.\\n\\nBy this time, some blacks, having ventured in a boat just under the\\nballoon, Kennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle, that made them\\nregain the bank at their utmost speed.\\n\\n\"A good journey to you,\" bawled Joe, \"and if I were in your place, I\\nwouldn\\'t try coming back again. I should be mightily afraid of a monster\\nthat can hurl thunderbolts when he pleases.\"\\n\\nBut, all at once, the doctor snatched up his spy-glass, and directed it\\ntoward an island reposing in the middle of the river.\\n\\n\"Four trees!\" he exclaimed; \"look, down there!\" Sure enough, there were\\nfour trees standing alone at one end of it.\\n\\n\"It is Bengal Island! It is the very same,\" repeated the doctor,\\nexultingly.\\n\\n\"And what of that?\" asked Dick.\\n\\n\"It is there that we shall alight, if God permits.\"\\n\\n\"But, it seems to be inhabited, doctor.\"\\n\\n\"Joe is right; and, unless I\\'m mistaken, there is a group of about a\\nscore of natives on it now.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll make them scatter; there\\'ll be no great trouble in that,\"\\nresponded Ferguson.\\n\\n\"So be it,\" chimed in the hunter.\\n\\nThe sun was at the zenith as the balloon approached the island.\\n\\nThe blacks, who were members of the Makado tribe, were howling lustily,\\nand one of them waved his bark hat in the air. Kennedy took aim at\\nhim, fired, and his hat flew about him in pieces. Thereupon there was a\\ngeneral scamper. The natives plunged headlong into the river, and swam\\nto the opposite bank. Immediately, there came a shower of balls from\\nboth banks, along with a perfect cloud of arrows, but without doing the\\nballoon any damage, where it rested with its anchor snugly secured in\\nthe fissure of a rock. Joe lost no time in sliding to the ground.\\n\\n\"The ladder!\" cried the doctor. \"Follow me, Kennedy.\"\\n\\n\"What do you wish, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Let us alight. I want a witness.\"\\n\\n\"Here I am!\"\\n\\n\"Mind your post, Joe, and keep a good lookout.\"\\n\\n\"Never fear, doctor; I\\'ll answer for all that.\"\\n\\n\"Come, Dick,\" said the doctor, as he touched the ground.\\n\\nSo saying, he drew his companion along toward a group of rocks that rose\\nupon one point of the island; there, after searching for some time, he\\nbegan to rummage among the brambles, and, in so doing, scratched his\\nhands until they bled.\\n\\nSuddenly he grasped Kennedy\\'s arm, exclaiming: \"Look! look!\"\\n\\n\"Letters!\"\\n\\nYes; there, indeed, could be descried, with perfect precision of\\noutline, some letters carved on the rock. It was quite easy to make them\\nout:\\n\\n\"A. D.\"\\n\\n\"A.D.!\" repeated Dr. Ferguson. \"Andrea Debono--the very signature of the\\ntraveller who farthest ascended the current of the Nile.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt of that, friend Samuel,\" assented Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Are you now convinced?\"\\n\\n\"It is the Nile! We cannot entertain a doubt on that score now,\" was the\\nreply.\\n\\nThe doctor, for the last time, examined those precious initials, the\\nexact form and size of which he carefully noted.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said he--\"now for the balloon!\"\\n\\n\"Quickly, then, for I see some of the natives getting ready to recross\\nthe river.\"\\n\\n\"That matters little to us now. Let the wind but send us northward for a\\nfew hours, and we shall reach Gondokoro, and press the hands of some of\\nour countrymen.\"\\n\\nTen minutes more, and the balloon was majestically ascending, while Dr.\\nFerguson, in token of success, waved the English flag triumphantly from\\nhis car.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEENTH.\\n\\nThe Nile.--The Trembling Mountain.--A Remembrance of the\\nCountry.--The Narratives of the Arabs.--The Nyam-Nyams.--Joe\\'s\\nShrewd Cogitations.--The Balloon runs the Gantlet.--Aerostatic\\nAscensions.--Madame Blanchard.\\n\\n\"Which way do we head?\" asked Kennedy, as he saw his friend consulting\\nthe compass.\\n\\n\"North-northeast.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce! but that\\'s not the north?\"\\n\\n\"No, Dick; and I\\'m afraid that we shall have some trouble in getting\\nto Gondokoro. I am sorry for it; but, at last, we have succeeded in\\nconnecting the explorations from the east with those from the north; and\\nwe must not complain.\"\\n\\nThe balloon was now receding gradually from the Nile.\\n\\n\"One last look,\" said the doctor, \"at this impassable latitude, beyond\\nwhich the most intrepid travellers could not make their way. There are\\nthose intractable tribes, of whom Petherick, Arnaud, Miuni, and the\\nyoung traveller Lejean, to whom we are indebted for the best work on the\\nUpper Nile, have spoken.\"\\n\\n\"Thus, then,\" added Kennedy, inquiringly, \"our discoveries agree with\\nthe speculations of science.\"\\n\\n\"Absolutely so. The sources of the White Nile, of the Bahr-el-Abiad,\\nare immersed in a lake as large as a sea; it is there that it takes its\\nrise. Poesy, undoubtedly, loses something thereby. People were fond of\\nascribing a celestial origin to this king of rivers. The ancients gave\\nit the name of an ocean, and were not far from believing that it flowed\\ndirectly from the sun; but we must come down from these flights from\\ntime to time, and accept what science teaches us. There will not always\\nbe scientific men, perhaps; but there always will be poets.\"\\n\\n\"We can still see cataracts,\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Those are the cataracts of Makedo, in the third degree of latitude.\\nNothing could be more accurate. Oh, if we could only have followed the\\ncourse of the Nile for a few hours!\"\\n\\n\"And down yonder, below us, I see the top of a mountain,\" said the\\nhunter.\\n\\n\"That is Mount Longwek, the Trembling Mountain of the Arabs. This whole\\ncountry was visited by Debono, who went through it under the name of\\nLatif-Effendi. The tribes living near the Nile are hostile to each\\nother, and are continually waging a war of extermination. You may form\\nsome idea, then, of the difficulties he had to encounter.\"\\n\\nThe wind was carrying the balloon toward the northwest, and, in order to\\navoid Mount Longwek, it was necessary to seek a more slanting current.\\n\\n\"My friends,\" said the doctor, \"here is where OUR passage of the African\\nContinent really commences; up to this time we have been following the\\ntraces of our predecessors. Henceforth we are to launch ourselves upon\\nthe unknown. We shall not lack the courage, shall we?\"\\n\\n\"Never!\" said Dick and Joe together, almost in a shout.\\n\\n\"Onward, then, and may we have the help of Heaven!\"\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock at night, after passing over ravines, forests, and\\nscattered villages, the aeronauts reached the side of the Trembling\\nMountain, along whose gentle slopes they went quietly gliding. In that\\nmemorable day, the 23d of April, they had, in fifteen hours, impelled\\nby a rapid breeze, traversed a distance of more than three hundred and\\nfifteen miles.\\n\\nBut this latter part of the journey had left them in dull spirits, and\\ncomplete silence reigned in the car. Was Dr. Ferguson absorbed in the\\nthought of his discoveries? Were his two companions thinking of their\\ntrip through those unknown regions? There were, no doubt, mingled\\nwith these reflections, the keenest reminiscences of home and distant\\nfriends. Joe alone continued to manifest the same careless philosophy,\\nfinding it QUITE NATURAL that home should not be there, from the moment\\nthat he left it; but he respected the silent mood of his friends, the\\ndoctor and Kennedy.\\n\\nAbout ten the balloon anchored on the side of the Trembling Mountain,\\nso called, because, in Arab tradition, it is said to tremble the instant\\nthat a Mussulman sets foot upon it. The travellers then partook of a\\nsubstantial meal, and all quietly passed the night as usual, keeping the\\nregular watches.\\n\\nOn awaking the next morning, they all had pleasanter feelings. The\\nweather was fine, and the wind was blowing from the right quarter; so\\nthat a good breakfast, seasoned with Joe\\'s merry pranks, put them in\\nhigh good-humor.\\n\\nThe region they were now crossing is very extensive. It borders on the\\nMountains of the Moon on one side, and those of Darfur on the other--a\\nspace about as broad as Europe.\\n\\n\"We are, no doubt, crossing what is supposed to be the kingdom of Usoga.\\nGeographers have pretended that there existed, in the centre of Africa,\\na vast depression, an immense central lake. We shall see whether there\\nis any truth in that idea,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"But how did they come to think so?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"From the recitals of the Arabs. Those fellows are great narrators--too\\nmuch so, probably. Some travellers, who had got as far as Kazeh, or\\nthe great lakes, saw slaves that had been brought from this region;\\ninterrogated them concerning it, and, from their different narratives,\\nmade up a jumble of notions, and deduced systems from them. Down at the\\nbottom of it all there is some appearance of truth; and you see that\\nthey were right about the sources of the Nile.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing could be more correct,\" said Kennedy. \"It was by the aid of\\nthese documents that some attempts at maps were made, and so I am going\\nto try to follow our route by one of them, rectifying it when need be.\"\\n\\n\"Is all this region inhabited?\" asked Joe.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; and disagreeably inhabited, too.\"\\n\\n\"I thought so.\"\\n\\n\"These scattered tribes come, one and all, under the title of\\nNyam-Nyams, and this compound word is only a sort of nickname. It\\nimitates the sound of chewing.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it! Excellent!\" said Joe, champing his teeth as though he were\\neating; \"Nyam-Nyam.\"\\n\\n\"My good Joe, if you were the immediate object of this chewing, you\\nwouldn\\'t find it so excellent.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s the reason, sir?\"\\n\\n\"These tribes are considered man-eaters.\"\\n\\n\"Is that really the case?\"\\n\\n\"Not a doubt of it! It has also been asserted that these natives had\\ntails, like mere quadrupeds; but it was soon discovered that these\\nappendages belonged to the skins of animals that they wore for\\nclothing.\"\\n\\n\"More\\'s the pity! a tail\\'s a nice thing to chase away mosquitoes.\"\\n\\n\"That may be, Joe; but we must consign the story to the domain of fable,\\nlike the dogs\\' heads which the traveller, Brun-Rollet, attributed to\\nother tribes.\"\\n\\n\"Dogs\\' heads, eh? Quite convenient for barking, and even for\\nman-eating!\"\\n\\n\"But one thing that has been, unfortunately, proven true, is, the\\nferocity of these tribes, who are really very fond of human flesh, and\\ndevour it with avidity.\"\\n\\n\"I only hope that they won\\'t take such a particular fancy to mine!\" said\\nJoe, with comic solemnity.\\n\\n\"See that!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, sir; if I have to be eaten, in a moment of famine, I want\\nit to be for your benefit and my master\\'s; but the idea of feeding those\\nblack fellows--gracious! I\\'d die of shame!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, Joe,\" said Kennedy, \"that\\'s understood; we count upon you\\nin case of need!\"\\n\\n\"At your service, gentlemen!\"\\n\\n\"Joe talks in this way so as to make us take good care of him, and\\nfatten him up.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe so!\" said Joe. \"Every man for himself.\"\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the sky became covered with a warm mist, that oozed\\nfrom the soil; the brownish vapor scarcely allowed the beholder to\\ndistinguish objects, and so, fearing collision with some unexpected\\nmountain-peak, the doctor, about five o\\'clock, gave the signal to halt.\\n\\nThe night passed without accident, but in such profound obscurity, that\\nit was necessary to use redoubled vigilance.\\n\\nThe monsoon blew with extreme violence during all the next morning. The\\nwind buried itself in the lower cavities of the balloon and shook the\\nappendage by which the dilating-pipes entered the main apparatus. They\\nhad, at last, to be tied up with cords, Joe acquitting himself very\\nskilfully in performing that operation.\\n\\nHe had occasion to observe, at the same time, that the orifice of the\\nballoon still remained hermetically sealed.\\n\\n\"That is a matter of double importance for us,\" said the doctor; \"in the\\nfirst place, we avoid the escape of precious gas, and then, again, we\\ndo not leave behind us an inflammable train, which we should at last\\ninevitably set fire to, and so be consumed.\"\\n\\n\"That would be a disagreeable travelling incident!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Should we be hurled to the ground?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Hurled! No, not quite that. The gas would burn quietly, and we should\\ndescend little by little. A similar accident happened to a French\\naeronaut, Madame Blanchard. She ignited her balloon while sending off\\nfireworks, but she did not fall, and she would not have been killed,\\nprobably, had not her car dashed against a chimney and precipitated her\\nto the ground.\"\\n\\n\"Let us hope that nothing of the kind may happen to us,\" said the\\nhunter. \"Up to this time our trip has not seemed to me very dangerous,\\nand I can see nothing to prevent us reaching our destination.\"\\n\\n\"Nor can I either, my dear Dick; accidents are generally caused by the\\nimprudence of the aeronauts, or the defective construction of their\\napparatus. However, in thousands of aerial ascensions, there have not\\nbeen twenty fatal accidents. Usually, the danger is in the moment of\\nleaving the ground, or of alighting, and therefore at those junctures we\\nshould never omit the utmost precaution.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s breakfast-time,\" said Joe; \"we\\'ll have to put up with preserved\\nmeat and coffee until Mr. Kennedy has had another chance to get us a\\ngood slice of venison.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTIETH.\\n\\nThe Celestial Bottle.--The Fig-Palms.--The Mammoth Trees.--The Tree of\\nWar.--The Winged Team.--Two Native Tribes in Battle.--A Massacre.--An\\nIntervention from above.\\n\\nThe wind had become violent and irregular; the balloon was running\\nthe gantlet through the air. Tossed at one moment toward the north, at\\nanother toward the south, it could not find one steady current.\\n\\n\"We are moving very swiftly without advancing much,\" said Kennedy,\\nremarking the frequent oscillations of the needle of the compass.\\n\\n\"The balloon is rushing at the rate of at least thirty miles an hour.\\nLean over, and see how the country is gliding away beneath us!\" said the\\ndoctor.\\n\\n\"See! that forest looks as though it were precipitating itself upon us!\"\\n\\n\"The forest has become a clearing!\" added the other.\\n\\n\"And the clearing a village!\" continued Joe, a moment or two later.\\n\"Look at the faces of those astonished darkys!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it\\'s natural enough that they should be astonished,\" said the\\ndoctor. \"The French peasants, when they first saw a balloon, fired\\nat it, thinking that it was an aerial monster. A Soudan negro may be\\nexcused, then, for opening his eyes VERY wide!\"\\n\\n\"Faith!\" said Joe, as the Victoria skimmed closely along the ground,\\nat scarcely the elevation of one hundred feet, and immediately over a\\nvillage, \"I\\'ll throw them an empty bottle, with your leave, doctor, and\\nif it reaches them safe and sound, they\\'ll worship it; if it breaks,\\nthey\\'ll make talismans of the pieces.\"\\n\\nSo saying, he flung out a bottle, which, of course, was broken into a\\nthousand fragments, while the negroes scampered into their round huts,\\nuttering shrill cries.\\n\\nA little farther on, Kennedy called out: \"Look at that strange tree! The\\nupper part is of one kind and the lower part of another!\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Joe, \"here\\'s a country where the trees grow on top of each\\nother.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s simply the trunk of a fig-tree,\" replied the doctor, \"on which\\nthere is a little vegetating earth. Some fine day, the wind left the\\nseed of a palm on it, and the seed has taken root and grown as though it\\nwere on the plain ground.\"\\n\\n\"A fine new style of gardening,\" said Joe, \"and I\\'ll import the idea\\nto England. It would be just the thing in the London parks; without\\ncounting that it would be another way to increase the number of\\nfruit-trees. We could have gardens up in the air; and the small\\nhouse-owners would like that!\"\\n\\nAt this moment, they had to raise the balloon so as to pass over a\\nforest of trees that were more than three hundred feet in height--a kind\\nof ancient banyan.\\n\\n\"What magnificent trees!\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"I never saw any thing so\\nfine as the appearance of these venerable forests. Look, doctor!\"\\n\\n\"The height of these banyans is really remarkable, my dear Dick; and\\nyet, they would be nothing astonishing in the New World.\"\\n\\n\"Why, are there still loftier trees in existence?\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; among the \\'mammoth trees\\' of California, there is a cedar\\nfour hundred and eighty feet in height. It would overtop the Houses\\nof Parliament, and even the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The trunk at the\\nsurface of the ground was one hundred and twenty feet in circumference,\\nand the concentric layers of the wood disclosed an age of more than four\\nthousand years.\"\\n\\n\"But then, sir, there was nothing wonderful in it! When one has lived\\nfour thousand years, one ought to be pretty tall!\" was Joe\\'s remark.\\n\\nMeanwhile, during the doctor\\'s recital and Joe\\'s response, the forest\\nhad given place to a large collection of huts surrounding an open space.\\nIn the middle of this grew a solitary tree, and Joe exclaimed, as he\\ncaught sight of it:\\n\\n\"Well! if that tree has produced such flowers as those, for the last\\nfour thousand years, I have to offer it my compliments, anyhow,\" and he\\npointed to a gigantic sycamore, whose whole trunk was covered with human\\nbones. The flowers of which Joe spoke were heads freshly severed from\\nthe bodies, and suspended by daggers thrust into the bark of the tree.\\n\\n\"The war-tree of these cannibals!\" said the doctor; \"the Indians merely\\ncarry off the scalp, but these negroes take the whole head.\"\\n\\n\"A mere matter of fashion!\" said Joe. But, already, the village and the\\nbleeding heads were disappearing on the horizon. Another place offered\\na still more revolting spectacle--half-devoured corpses; skeletons\\nmouldering to dust; human limbs scattered here and there, and left to\\nfeed the jackals and hyenas.\\n\\n\"No doubt, these are the bodies of criminals; according to the custom\\nin Abyssinia, these people have left them a prey to the wild beasts, who\\nkill them with their terrible teeth and claws, and then devour them at\\ntheir leisure.\\n\\n\"Not a whit more cruel than hanging!\" said the Scot; \"filthier, that\\'s\\nall!\"\\n\\n\"In the southern regions of Africa, they content themselves,\" resumed\\nthe doctor, \"with shutting up the criminal in his own hut with his\\ncattle, and sometimes with his family. They then set fire to the hut,\\nand the whole party are burned together. I call that cruel; but, like\\nfriend Kennedy, I think that the gallows is quite as cruel, quite as\\nbarbarous.\"\\n\\nJoe, by the aid of his keen sight, which he did not fail to use\\ncontinually, noticed some flocks of birds of prey flitting about the\\nhorizon.\\n\\n\"They are eagles!\" exclaimed Kennedy, after reconnoitring them through\\nthe glass, \"magnificent birds, whose flight is as rapid as ours.\"\\n\\n\"Heaven preserve us from their attacks!\" said the doctor, \"they are more\\nto be feared by us than wild beasts or savage tribes.\"\\n\\n\"Bah!\" said the hunter, \"we can drive them off with a few rifle-shots.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, I would prefer, dear Dick, not having to rely upon your\\nskill, this time, for the silk of our balloon could not resist their\\nsharp beaks; fortunately, the huge birds will, I believe, be more\\nfrightened than attracted by our machine.\"\\n\\n\"Yes! but a new idea, and I have dozens of them,\" said Joe; \"if we could\\nonly manage to capture a team of live eagles, we could hitch them to the\\nballoon, and they\\'d haul us through the air!\"\\n\\n\"The thing has been seriously proposed,\" replied the doctor, \"but I\\nthink it hardly practicable with creatures naturally so restive.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! we\\'d tame them,\" said Joe. \"Instead of driving them with bits, we\\'d\\ndo it with eye-blinkers that would cover their eyes. Half blinded in\\nthat way, they\\'d go to the right or to the left, as we desired; when\\nblinded completely, they would stop.\"\\n\\n\"Allow me, Joe, to prefer a favorable wind to your team of eagles. It\\ncosts less for fodder, and is more reliable.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you may have your choice, master, but I stick to my idea.\"\\n\\nIt now was noon. The Victoria had been going at a more moderate speed\\nfor some time; the country merely passed below it; it no longer flew.\\n\\nSuddenly, shouts and whistlings were heard by our aeronauts, and,\\nleaning over the edge of the car, they saw on the open plain below them\\nan exciting spectacle.\\n\\nTwo hostile tribes were fighting furiously, and the air was dotted with\\nvolleys of arrows. The combatants were so intent upon their murderous\\nwork that they did not notice the arrival of the balloon; there were\\nabout three hundred mingled confusedly in the deadly struggle: most of\\nthem, red with the blood of the wounded, in which they fairly wallowed,\\nwere horrible to behold.\\n\\nAs they at last caught sight of the balloon, there was a momentary\\npause; but their yells redoubled, and some arrows were shot at the\\nVictoria, one of them coming close enough for Joe to catch it with his\\nhand.\\n\\n\"Let us rise out of range,\" exclaimed the doctor; \"there must be no\\nrashness! We are forbidden any risk.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the massacre continued on both sides, with battle-axes and\\nwar-clubs; as quickly as one of the combatants fell, a hostile warrior\\nran up to cut off his head, while the women, mingling in the fray,\\ngathered up these bloody trophies, and piled them together at either\\nextremity of the battle-field. Often, too, they even fought for these\\nhideous spoils.\\n\\n\"What a frightful scene!\" said Kennedy, with profound disgust.\\n\\n\"They\\'re ugly acquaintances!\" added Joe; \"but then, if they had uniforms\\nthey\\'d be just like the fighters of all the rest of the world!\"\\n\\n\"I have a keen hankering to take a hand in at that fight,\" said the\\nhunter, brandishing his rifle.\\n\\n\"No! no!\" objected the doctor, vehemently; \"no, let us not meddle with\\nwhat don\\'t concern us. Do you know which is right or which is wrong,\\nthat you would assume the part of the Almighty? Let us, rather, hurry\\naway from this revolting spectacle. Could the great captains of the\\nworld float thus above the scenes of their exploits, they would at last,\\nperhaps, conceive a disgust for blood and conquest.\"\\n\\nThe chieftain of one of the contending parties was remarkable for his\\nathletic proportions, his great height, and herculean strength. With\\none hand he plunged his spear into the compact ranks of his enemies, and\\nwith the other mowed large spaces in them with his battle-axe. Suddenly\\nhe flung away his war-club, red with blood, rushed upon a wounded\\nwarrior, and, chopping off his arm at a single stroke, carried the\\ndissevered member to his mouth, and bit it again and again.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Kennedy, \"the horrible brute! I can hold back no\\nlonger,\" and, as he spoke, the huge savage, struck full in the forehead\\nwith a rifle-ball, fell headlong to the ground.\\n\\nUpon this sudden mishap of their leader, his warriors seemed struck dumb\\nwith amazement; his supernatural death awed them, while it reanimated\\nthe courage and ardor of their adversaries, and, in a twinkling, the\\nfield was abandoned by half the combatants.\\n\\n\"Come, let us look higher up for a current to bear us away. I am sick of\\nthis spectacle,\" said the doctor.\\n\\nBut they could not get away so rapidly as to avoid the sight of the\\nvictorious tribe rushing upon the dead and the wounded, scrambling and\\ndisputing for the still warm and reeking flesh, and eagerly devouring\\nit.\\n\\n\"Faugh!\" uttered Joe, \"it\\'s sickening.\"\\n\\nThe balloon rose as it expanded; the howlings of the brutal horde, in\\nthe delirium of their orgy, pursued them for a few minutes; but, at\\nlength, borne away toward the south, they were carried out of sight and\\nhearing of this horrible spectacle of cannibalism.\\n\\nThe surface of the country was now greatly varied, with numerous streams\\nof water, bearing toward the east. The latter, undoubtedly, ran into\\nthose affluents of Lake Nu, or of the River of the Gazelles, concerning\\nwhich M. Guillaume Lejean has given such curious details.\\n\\nAt nightfall, the balloon cast anchor in twenty-seven degrees east\\nlongitude, and four degrees twenty minutes north latitude, after a day\\'s\\ntrip of one hundred and fifty miles.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.\\n\\nStrange Sounds.--A Night Attack.--Kennedy and Joe in the Tree.--Two\\nShots.--\"Help! help!\"--Reply in French.--The Morning.--The\\nMissionary.--The Plan of Rescue.\\n\\nThe night came on very dark. The doctor had not been able to reconnoitre\\nthe country. He had made fast to a very tall tree, from which he could\\ndistinguish only a confused mass through the gloom.\\n\\nAs usual, he took the nine-o\\'clock watch, and at midnight Dick relieved\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Keep a sharp lookout, Dick!\" was the doctor\\'s good-night injunction.\\n\\n\"Is there any thing new on the carpet?\"\\n\\n\"No; but I thought that I heard vague sounds below us, and, as I don\\'t\\nexactly know where the wind has carried us to, even an excess of caution\\nwould do no harm.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve probably heard the cries of wild beasts.\"\\n\\n\"No! the sounds seemed to me something altogether different from that;\\nat all events, on the least alarm don\\'t fail to waken us.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do so, doctor; rest easy.\"\\n\\nAfter listening attentively for a moment or two longer, the doctor,\\nhearing nothing more, threw himself on his blankets and went asleep.\\n\\nThe sky was covered with dense clouds, but not a breath of air was\\nstirring; and the balloon, kept in its place by only a single anchor,\\nexperienced not the slightest oscillation.\\n\\nKennedy, leaning his elbow on the edge of the car, so as to keep an eye\\non the cylinder, which was actively at work, gazed out upon the calm\\nobscurity; he eagerly scanned the horizon, and, as often happens to\\nminds that are uneasy or possessed with preconceived notions, he fancied\\nthat he sometimes detected vague gleams of light in the distance.\\n\\nAt one moment he even thought that he saw them only two hundred paces\\naway, quite distinctly, but it was a mere flash that was gone as quickly\\nas it came, and he noticed nothing more. It was, no doubt, one of those\\nluminous illusions that sometimes impress the eye in the midst of very\\nprofound darkness.\\n\\nKennedy was getting over his nervousness and falling into his wandering\\nmeditations again, when a sharp whistle pierced his ear.\\n\\nWas that the cry of an animal or of a night-bird, or did it come from\\nhuman lips?\\n\\nKennedy, perfectly comprehending the gravity of the situation, was on\\nthe point of waking his companions, but he reflected that, in any case,\\nmen or animals, the creatures that he had heard must be out of reach.\\nSo he merely saw that his weapons were all right, and then, with his\\nnight-glass, again plunged his gaze into space.\\n\\nIt was not long before he thought he could perceive below him vague\\nforms that seemed to be gliding toward the tree, and then, by the aid of\\na ray of moonlight that shot like an electric flash between two masses\\nof cloud, he distinctly made out a group of human figures moving in the\\nshadow.\\n\\nThe adventure with the dog-faced baboons returned to his memory, and he\\nplaced his hand on the doctor\\'s shoulder.\\n\\nThe latter was awake in a moment.\\n\\n\"Silence!\" said Dick. \"Let us speak below our breath.\"\\n\\n\"Has any thing happened?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, let us waken Joe.\"\\n\\nThe instant that Joe was aroused, Kennedy told him what he had seen.\\n\\n\"Those confounded monkeys again!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Possibly, but we must be on our guard.\"\\n\\n\"Joe and I,\" said Kennedy, \"will climb down the tree by the ladder.\"\\n\\n\"And, in the meanwhile,\" added the doctor, \"I will take my measures so\\nthat we can ascend rapidly at a moment\\'s warning.\"\\n\\n\"Agreed!\"\\n\\n\"Let us go down, then!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t use your weapons, excepting at the last extremity! It would be a\\nuseless risk to make the natives aware of our presence in such a place\\nas this.\"\\n\\nDick and Joe replied with signs of assent, and then letting themselves\\nslide noiselessly toward the tree, took their position in a fork among\\nthe strong branches where the anchor had caught.\\n\\nFor some moments they listened minutely and motionlessly among the\\nfoliage, and ere long Joe seized Kenedy\\'s hand as he heard a sort of\\nrubbing sound against the bark of the tree.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you hear that?\" he whispered.\\n\\n\"Yes, and it\\'s coming nearer.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose it should be a serpent? That hissing or whistling that you\\nheard before--\"\\n\\n\"No! there was something human in it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d prefer the savages, for I have a horror of those snakes.\"\\n\\n\"The noise is increasing,\" said Kennedy, again, after a lapse of a few\\nmoments.\\n\\n\"Yes! something\\'s coming up toward us--climbing.\"\\n\\n\"Keep watch on this side, and I\\'ll take care of the other.\"\\n\\n\"Very good!\"\\n\\nThere they were, isolated at the top of one of the larger branches\\nshooting out in the midst of one of those miniature forests called\\nbaobab-trees. The darkness, heightened by the density of the foliage,\\nwas profound; however, Joe, leaning over to Kennedy\\'s ear and pointing\\ndown the tree, whispered:\\n\\n\"The blacks! They\\'re climbing toward us.\"\\n\\nThe two friends could even catch the sound of a few words uttered in the\\nlowest possible tones.\\n\\nJoe gently brought his rifle to his shoulder as he spoke.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\nSome of the natives had really climbed the baobab, and now they were\\nseen rising on all sides, winding along the boughs like reptiles, and\\nadvancing slowly but surely, all the time plainly enough discernible,\\nnot merely to the eye but to the nostrils, by the horrible odors of the\\nrancid grease with which they bedaub their bodies.\\n\\nEre long, two heads appeared to the gaze of Kennedy and Joe, on a level\\nwith the very branch to which they were clinging.\\n\\n\"Attention!\" said Kennedy. \"Fire!\"\\n\\nThe double concussion resounded like a thunderbolt and died away into\\ncries of rage and pain, and in a moment the whole horde had disappeared.\\n\\nBut, in the midst of these yells and howls, a strange, unexpected--nay\\nwhat seemed an impossible--cry had been heard! A human voice had,\\ndistinctly, called aloud in the French language--\\n\\n\"Help! help!\"\\n\\nKennedy and Joe, dumb with amazement, had regained the car immediately.\\n\\n\"Did you hear that?\" the doctor asked them.\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, that supernatural cry, \\'A moi! a moi!\\' comes from a\\nFrenchman in the hands of these barbarians!\"\\n\\n\"A traveller.\"\\n\\n\"A missionary, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Poor wretch!\" said Kennedy, \"they\\'re assassinating him--making a martyr\\nof him!\"\\n\\nThe doctor then spoke, and it was impossible for him to conceal his\\nemotions.\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt of it,\" he said; \"some unfortunate Frenchman has\\nfallen into the hands of these savages. We must not leave this place\\nwithout doing all in our power to save him. When he heard the sound\\nof our guns, he recognized an unhoped-for assistance, a providential\\ninterposition. We shall not disappoint his last hope. Are such your\\nviews?\"\\n\\n\"They are, doctor, and we are ready to obey you.\"\\n\\n\"Let us, then, lay our heads together to devise some plan, and in the\\nmorning we\\'ll try to rescue him.\"\\n\\n\"But how shall we drive off those abominable blacks?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite clear to me, from the way in which they made off, that they\\nare unacquainted with fire-arms. We must, therefore, profit by their\\nfears; but we shall await daylight before acting, and then we can form\\nour plans of rescue according to circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"The poor captive cannot be far off,\" said Joe, \"because--\"\\n\\n\"Help! help!\" repeated the voice, but much more feebly this time.\\n\\n\"The savage wretches!\" exclaimed Joe, trembling with indignation.\\n\"Suppose they should kill him to-night!\"\\n\\n\"Do you hear, doctor,\" resumed Kennedy, seizing the doctor\\'s hand.\\n\"Suppose they should kill him to-night!\"\\n\\n\"It is not at all likely, my friends. These savage tribes kill their\\ncaptives in broad daylight; they must have the sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"Now, if I were to take advantage of the darkness to slip down to the\\npoor fellow?\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll go with you,\" said Joe, warmly.\\n\\n\"Pause, my friends--pause! The suggestion does honor to your hearts\\nand to your courage; but you would expose us all to great peril, and do\\nstill greater harm to the unfortunate man whom you wish to aid.\"\\n\\n\"Why so?\" asked Kennedy. \"These savages are frightened and dispersed:\\nthey will not return.\"\\n\\n\"Dick, I implore you, heed what I say. I am acting for the common good;\\nand if by any accident you should be taken by surprise, all would be\\nlost.\"\\n\\n\"But, think of that poor wretch, hoping for aid, waiting there, praying,\\ncalling aloud. Is no one to go to his assistance? He must think that his\\nsenses deceived him; that he heard nothing!\"\\n\\n\"We can reassure him, on that score,\" said Dr. Ferguson--and, standing\\nerect, making a speaking-trumpet of his hands, he shouted at the top of\\nhis voice, in French: \"Whoever you are, be of good cheer! Three friends\\nare watching over you.\"\\n\\nA terrific howl from the savages responded to these words--no doubt\\ndrowning the prisoner\\'s reply.\\n\\n\"They are murdering him! they are murdering him!\" exclaimed Kennedy.\\n\"Our interference will have served no other purpose than to hasten the\\nhour of his doom. We must act!\"\\n\\n\"But how, Dick? What do you expect to do in the midst of this darkness?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if it was only daylight!\" sighed Joe.\\n\\n\"Well, and suppose it were daylight?\" said the doctor, in a singular\\ntone.\\n\\n\"Nothing more simple, doctor,\" said Kennedy. \"I\\'d go down and scatter\\nall these savage villains with powder and ball!\"\\n\\n\"And you, Joe, what would you do?\"\\n\\n\"I, master? why, I\\'d act more prudently, maybe, by telling the prisoner\\nto make his escape in a certain direction that we\\'d agree upon.\"\\n\\n\"And how would you get him to know that?\"\\n\\n\"By means of this arrow that I caught flying the other day. I\\'d tie a\\nnote to it, or I\\'d just call out to him in a loud voice what you want\\nhim to do, because these black fellows don\\'t understand the language\\nthat you\\'d speak in!\"\\n\\n\"Your plans are impracticable, my dear friends. The greatest difficulty\\nwould be for this poor fellow to escape at all--even admitting that he\\nshould manage to elude the vigilance of his captors. As for you, my\\ndear Dick, with determined daring, and profiting by their alarm at our\\nfire-arms, your project might possibly succeed; but, were it to fail,\\nyou would be lost, and we should have two persons to save instead\\nof one. No! we must put ALL the chances on OUR side, and go to work\\ndifferently.\"\\n\\n\"But let us act at once!\" said the hunter.\\n\\n\"Perhaps we may,\" said the doctor, throwing considerable stress upon the\\nwords.\\n\\n\"Why, doctor, can you light up such darkness as this?\"\\n\\n\"Who knows, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"Ah! if you can do that, you\\'re the greatest learned man in the world!\"\\n\\nThe doctor kept silent for a few moments; he was thinking. His two\\ncompanions looked at him with much emotion, for they were greatly\\nexcited by the strangeness of the situation. Ferguson at last resumed:\\n\\n\"Here is my plan: We have two hundred pounds of ballast left, since\\nthe bags we brought with us are still untouched. I\\'ll suppose that this\\nprisoner, who is evidently exhausted by suffering, weighs as much as one\\nof us; there will still remain sixty pounds of ballast to throw out, in\\ncase we should want to ascend suddenly.\"\\n\\n\"How do you expect to manage the balloon?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"This is the idea, Dick: you will admit that if I can get to the\\nprisoner, and throw out a quantity of ballast, equal to his weight, I\\nshall have in nowise altered the equilibrium of the balloon. But, then,\\nif I want to get a rapid ascension, so as to escape these savages,\\nI must employ means more energetic than the cylinder. Well, then, in\\nthrowing out this overplus of ballast at a given moment, I am certain to\\nrise with great rapidity.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s plain enough.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but there is one drawback: it consists in the fact that, in order\\nto descend after that, I should have to part with a quantity of gas\\nproportionate to the surplus ballast that I had thrown out. Now, the\\ngas is precious; but we must not haggle over it when the life of a\\nfellow-creature is at stake.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, sir; we must do every thing in our power to save him.\"\\n\\n\"Let us work, then, and get these bags all arranged on the rim of the\\ncar, so that they may be thrown overboard at one movement.\"\\n\\n\"But this darkness?\"\\n\\n\"It hides our preparations, and will be dispersed only when they are\\nfinished. Take care to have all our weapons close at hand. Perhaps we\\nmay have to fire; so we have one shot in the rifle; four for the two\\nmuskets; twelve in the two revolvers; or seventeen in all, which might\\nbe fired in a quarter of a minute. But perhaps we shall not have to\\nresort to all this noisy work. Are you ready?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re ready,\" responded Joe.\\n\\nThe sacks were placed as requested, and the arms were put in good order.\\n\\n\"Very good!\" said the doctor. \"Have an eye to every thing. Joe will see\\nto throwing out the ballast, and Dick will carry off the prisoner; but\\nlet nothing be done until I give the word. Joe will first detach the\\nanchor, and then quickly make his way back to the car.\"\\n\\nJoe let himself slide down by the rope; and, in a few moments,\\nreappeared at his post; while the balloon, thus liberated, hung almost\\nmotionless in the air.\\n\\nIn the mean time the doctor assured himself of the presence of a\\nsufficient quantity of gas in the mixing-tank to feed the cylinder, if\\nnecessary, without there being any need of resorting for some time\\nto the Buntzen battery. He then took out the two perfectly-isolated\\nconducting-wires, which served for the decomposition of the water, and,\\nsearching in his travelling-sack, brought forth two pieces of charcoal,\\ncut down to a sharp point, and fixed one at the end of each wire.\\n\\nHis two friends looked on, without knowing what he was about, but they\\nkept perfectly silent. When the doctor had finished, he stood up erect\\nin the car, and, taking the two pieces of charcoal, one in each hand,\\ndrew their points nearly together.\\n\\nIn a twinkling, an intense and dazzling light was produced, with an\\ninsupportable glow between the two pointed ends of charcoal, and a huge\\njet of electric radiance literally broke the darkness of the night.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated the astonished friends.\\n\\n\"Not a word!\" cautioned the doctor.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.\\n\\nThe Jet of Light.--The Missionary.--The Rescue in a Ray of\\nElectricity.--A Lazarist Priest.--But little Hope.--The Doctor\\'s\\nCare.--A Life of Self-Denial.--Passing a Volcano.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson darted his powerful electric jet toward various points of\\nspace, and caused it to rest on a spot from which shouts of terror were\\nheard. His companions fixed their gaze eagerly on the place.\\n\\nThe baobab, over which the balloon was hanging almost motionless, stood\\nin the centre of a clearing, where, between fields of Indian-corn and\\nsugar-cane, were seen some fifty low, conical huts, around which swarmed\\na numerous tribe.\\n\\nA hundred feet below the balloon stood a large post, or stake, and at\\nits foot lay a human being--a young man of thirty years or more, with\\nlong black hair, half naked, wasted and wan, bleeding, covered with\\nwounds, his head bowed over upon his breast, as Christ\\'s was, when He\\nhung upon the cross.\\n\\nThe hair, cut shorter on the top of his skull, still indicated the place\\nof a half-effaced tonsure.\\n\\n\"A missionary! a priest!\" exclaimed Joe.\\n\\n\"Poor, unfortunate man!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"We must save him, Dick!\" responded the doctor; \"we must save him!\"\\n\\nThe crowd of blacks, when they saw the balloon over their heads, like\\na huge comet with a train of dazzling light, were seized with a terror\\nthat may be readily imagined. Upon hearing their cries, the prisoner\\nraised his head. His eyes gleamed with sudden hope, and, without too\\nthoroughly comprehending what was taking place, he stretched out his\\nhands to his unexpected deliverers.\\n\\n\"He is alive!\" exclaimed Ferguson. \"God be praised! The savages have got\\na fine scare, and we shall save him! Are you ready, friends?\"\\n\\n\"Ready, doctor, at the word.\"\\n\\n\"Joe, shut off the cylinder!\"\\n\\nThe doctor\\'s order was executed. An almost imperceptible breath of air\\nimpelled the balloon directly over the prisoner, at the same time that\\nit gently lowered with the contraction of the gas. For about ten minutes\\nit remained floating in the midst of luminous waves, for Ferguson\\ncontinued to flash right down upon the throng his glowing sheaf of rays,\\nwhich, here and there, marked out swift and vivid sheets of light.\\nThe tribe, under the influence of an indescribable terror, disappeared\\nlittle by little in the huts, and there was complete solitude around\\nthe stake. The doctor had, therefore, been right in counting upon the\\nfantastic appearance of the balloon throwing out rays, as vivid as the\\nsun\\'s, through this intense gloom.\\n\\nThe car was approaching the ground; but a few of the savages, more\\naudacious than the rest, guessing that their victim was about to escape\\nfrom their clutches, came back with loud yells, and Kennedy seized his\\nrifle. The doctor, however, besought him not to fire.\\n\\nThe priest, on his knees, for he had not the strength to stand erect,\\nwas not even fastened to the stake, his weakness rendering that\\nprecaution superfluous. At the instant when the car was close to the\\nground, the brawny Scot, laying aside his rifle, and seizing the priest\\naround the waist, lifted him into the car, while, at the same moment,\\nJoe tossed over the two hundred pounds of ballast.\\n\\nThe doctor had expected to ascend rapidly, but, contrary to his\\ncalculations, the balloon, after going up some three or four feet,\\nremained there perfectly motionless.\\n\\n\"What holds us?\" he asked, with an accent of terror.\\n\\nSome of the savages were running toward them, uttering ferocious cries.\\n\\n\"Ah, ha!\" said Joe, \"one of those cursed blacks is hanging to the car!\"\\n\\n\"Dick! Dick!\" cried the doctor, \"the water-tank!\"\\n\\nKennedy caught his friend\\'s idea on the instant, and, snatching up with\\ndesperate strength one of the water-tanks weighing about one hundred\\npounds, he tossed it overboard. The balloon, thus suddenly lightened,\\nmade a leap of three hundred feet into the air, amid the howlings of the\\ntribe whose prisoner thus escaped them in a blaze of dazzling light.\\n\\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted the doctor\\'s comrades.\\n\\nSuddenly, the balloon took a fresh leap, which carried it up to an\\nelevation of a thousand feet.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Kennedy, who had nearly lost his balance.\\n\\n\"Oh! nothing; only that black villain leaving us!\" replied the doctor,\\ntranquilly, and Joe, leaning over, saw the savage that had clung to the\\ncar whirling over and over, with his arms outstretched in the air, and\\npresently dashed to pieces on the ground. The doctor then separated his\\nelectric wires, and every thing was again buried in profound obscurity.\\nIt was now one o\\'clock in the morning.\\n\\nThe Frenchman, who had swooned away, at length opened his eyes.\\n\\n\"You are saved!\" were the doctor\\'s first words.\\n\\n\"Saved!\" he with a sad smile replied in English, \"saved from a cruel\\ndeath! My brethren, I thank you, but my days are numbered, nay, even my\\nhours, and I have but little longer to live.\"\\n\\nWith this, the missionary, again yielding to exhaustion, relapsed into\\nhis fainting-fit.\\n\\n\"He is dying!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the doctor, bending over him, \"but he is very weak; so let\\nus lay him under the awning.\"\\n\\nAnd they did gently deposit on their blankets that poor, wasted body,\\ncovered with scars and wounds, still bleeding where fire and steel had,\\nin twenty places, left their agonizing marks. The doctor, taking an old\\nhandkerchief, quickly prepared a little lint, which he spread over the\\nwounds, after having washed them. These rapid attentions were bestowed\\nwith the celerity and skill of a practised surgeon, and, when they were\\ncomplete, the doctor, taking a cordial from his medicine-chest, poured a\\nfew drops upon his patient\\'s lips.\\n\\nThe latter feebly pressed his kind hands, and scarcely had the strength\\nto say, \"Thank you! thank you!\"\\n\\nThe doctor comprehended that he must be left perfectly quiet; so he\\nclosed the folds of the awning and resumed the guidance of the balloon.\\n\\nThe latter, after taking into account the weight of the new passenger,\\nhad been lightened of one hundred and eighty pounds, and therefore\\nkept aloft without the aid of the cylinder. At the first dawn of day,\\na current drove it gently toward the west-northwest. The doctor went\\nin under the awning for a moment or two, to look at his still sleeping\\npatient.\\n\\n\"May Heaven spare the life of our new companion! Have you any hope?\"\\nsaid the Scot.\\n\\n\"Yes, Dick, with care, in this pure, fresh atmosphere.\"\\n\\n\"How that man has suffered!\" said Joe, with feeling. \"He did bolder\\nthings than we\\'ve done, in venturing all alone among those savage\\ntribes!\"\\n\\n\"That cannot be questioned,\" assented the hunter.\\n\\nDuring the entire day the doctor would not allow the sleep of his\\npatient to be disturbed. It was really a long stupor, broken only by\\nan occasional murmur of pain that continued to disquiet and agitate the\\ndoctor greatly.\\n\\nToward evening the balloon remained stationary in the midst of the\\ngloom, and during the night, while Kennedy and Joe relieved each other\\nin carefully tending the sick man, Ferguson kept watch over the safety\\nof all.\\n\\nBy the morning of the next day, the balloon had moved, but very\\nslightly, to the westward. The dawn came up pure and magnificent. The\\nsick man was able to call his friends with a stronger voice. They raised\\nthe curtains of the awning, and he inhaled with delight the keen morning\\nair.\\n\\n\"How do you feel to-day?\" asked the doctor.\\n\\n\"Better, perhaps,\" he replied. \"But you, my friends, I have not seen\\nyou yet, excepting in a dream! I can, indeed, scarcely recall what has\\noccurred. Who are you--that your names may not be forgotten in my dying\\nprayers?\"\\n\\n\"We are English travellers,\" replied Ferguson. \"We are trying to cross\\nAfrica in a balloon, and, on our way, we have had the good fortune to\\nrescue you.\"\\n\\n\"Science has its heroes,\" said the missionary.\\n\\n\"But religion its martyrs!\" rejoined the Scot.\\n\\n\"Are you a missionary?\" asked the doctor.\\n\\n\"I am a priest of the Lazarist mission. Heaven sent you to me--Heaven\\nbe praised! The sacrifice of my life had been accomplished! But you come\\nfrom Europe; tell me about Europe, about France! I have been without\\nnews for the last five years!\"\\n\\n\"Five years! alone! and among these savages!\" exclaimed Kennedy with\\namazement.\\n\\n\"They are souls to redeem! ignorant and barbarous brethren, whom\\nreligion alone can instruct and civilize.\"\\n\\nDr. Ferguson, yielding to the priest\\'s request, talked to him long and\\nfully about France. He listened eagerly, and his eyes filled with tears.\\nHe seized Kennedy\\'s and Joe\\'s hands by turns in his own, which were\\nburning with fever. The doctor prepared him some tea, and he drank it\\nwith satisfaction. After that, he had strength enough to raise himself\\nup a little, and smiled with pleasure at seeing himself borne along\\nthrough so pure a sky.\\n\\n\"You are daring travellers!\" he said, \"and you will succeed in your bold\\nenterprise. You will again behold your relatives, your friends, your\\ncountry--you--\"\\n\\nAt this moment, the weakness of the young missionary became so extreme\\nthat they had to lay him again on the bed, where a prostration, lasting\\nfor several hours, held him like a dead man under the eye of Dr.\\nFerguson. The latter could not suppress his emotion, for he felt that\\nthis life now in his charge was ebbing away. Were they then so soon\\nto lose him whom they had snatched from an agonizing death? The doctor\\nagain washed and dressed the young martyr\\'s frightful wounds, and had to\\nsacrifice nearly his whole stock of water to refresh his burning limbs.\\nHe surrounded him with the tenderest and most intelligent care, until,\\nat length, the sick man revived, little by little, in his arms, and\\nrecovered his consciousness if not his strength.\\n\\nThe doctor was able to gather something of his history from his broken\\nmurmurs.\\n\\n\"Speak in your native language,\" he said to the sufferer; \"I understand\\nit, and it will fatigue you less.\"\\n\\nThe missionary was a poor young man from the village of Aradon, in\\nBrittany, in the Morbihan country. His earliest instincts had drawn him\\ntoward an ecclesiastical career, but to this life of self-sacrifice he\\nwas also desirous of joining a life of danger, by entering the mission\\nof the order of priesthood of which St. Vincent de Paul was the founder,\\nand, at twenty, he quitted his country for the inhospitable shores of\\nAfrica. From the sea-coast, overcoming obstacles, little by little,\\nbraving all privations, pushing onward, afoot, and praying, he had\\nadvanced to the very centre of those tribes that dwell among the\\ntributary streams of the Upper Nile. For two years his faith was\\nspurned, his zeal denied recognition, his charities taken in ill\\npart, and he remained a prisoner to one of the cruelest tribes of the\\nNyambarra, the object of every species of maltreatment. But still\\nhe went on teaching, instructing, and praying. The tribe having been\\ndispersed and he left for dead, in one of those combats which are\\nso frequent between the tribes, instead of retracing his steps, he\\npersisted in his evangelical mission. His most tranquil time was when he\\nwas taken for a madman. Meanwhile, he had made himself familiar with the\\nidioms of the country, and he catechised in them. At length, during two\\nmore long years, he traversed these barbarous regions, impelled by\\nthat superhuman energy that comes from God. For a year past he had been\\nresiding with that tribe of the Nyam-Nyams known as the Barafri, one of\\nthe wildest and most ferocious of them all. The chief having died a few\\ndays before our travellers appeared, his sudden death was attributed to\\nthe missionary, and the tribe resolved to immolate him. His sufferings\\nhad already continued for the space of forty hours, and, as the doctor\\nhad supposed, he was to have perished in the blaze of the noonday sun.\\nWhen he heard the sound of fire-arms, nature got the best of him, and\\nhe had cried out, \"Help! help!\" He then thought that he must have been\\ndreaming, when a voice, that seemed to come from the sky, had uttered\\nwords of consolation.\\n\\n\"I have no regrets,\" he said, \"for the life that is passing away from\\nme; my life belongs to God!\"\\n\\n\"Hope still!\" said the doctor; \"we are near you, and we will save you\\nnow, as we saved you from the tortures of the stake.\"\\n\\n\"I do not ask so much of Heaven,\" said the priest, with resignation.\\n\"Blessed be God for having vouchsafed to me the joy before I die of\\nhaving pressed your friendly hands, and having heard, once more, the\\nlanguage of my country!\"\\n\\nThe missionary here grew weak again, and the whole day went by between\\nhope and fear, Kennedy deeply moved, and Joe drawing his hand over his\\neyes more than once when he thought that no one saw him.\\n\\nThe balloon made little progress, and the wind seemed as though\\nunwilling to jostle its precious burden.\\n\\nToward evening, Joe discovered a great light in the west. Under more\\nelevated latitudes, it might have been mistaken for an immense aurora\\nborealis, for the sky appeared on fire. The doctor very attentively\\nexamined the phenomenon.\\n\\n\"It is, perhaps, only a volcano in full activity,\" said he.\\n\\n\"But the wind is carrying us directly over it,\" replied Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Very well, we shall cross it then at a safe height!\" said the doctor.\\n\\nThree hours later, the Victoria was right among the mountains. Her exact\\nposition was twenty-four degrees fifteen minutes east longitude,\\nand four degrees forty-two minutes north latitude, and four degrees\\nforty-two minutes north latitude. In front of her a volcanic crater was\\npouring forth torrents of melted lava, and hurling masses of rock to an\\nenormous height. There were jets, too, of liquid fire that fell back in\\ndazzling cascades--a superb but dangerous spectacle, for the wind with\\nunswerving certainty was carrying the balloon directly toward this\\nblazing atmosphere.\\n\\nThis obstacle, which could not be turned, had to be crossed, so the\\ncylinder was put to its utmost power, and the balloon rose to the height\\nof six thousand feet, leaving between it and the volcano a space of more\\nthan three hundred fathoms.\\n\\nFrom his bed of suffering, the dying missionary could contemplate that\\nfiery crater from which a thousand jets of dazzling flame were that\\nmoment escaping.\\n\\n\"How grand it is!\" said he, \"and how infinite is the power of God even\\nin its most terrible manifestations!\"\\n\\nThis overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a\\nveritable drapery of flame; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly\\nin the upper night; a torrid heat ascended to the car, and Dr. Ferguson\\nmade all possible haste to escape from this perilous situation.\\n\\nBy ten o\\'clock the volcano could be seen only as a red point on the\\nhorizon, and the balloon tranquilly pursued her course in a less\\nelevated zone of the atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.\\n\\nJoe in a Fit of Rage.--The Death of a Good Man.--The Night of watching\\nby the Body.--Barrenness and Drought.--The Burial.--The Quartz\\nRocks.--Joe\\'s Hallucinations.--A Precious Ballast.--A Survey of the\\nGold-bearing Mountains.--The Beginning of Joe\\'s Despair.\\n\\nA magnificent night overspread the earth, and the missionary lay quietly\\nasleep in utter exhaustion.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll not get over it!\" sighed Joe. \"Poor young fellow--scarcely thirty\\nyears of age!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll die in our arms. His breathing, which was so feeble before,\\nis growing weaker still, and I can do nothing to save him,\" said the\\ndoctor, despairingly.\\n\\n\"The infamous scoundrels!\" exclaimed Joe, grinding his teeth, in one of\\nthose fits of rage that came over him at long intervals; \"and to think\\nthat, in spite of all, this good man could find words only to pity them,\\nto excuse, to pardon them!\"\\n\\n\"Heaven has given him a lovely night, Joe--his last on earth, perhaps!\\nHe will suffer but little more after this, and his dying will be only a\\npeaceful falling asleep.\"\\n\\nThe dying man uttered some broken words, and the doctor at once went to\\nhim. His breathing became difficult, and he asked for air. The curtains\\nwere drawn entirely back, and he inhaled with rapture the light breezes\\nof that clear, beautiful night. The stars sent him their trembling rays,\\nand the moon wrapped him in the white winding-sheet of its effulgence.\\n\\n\"My friends,\" said he, in an enfeebled voice, \"I am going. May God\\nrequite you, and bring you to your safe harbor! May he pay for me the\\ndebt of gratitude that I owe to you!\"\\n\\n\"You must still hope,\" replied Kennedy. \"This is but a passing fit of\\nweakness. You will not die. How could any one die on this beautiful\\nsummer night?\"\\n\\n\"Death is at hand,\" replied the missionary, \"I know it! Let me look it\\nin the face! Death, the commencement of things eternal, is but the end\\nof earthly cares. Place me upon my knees, my brethren, I beseech you!\"\\n\\nKennedy lifted him up, and it was distressing to see his weakened limbs\\nbend under him.\\n\\n\"My God! my God!\" exclaimed the dying apostle, \"have pity on me!\"\\n\\nHis countenance shone. Far above that earth on which he had known no\\njoys; in the midst of that night which sent to him its softest radiance;\\non the way to that heaven toward which he uplifted his spirit, as though\\nin a miraculous assumption, he seemed already to live and breathe in the\\nnew existence.\\n\\nHis last gesture was a supreme blessing on his new friends of only one\\nday. Then he fell back into the arms of Kennedy, whose countenance was\\nbathed in hot tears.\\n\\n\"Dead!\" said the doctor, bending over him, \"dead!\" And with one common\\naccord, the three friends knelt together in silent prayer.\\n\\n\"To-morrow,\" resumed the doctor, \"we shall bury him in the African soil\\nwhich he has besprinkled with his blood.\"\\n\\nDuring the rest of the night the body was watched, turn by turn, by the\\nthree travellers, and not a word disturbed the solemn silence. Each of\\nthem was weeping.\\n\\nThe next day the wind came from the south, and the balloon moved slowly\\nover a vast plateau of mountains: there, were extinct craters; here,\\nbarren ravines; not a drop of water on those parched crests; piles\\nof broken rocks; huge stony masses scattered hither and thither,\\nand, interspersed with whitish marl, all indicated the most complete\\nsterility.\\n\\nToward noon, the doctor, for the purpose of burying the body, decided to\\ndescend into a ravine, in the midst of some plutonic rocks of primitive\\nformation. The surrounding mountains would shelter him, and enable him\\nto bring his car to the ground, for there was no tree in sight to which\\nhe could make it fast.\\n\\nBut, as he had explained to Kennedy, it was now impossible for him to\\ndescend, except by releasing a quantity of gas proportionate to his loss\\nof ballast at the time when he had rescued the missionary. He therefore\\nopened the valve of the outside balloon. The hydrogen escaped, and the\\nVictoria quietly descended into the ravine.\\n\\nAs soon as the car touched the ground, the doctor shut the valve. Joe\\nleaped out, holding on the while to the rim of the car with one hand,\\nand with the other gathering up a quantity of stones equal to his own\\nweight. He could then use both hands, and had soon heaped into the car\\nmore than five hundred pounds of stones, which enabled both the doctor\\nand Kennedy, in their turn, to get out. Thus the Victoria found herself\\nbalanced, and her ascensional force insufficient to raise her.\\n\\nMoreover, it was not necessary to gather many of these stones, for\\nthe blocks were extremely heavy, so much so, indeed, that the doctor\\'s\\nattention was attracted by the circumstance. The soil, in fact, was\\nbestrewn with quartz and porphyritic rocks.\\n\\n\"This is a singular discovery!\" said the doctor, mentally.\\n\\nIn the mean while, Kennedy and Joe had strolled away a few paces,\\nlooking up a proper spot for the grave. The heat was extreme in this\\nravine, shut in as it was like a sort of furnace. The noonday sun poured\\ndown its rays perpendicularly into it.\\n\\nThe first thing to be done was to clear the surface of the fragments of\\nrock that encumbered it, and then a quite deep grave had to be dug, so\\nthat the wild animals should not be able to disinter the corpse.\\n\\nThe body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it. The\\nearth was thrown in over his remains, and above it masses of rock were\\ndeposited, in rude resemblance to a tomb.\\n\\nThe doctor, however, remained motionless, and lost in his reflections.\\nHe did not even heed the call of his companions, nor did he return with\\nthem to seek a shelter from the heat of the day.\\n\\n\"What are you thinking about, doctor?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"About a singular freak of Nature, a curious effect of chance. Do you\\nknow, now, in what kind of soil that man of self-denial, that poor one\\nin spirit, has just been buried?\"\\n\\n\"No! what do you mean, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"That priest, who took the oath of perpetual poverty, now reposes in a\\ngold-mine!\"\\n\\n\"A gold-mine!\" exclaimed Kennedy and Joe in one breath.\\n\\n\"Yes, a gold-mine,\" said the doctor, quietly. \"Those blocks which you\\nare trampling under foot, like worthless stones, contain gold-ore of\\ngreat purity.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! impossible!\" repeated Joe.\\n\\n\"You would not have to look long among those fissures of slaty schist\\nwithout finding peptites of considerable value.\"\\n\\nJoe at once rushed like a crazy man among the scattered fragments, and\\nKennedy was not long in following his example.\\n\\n\"Keep cool, Joe,\" said his master.\\n\\n\"Why, doctor, you speak of the thing quite at your ease.\"\\n\\n\"What! a philosopher of your mettle--\"\\n\\n\"Ah, master, no philosophy holds good in this case!\"\\n\\n\"Come! come! Let us reflect a little. What good would all this wealth do\\nyou? We cannot carry any of it away with us.\"\\n\\n\"We can\\'t take any of it with us, indeed?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s rather too heavy for our car! I even hesitated to tell you any\\nthing about it, for fear of exciting your regret!\"\\n\\n\"What!\" said Joe, again, \"abandon these treasures--a fortune for\\nus!--really for us--our own--leave it behind!\"\\n\\n\"Take care, my friend! Would you yield to the thirst for gold? Has not\\nthis dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity\\nof human affairs?\"\\n\\n\"All that is true,\" replied Joe, \"but gold! Mr. Kennedy, won\\'t you help\\nto gather up a trifle of all these millions?\"\\n\\n\"What could we do with them, Joe?\" said the hunter, unable to repress a\\nsmile. \"We did not come hither in search of fortune, and we cannot take\\none home with us.\"\\n\\n\"The millions are rather heavy, you know,\" resumed the doctor, \"and\\ncannot very easily be put into one\\'s pocket.\"\\n\\n\"But, at least,\" said Joe, driven to his last defences, \"couldn\\'t we\\ntake some of that ore for ballast, instead of sand?\"\\n\\n\"Very good! I consent,\" said the doctor, \"but you must not make too\\nmany wry faces when we come to throw some thousands of crowns\\' worth\\noverboard.\"\\n\\n\"Thousands of crowns!\" echoed Joe; \"is it possible that there is so much\\ngold in them, and that all this is the same?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my friend, this is a reservoir in which Nature has been heaping up\\nher wealth for centuries! There is enough here to enrich whole nations!\\nAn Australia and a California both together in the midst of the\\nwilderness!\"\\n\\n\"And the whole of it is to remain useless!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps! but at all events, here\\'s what I\\'ll do to console you.\"\\n\\n\"That would be rather difficult to do!\" said Joe, with a contrite air.\\n\\n\"Listen! I will take the exact bearings of this spot, and give them to\\nyou, so that, upon your return to England, you can tell our countrymen\\nabout it, and let them have a share, if you think that so much gold\\nwould make them happy.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! master, I give up; I see that you are right, and that there is\\nnothing else to be done. Let us fill our car with the precious mineral,\\nand what remains at the end of the trip will be so much made.\"\\n\\nAnd Joe went to work. He did so, too, with all his might, and soon had\\ncollected more than a thousand pieces of quartz, which contained gold\\nenclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket.\\n\\nThe doctor watched him with a smile; and, while Joe went on, he took\\nthe bearings, and found that the missionary\\'s grave lay in twenty-two\\ndegrees twenty-three minutes east longitude, and four degrees fifty-five\\nminutes north latitude.\\n\\nThen, casting one glance at the swelling of the soil, beneath which the\\nbody of the poor Frenchman reposed, he went back to his car.\\n\\nHe would have erected a plain, rude cross over the tomb, left solitary\\nthus in the midst of the African deserts, but not a tree was to be seen\\nin the environs.\\n\\n\"God will recognize it!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\nAn anxiety of another sort now began to steal over the doctor\\'s mind. He\\nwould have given much of the gold before him for a little water--for he\\nhad to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried\\nup into the air. But it was impossible to find it in these arid regions;\\nand this reflection gave him great uneasiness. He had to feed his\\ncylinder continually; and he even began to find that he had not enough\\nto quench the thirst of his party. Therefore he determined to lose no\\nopportunity of replenishing his supply.\\n\\nUpon getting back to the car, he found it burdened with the\\nquartz-blocks that Joe\\'s greed had heaped in it. He got in, however,\\nwithout saying any thing. Kennedy took his customary place, and Joe\\nfollowed, but not without casting a covetous glance at the treasures in\\nthe ravine.\\n\\nThe doctor rekindled the light in the cylinder; the spiral became\\nheated; the current of hydrogen came in a few minutes, and the gas\\ndilated; but the balloon did not stir an inch.\\n\\nJoe looked on uneasily, but kept silent.\\n\\n\"Joe!\" said the doctor.\\n\\nJoe made no reply.\\n\\n\"Joe! Don\\'t you hear me?\"\\n\\nJoe made a sign that he heard; but he would not understand.\\n\\n\"Do me the kindness to throw out some of that quartz!\"\\n\\n\"But, doctor, you gave me leave--\"\\n\\n\"I gave you leave to replace the ballast; that was all!\"\\n\\n\"But--\"\\n\\n\"Do you want to stay forever in this desert?\"\\n\\nJoe cast a despairing look at Kennedy; but the hunter put on the air of\\na man who could do nothing in the matter.\\n\\n\"Well, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"Then your cylinder don\\'t work,\" said the obstinate fellow.\\n\\n\"My cylinder? It is lit, as you perceive. But the balloon will not rise\\nuntil you have thrown off a little ballast.\"\\n\\nJoe scratched his ear, picked up a piece of quartz, the smallest in the\\nlot, weighed and reweighed it, and tossed it up and down in his hand. It\\nwas a fragment of about three or four pounds. At last he threw it out.\\n\\nBut the balloon did not budge.\\n\\n\"Humph!\" said he; \"we\\'re not going up yet.\"\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" said the doctor. \"Keep on throwing.\"\\n\\nKennedy laughed. Joe now threw out some ten pounds, but the balloon\\nstood still.\\n\\nJoe got very pale.\\n\\n\"Poor fellow!\" said the doctor. \"Mr. Kennedy, you and I weigh, unless I\\nam mistaken, about four hundred pounds--so that you\\'ll have to get rid\\nof at least that weight, since it was put in here to make up for us.\"\\n\\n\"Throw away four hundred pounds!\" said Joe, piteously.\\n\\n\"And some more with it, or we can\\'t rise. Come, courage, Joe!\"\\n\\nThe brave fellow, heaving deep sighs, began at last to lighten the\\nballoon; but, from time to time, he would stop, and ask:\\n\\n\"Are you going up?\"\\n\\n\"No, not yet,\" was the invariable response.\\n\\n\"It moves!\" said he, at last.\\n\\n\"Keep on!\" replied the doctor.\\n\\n\"It\\'s going up; I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\"Keep on yet,\" said Kennedy.\\n\\nAnd Joe, picking up one more block, desperately tossed it out of the\\ncar. The balloon rose a hundred feet or so, and, aided by the cylinder,\\nsoon passed above the surrounding summits.\\n\\n\"Now, Joe,\" resumed the doctor, \"there still remains a handsome fortune\\nfor you; and, if we can only keep the rest of this with us until the end\\nof our trip, there you are--rich for the balance of your days!\"\\n\\nJoe made no answer, but stretched himself out luxuriously on his heap of\\nquartz.\\n\\n\"See, my dear Dick!\" the doctor went on. \"Just see the power of this\\nmetal over the cleverest lad in the world! What passions, what greed,\\nwhat crimes, the knowledge of such a mine as that would cause! It is sad\\nto think of it!\"\\n\\nBy evening the balloon had made ninety miles to the westward, and was,\\nin a direct line, fourteen hundred miles from Zanzibar.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.\\n\\nThe Wind dies away.--The Vicinity of the Desert.--The Mistake in\\nthe Water-Supply.--The Nights of the Equator.--Dr. Ferguson\\'s\\nAnxieties.--The Situation flatly stated.--Energetic Replies of Kennedy\\nand Joe.--One Night more.\\n\\nThe balloon, having been made fast to a solitary tree, almost completely\\ndried up by the aridity of the region in which it stood, passed the\\nnight in perfect quietness; and the travellers were enabled to enjoy a\\nlittle of the repose which they so greatly needed. The emotions of the\\nday had left sad impressions on their minds.\\n\\nToward morning, the sky had resumed its brilliant purity and its heat.\\nThe balloon ascended, and, after several ineffectual attempts, fell into\\na current that, although not rapid, bore them toward the northwest.\\n\\n\"We are not making progress,\" said the doctor. \"If I am not mistaken,\\nwe have accomplished nearly half of our journey in ten days; but, at the\\nrate at which we are going, it would take months to end it; and that is\\nall the more vexatious, that we are threatened with a lack of water.\"\\n\\n\"But we\\'ll find some,\" said Joe. \"It is not to be thought of that we\\nshouldn\\'t discover some river, some stream, or pond, in all this vast\\nextent of country.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so.\"\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t you think that it\\'s Joe\\'s cargo of stone that is keeping us\\nback?\"\\n\\nKennedy asked this question only to tease Joe; and he did so the\\nmore willingly because he had, for a moment, shared the poor lad\\'s\\nhallucinations; but, not finding any thing in them, he had fallen back\\ninto the attitude of a strong-minded looker-on, and turned the affair\\noff with a laugh.\\n\\nJoe cast a mournful glance at him; but the doctor made no reply. He was\\nthinking, not without secret terror, probably, of the vast solitudes\\nof Sahara--for there whole weeks sometimes pass without the caravans\\nmeeting with a single spring of water. Occupied with these thoughts, he\\nscrutinized every depression of the soil with the closest attention.\\n\\nThese anxieties, and the incidents recently occurring, had not been\\nwithout their effect upon the spirits of our three travellers. They\\nconversed less, and were more wrapt in their own thoughts.\\n\\nJoe, clever lad as he was, seemed no longer the same person since his\\ngaze had plunged into that ocean of gold. He kept entirely silent,\\nand gazed incessantly upon the stony fragments heaped up in the\\ncar--worthless to-day, but of inestimable value to-morrow.\\n\\nThe appearance of this part of Africa was, moreover, quite calculated\\nto inspire alarm: the desert was gradually expanding around them; not\\nanother village was to be seen--not even a collection of a few huts; and\\nvegetation also was disappearing. Barely a few dwarf plants could now be\\nnoticed, like those on the wild heaths of Scotland; then came the first\\ntract of grayish sand and flint, with here and there a lentisk tree and\\nbrambles. In the midst of this sterility, the rudimental carcass of the\\nGlobe appeared in ridges of sharply-jutting rock. These symptoms of a\\ntotally dry and barren region greatly disquieted Dr. Ferguson.\\n\\nIt seemed as though no caravan had ever braved this desert expanse, or\\nit would have left visible traces of its encampments, or the whitened\\nbones of men and animals. But nothing of the kind was to be seen, and\\nthe aeronauts felt that, ere long, an immensity of sand would cover the\\nwhole of this desolate region.\\n\\nHowever, there was no going back; they must go forward; and, indeed, the\\ndoctor asked for nothing better; he would even have welcomed a tempest\\nto carry him beyond this country. But, there was not a cloud in the sky.\\nAt the close of the day, the balloon had not made thirty miles.\\n\\nIf there had been no lack of water! But, there remained only three\\ngallons in all! The doctor put aside one gallon, destined to quench the\\nburning thirst that a heat of ninety degrees rendered intolerable. Two\\ngallons only then remained to supply the cylinder. Hence, they could\\nproduce no more than four hundred and eighty cubic feet of gas; yet the\\ncylinder consumed about nine cubic feet per hour. Consequently, they\\ncould not keep on longer than fifty-four hours--and all this was a\\nmathematical calculation!\\n\\n\"Fifty-four hours!\" said the doctor to his companions. \"Therefore, as I\\nam determined not to travel by night, for fear of passing some stream\\nor pool, we have but three days and a half of journeying during which we\\nmust find water, at all hazards. I have thought it my duty to make you\\naware of the real state of the case, as I have retained only one\\ngallon for drinking, and we shall have to put ourselves on the shortest\\nallowance.\"\\n\\n\"Put us on short allowance, then, doctor,\" responded Kennedy, \"but we\\nmust not despair. We have three days left, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear Dick!\"\\n\\n\"Well, as grieving over the matter won\\'t help us, in three days there\\nwill be time enough to decide upon what is to be done; in the meanwhile,\\nlet us redouble our vigilance!\"\\n\\nAt their evening meal, the water was strictly measured out, and the\\nbrandy was increased in quantity in the punch they drank. But they had\\nto be careful with the spirits, the latter being more likely to produce\\nthan to quench thirst.\\n\\nThe car rested, during the night, upon an immense plateau, in which\\nthere was a deep hollow; its height was scarcely eight hundred feet\\nabove the level of the sea. This circumstance gave the doctor some hope,\\nsince it recalled to his mind the conjectures of geographers concerning\\nthe existence of a vast stretch of water in the centre of Africa. But,\\nif such a lake really existed, the point was to reach it, and not a sign\\nof change was visible in the motionless sky.\\n\\nTo the tranquil night and its starry magnificence succeeded the\\nunchanging daylight and the blazing rays of the sun; and, from the\\nearliest dawn, the temperature became scorching. At five o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, the doctor gave the signal for departure, and, for\\na considerable time, the balloon remained immovable in the leaden\\natmosphere.\\n\\nThe doctor might have escaped this intense heat by rising into a higher\\nrange, but, in order to do so, he would have had to consume a large\\nquantity of water, a thing that had now become impossible. He contented\\nhimself, therefore, with keeping the balloon at one hundred feet from\\nthe ground, and, at that elevation, a feeble current drove it toward the\\nwestern horizon.\\n\\nThe breakfast consisted of a little dried meat and pemmican. By noon,\\nthe Victoria had advanced only a few miles.\\n\\n\"We cannot go any faster,\" said the doctor; \"we no longer command--we\\nhave to obey.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! doctor, here is one of those occasions when a propeller would not\\nbe a thing to be despised.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly so, Dick, provided it would not require an expenditure of\\nwater to put it in motion, for, in that case, the situation would be\\nprecisely the same; moreover, up to this time, nothing practical of the\\nsort has been invented. Balloons are still at that point where ships\\nwere before the invention of steam. It took six thousand years to invent\\npropellers and screws; so we have time enough yet.\"\\n\\n\"Confounded heat!\" said Joe, wiping away the perspiration that was\\nstreaming from his forehead.\\n\\n\"If we had water, this heat would be of service to us, for it dilates\\nthe hydrogen in the balloon, and diminishes the amount required in the\\nspiral, although it is true that, if we were not short of the useful\\nliquid, we should not have to economize it. Ah! that rascally savage who\\ncost us the tank!\"*\\n\\n     * The water-tank had been thrown overboard when the native\\n     clung to the car.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t regret, though, what you did, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"No, Dick, since it was in our power to save that unfortunate missionary\\nfrom a horrible death. But, the hundred pounds of water that we threw\\noverboard would be very useful to us now; it would be thirteen or\\nfourteen days more of progress secured, or quite enough to carry us over\\nthis desert.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve made at least half the journey, haven\\'t we?\" asked Joe.\\n\\n\"In distance, yes; but in duration, no, should the wind leave us; and\\nit, even now, has a tendency to die away altogether.\"\\n\\n\"Come, sir,\" said Joe, again, \"we must not complain; we\\'ve got\\nalong pretty well, thus far, and whatever happens to me, I can\\'t get\\ndesperate. We\\'ll find water; mind, I tell you so.\"\\n\\nThe soil, however, ran lower from mile to mile; the undulations of the\\ngold-bearing mountains they had left died away into the plain, like the\\nlast throes of exhausted Nature. Scanty grass took the place of the\\nfine trees of the east; only a few belts of half-scorched herbage still\\ncontended against the invasion of the sand, and the huge rocks, that\\nhad rolled down from the distant summits, crushed in their fall, had\\nscattered in sharp-edged pebbles which soon again became coarse sand,\\nand finally impalpable dust.\\n\\n\"Here, at last, is Africa, such as you pictured it to yourself, Joe! Was\\nI not right in saying, \\'Wait a little?\\' eh?\"\\n\\n\"Well, master, it\\'s all natural, at least--heat and dust. It would be\\nfoolish to look for any thing else in such a country. Do you see,\" he\\nadded, laughing, \"I had no confidence, for my part, in your forests and\\nyour prairies; they were out of reason. What was the use of coming so\\nfar to find scenery just like England? Here\\'s the first time that I\\nbelieve in Africa, and I\\'m not sorry to get a taste of it.\"\\n\\nToward evening, the doctor calculated that the balloon had not made\\ntwenty miles during that whole burning day, and a heated gloom closed\\nin upon it, as soon as the sun had disappeared behind the horizon, which\\nwas traced against the sky with all the precision of a straight line.\\n\\nThe next day was Thursday, the 1st of May, but the days followed each\\nother with desperate monotony. Each morning was like the one that had\\npreceded it; noon poured down the same exhaustless rays, and night\\ncondensed in its shadow the scattered heat which the ensuing day\\nwould again bequeath to the succeeding night. The wind, now scarcely\\nobservable, was rather a gasp than a breath, and the morning could\\nalmost be foreseen when even that gasp would cease.\\n\\nThe doctor reacted against the gloominess of the situation and retained\\nall the coolness and self-possession of a disciplined heart. With his\\nglass he scrutinized every quarter of the horizon; he saw the last\\nrising ground gradually melting to the dead level, and the last\\nvegetation disappearing, while, before him, stretched the immensity of\\nthe desert.\\n\\nThe responsibility resting upon him pressed sorely, but he did not allow\\nhis disquiet to appear. Those two men, Dick and Joe, friends of his,\\nboth of them, he had induced to come with him almost by the force alone\\nof friendship and of duty. Had he done well in that? Was it not like\\nattempting to tread forbidden paths? Was he not, in this trip, trying\\nto pass the borders of the impossible? Had not the Almighty reserved for\\nlater ages the knowledge of this inhospitable continent?\\n\\nAll these thoughts, of the kind that arise in hours of discouragement,\\nsucceeded each other and multiplied in his mind, and, by an irresistible\\nassociation of ideas, the doctor allowed himself to be carried beyond\\nthe bounds of logic and of reason. After having established in his own\\nmind what he should NOT have done, the next question was, what he should\\ndo, then. Would it be impossible to retrace his steps? Were there\\nnot currents higher up that would waft him to less arid regions? Well\\ninformed with regard to the countries over which he had passed, he was\\nutterly ignorant of those to come, and thus his conscience speaking\\naloud to him, he resolved, in his turn, to speak frankly to his two\\ncompanions. He thereupon laid the whole state of the case plainly before\\nthem; he showed them what had been done, and what there was yet to do;\\nat the worst, they could return, or attempt it, at least.--What did they\\nthink about it?\\n\\n\"I have no other opinion than that of my excellent master,\" said Joe;\\n\"what he may have to suffer, I can suffer, and that better than he can,\\nperhaps. Where he goes, there I\\'ll go!\"\\n\\n\"And you, Kennedy?\"\\n\\n\"I, doctor, I\\'m not the man to despair; no one was less ignorant than\\nI of the perils of the enterprise, but I did not want to see them,\\nfrom the moment that you determined to brave them. Under present\\ncircumstances, my opinion is, that we should persevere--go clear to\\nthe end. Besides, to return looks to me quite as perilous as the other\\ncourse. So onward, then! you may count upon us!\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, my gallant friends!\" replied the doctor, with much real\\nfeeling, \"I expected such devotion as this; but I needed these\\nencouraging words. Yet, once again, thank you, from the bottom of my\\nheart!\"\\n\\nAnd, with this, the three friends warmly grasped each other by the hand.\\n\\n\"Now, hear me!\" said the doctor. \"According to my solar observations,\\nwe are not more than three hundred miles from the Gulf of Guinea;\\nthe desert, therefore, cannot extend indefinitely, since the coast is\\ninhabited, and the country has been explored for some distance back into\\nthe interior. If needs be, we can direct our course to that quarter, and\\nit seems out of the question that we should not come across some oasis,\\nor some well, where we could replenish our stock of water. But, what we\\nwant now, is the wind, for without it we are held here suspended in the\\nair at a dead calm.\\n\\n\"Let us wait with resignation,\" said the hunter.\\n\\nBut, each of the party, in his turn, vainly scanned the space around him\\nduring that long wearisome day. Nothing could be seen to form the basis\\nof a hope. The very last inequalities of the soil disappeared with the\\nsetting sun, whose horizontal rays stretched in long lines of fire over\\nthe flat immensity. It was the Desert!\\n\\nOur aeronauts had scarcely gone a distance of fifteen miles, having\\nexpended, as on the preceding day, one hundred and thirty-five cubic\\nfeet of gas to feed the cylinder, and two pints of water out of the\\nremaining eight had been sacrificed to the demands of intense thirst.\\n\\nThe night passed quietly--too quietly, indeed, but the doctor did not\\nsleep!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-FIFTH.\\n\\nA Little Philosophy.--A Cloud on the Horizon.--In the Midst of a\\nFog.--The Strange Balloon.--An Exact View of the Victoria.--The\\nPalm-Trees.--Traces of a Caravan.--The Well in the Midst of the Desert.\\n\\nOn the morrow, there was the same purity of sky, the same stillness of\\nthe atmosphere. The balloon rose to an elevation of five hundred\\nfeet, but it had scarcely changed its position to the westward in any\\nperceptible degree.\\n\\n\"We are right in the open desert,\" said the doctor. \"Look at that vast\\nreach of sand! What a strange spectacle! What a singular arrangement of\\nnature! Why should there be, in one place, such extreme luxuriance of\\nvegetation yonder, and here, this extreme aridity, and that in the same\\nlatitude, and under the same rays of the sun?\"\\n\\n\"The why concerns me but little,\" answered Kennedy, \"the reason\\ninterests me less than the fact. The thing is so; that\\'s the important\\npart of it!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is well to philosophize a little, Dick; it does no harm.\"\\n\\n\"Let us philosophize, then, if you will; we have time enough before us;\\nwe are hardly moving; the wind is afraid to blow; it sleeps.\"\\n\\n\"That will not last forever,\" put in Joe; \"I think I see some banks of\\nclouds in the east.\"\\n\\n\"Joe\\'s right!\" said the doctor, after he had taken a look.\\n\\n\"Good!\" said Kennedy; \"now for our clouds, with a fine rain, and a fresh\\nwind to dash it into our faces!\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see, Dick, we\\'ll see!\"\\n\\n\"But this is Friday, master, and I\\'m afraid of Fridays!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I hope that this very day you\\'ll get over those notions.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, master, too. Whew!\" he added, mopping his face, \"heat\\'s a\\ngood thing, especially in winter, but in summer it don\\'t do to take too\\nmuch of it.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you fear the effect of the sun\\'s heat on our balloon?\" asked\\nKennedy, addressing the doctor.\\n\\n\"No! the gutta-percha coating resists much higher temperatures than\\neven this. With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one\\nhundred and fifty-eight degrees sometimes, and the covering does not\\nappear to have suffered.\"\\n\\n\"A cloud! a real cloud!\" shouted Joe at this moment, for that piercing\\neyesight of his beat all the glasses.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, a thick bank of vapor, now quite distinct, could be seen\\nslowly emerging above the horizon. It appeared to be very deep, and,\\nas it were, puffed out. It was, in reality, a conglomeration of smaller\\nclouds. The latter invariably retained their original formation, and\\nfrom this circumstance the doctor concluded that there was no current of\\nair in their collected mass.\\n\\nThis compact body of vapor had appeared about eight o\\'clock in the\\nmorning, and, by eleven, it had already reached the height of the sun\\'s\\ndisk. The latter then disappeared entirely behind the murky veil, and\\nthe lower belt of cloud, at the same moment, lifted above the line of\\nthe horizon, which was again disclosed in a full blaze of daylight.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only an isolated cloud,\" remarked the doctor. \"It won\\'t do to\\ncount much upon that.\"\\n\\n\"Look, Dick, its shape is just the same as when we saw it this morning!\"\\n\\n\"Then, doctor, there\\'s to be neither rain nor wind, at least for us!\"\\n\\n\"I fear so; the cloud keeps at a great height.\"\\n\\n\"Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it\\nrefuses to burst upon us?\"\\n\\n\"I fancy that to do so wouldn\\'t help us much; it would be a consumption\\nof gas, and, consequently, of water, to little purpose; but, in our\\nsituation, we must not leave anything untried; therefore, let us\\nascend!\"\\n\\nAnd with this, the doctor put on a full head of flame from the cylinder,\\nand the dilation of the hydrogen, occasioned by such sudden and intense\\nheat, sent the balloon rapidly aloft.\\n\\nAbout fifteen hundred feet from the ground, it encountered an opaque\\nmass of cloud, and entered a dense fog, suspended at that elevation;\\nbut it did not meet with the least breath of wind. This fog seemed even\\ndestitute of humidity, and the articles brought in contact with it\\nwere scarcely dampened in the slightest degree. The balloon, completely\\nenveloped in the vapor, gained a little increase of speed, perhaps, and\\nthat was all.\\n\\nThe doctor gloomily recognized what trifling success he had obtained\\nfrom his manoeuvre, and was relapsing into deep meditation, when he\\nheard Joe exclaim, in tones of most intense astonishment:\\n\\n\"Ah! by all that\\'s beautiful!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"Doctor! Mr. Kennedy! Here\\'s something curious!\"\\n\\n\"What is it, then?\"\\n\\n\"We are not alone, up here! There are rogues about! They\\'ve stolen our\\ninvention!\"\\n\\n\"Has he gone crazy?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\nJoe stood there, perfectly motionless, the very picture of amazement.\\n\\n\"Can the hot sun have really affected the poor fellow\\'s brain?\" said the\\ndoctor, turning toward him.\\n\\n\"Will you tell me?--\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" said Joe, pointing to a certain quarter of the sky.\\n\\n\"By St. James!\" exclaimed Kennedy, in turn, \"why, who would have\\nbelieved it? Look, look! doctor!\"\\n\\n\"I see it!\" said the doctor, very quietly.\\n\\n\"Another balloon! and other passengers, like ourselves!\"\\n\\nAnd, sure enough, there was another balloon about two hundred paces\\nfrom them, floating in the air with its car and its aeronauts. It was\\nfollowing exactly the same route as the Victoria.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"nothing remains for us but to make signals;\\ntake the flag, Kennedy, and show them our colors.\"\\n\\nIt seemed that the travellers by the other balloon had just the same\\nidea, at the same moment, for the same kind of flag repeated precisely\\nthe same salute with a hand that moved in just the same manner.\\n\\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"They are apes,\" said Joe, \"imitating us.\"\\n\\n\"It means,\" said the doctor, laughing, \"that it is you, Dick, yourself,\\nmaking that signal to yourself; or, in other words, that we see\\nourselves in the second balloon, which is no other than the Victoria.\"\\n\\n\"As to that, master, with all respect to you,\" said Joe, \"you\\'ll never\\nmake me believe it.\"\\n\\n\"Climb up on the edge of the car, Joe; wave your arms, and then you\\'ll\\nsee.\"\\n\\nJoe obeyed, and all his gestures were instantaneously and exactly\\nrepeated.\\n\\n\"It is merely the effect of the MIRAGE,\" said the doctor, \"and nothing\\nelse--a simple optical phenomenon due to the unequal refraction of light\\nby different layers of the atmosphere, and that is all.\\n\\n\"It\\'s wonderful,\" said Joe, who could not make up his mind to surrender,\\nbut went on repeating his gesticulations.\\n\\n\"What a curious sight! Do you know,\" said Kennedy, \"that it\\'s a real\\npleasure to have a view of our noble balloon in that style? She\\'s a\\nbeauty, isn\\'t she?--and how stately her movements as she sweeps along!\"\\n\\n\"You may explain the matter as you like,\" continued Joe, \"it\\'s a strange\\nthing, anyhow!\"\\n\\nBut ere long this picture began to fade away; the clouds rose higher,\\nleaving the balloon, which made no further attempt to follow them, and\\nin about an hour they disappeared in the open sky.\\n\\nThe wind, which had been scarcely perceptible, seemed still to diminish,\\nand the doctor in perfect desperation descended toward the ground, and\\nall three of the travellers, whom the incident just recorded had, for\\na few moments, diverted from their anxieties, relapsed into gloomy\\nmeditation, sweltering the while beneath the scorching heat.\\n\\nAbout four o\\'clock, Joe descried some object standing out against the\\nvast background of sand, and soon was able to declare positively that\\nthere were two palm-trees at no great distance.\\n\\n\"Palm-trees!\" exclaimed Ferguson; \"why, then there\\'s a spring--a well!\"\\n\\nHe took up his glass and satisfied himself that Joe\\'s eyes had not been\\nmistaken.\\n\\n\"At length!\" he said, over and over again, \"water! water! and we are\\nsaved; for if we do move slowly, still we move, and we shall arrive at\\nlast!\"\\n\\n\"Good, master! but suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time,\\nfor this air is stifling?\"\\n\\n\"Let us drink then, my boy!\"\\n\\nNo one waited to be coaxed. A whole pint was swallowed then and there,\\nreducing the total remaining supply to three pints and a half.\\n\\n\"Ah! that does one good!\" said Joe; \"wasn\\'t it fine? Barclay and Perkins\\nnever turned out ale equal to that!\"\\n\\n\"See the advantage of being put on short allowance!\" moralized the\\ndoctor.\\n\\n\"It is not great, after all,\" retorted Kennedy; \"and if I were never\\nagain to have the pleasure of drinking water, I should agree on\\ncondition that I should never be deprived of it.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock the balloon was floating over the palm-trees.\\n\\nThey were two shrivelled, stunted, dried-up specimens of trees--two\\nghosts of palms--without foliage, and more dead than alive. Ferguson\\nexamined them with terror.\\n\\nAt their feet could be seen the half-worn stones of a spring, but these\\nstones, pulverized by the baking heat of the sun, seemed to be nothing\\nnow but impalpable dust. There was not the slightest sign of moisture.\\nThe doctor\\'s heart shrank within him, and he was about to communicate\\nhis thoughts to his companions, when their exclamations attracted his\\nattention. As far as the eye could reach to the eastward, extended\\na long line of whitened bones; pieces of skeletons surrounded the\\nfountain; a caravan had evidently made its way to that point, marking\\nits progress by its bleaching remains; the weaker had fallen one by one\\nupon the sand; the stronger, having at length reached this spring for\\nwhich they panted, had there found a horrible death.\\n\\nOur travellers looked at each other and turned pale.\\n\\n\"Let us not alight!\" said Kennedy, \"let us fly from this hideous\\nspectacle! There\\'s not a drop of water here!\"\\n\\n\"No, Dick, as well pass the night here as elsewhere; let us have a clear\\nconscience in the matter. We\\'ll dig down to the very bottom of the well.\\nThere has been a spring here, and perhaps there\\'s something left in it!\"\\n\\nThe Victoria touched the ground; Joe and Kennedy put into the car\\na quantity of sand equal to their weight, and leaped out. They then\\nhastened to the well, and penetrated to the interior by a flight of\\nsteps that was now nothing but dust. The spring appeared to have been\\ndry for years. They dug down into a parched and powdery sand--the very\\ndryest of all sand, indeed--there was not one trace of moisture!\\n\\nThe doctor saw them come up to the surface of the desert, saturated with\\nperspiration, worn out, covered with fine dust, exhausted, discouraged\\nand despairing.\\n\\nHe then comprehended that their search had been fruitless. He had\\nexpected as much, and he kept silent, for he felt that, from this moment\\nforth, he must have courage and energy enough for three.\\n\\nJoe brought up with him some pieces of a leathern bottle that had grown\\nhard and horn-like with age, and angrily flung them away among the\\nbleaching bones of the caravan.\\n\\nAt supper, not a word was spoken by our travellers, and they even ate\\nwithout appetite. Yet they had not, up to this moment, endured the real\\nagonies of thirst, and were in no desponding mood, excepting for the\\nfuture.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH.\\n\\nOne Hundred and Thirteen Degrees.--The Doctor\\'s Reflections.--A\\nDesperate Search.--The Cylinder goes out.--One Hundred and\\nTwenty-two Degrees.--Contemplation of the Desert.--A Night\\nWalk.--Solitude.--Debility.--Joe\\'s Prospects.--He gives himself One Day\\nmore.\\n\\nThe distance made by the balloon during the preceding day did not exceed\\nten miles, and, to keep it afloat, one hundred and sixty-two cubic feet\\nof gas had been consumed.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning the doctor again gave the signal for departure.\\n\\n\"The cylinder can work only six hours longer; and, if in that time we\\nshall not have found either a well or a spring of water, God alone knows\\nwhat will become of us!\"\\n\\n\"Not much wind this morning, master,\" said Joe; \"but it will come\\nup, perhaps,\" he added, suddenly remarking the doctor\\'s ill-concealed\\ndepression.\\n\\nVain hope! The atmosphere was in a dead calm--one of those calms which\\nhold vessels captive in tropical seas. The heat had become intolerable;\\nand the thermometer, in the shade under the awning, indicated one\\nhundred and thirteen degrees.\\n\\nJoe and Kennedy, reclining at full length near each other, tried, if\\nnot in slumber, at least in torpor, to forget their situation, for their\\nforced inactivity gave them periods of leisure far from pleasant.\\nThat man is to be pitied the most who cannot wean himself from gloomy\\nreflections by actual work, or some practical pursuit. But here there\\nwas nothing to look after, nothing to undertake, and they had to submit\\nto the situation, without having it in their power to ameliorate it.\\n\\nThe pangs of thirst began to be severely felt; brandy, far from\\nappeasing this imperious necessity, augmented it, and richly merited the\\nname of \"tiger\\'s milk\" applied to it by the African natives. Scarcely\\ntwo pints of water remained, and that was heated. Each of the party\\ndevoured the few precious drops with his gaze, yet neither of them dared\\nto moisten his lips with them. Two pints of water in the midst of the\\ndesert!\\n\\nThen it was that Dr. Ferguson, buried in meditation, asked himself\\nwhether he had acted with prudence. Would he not have done better to\\nhave kept the water that he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to\\nsustain him in the air? He had gained a little distance, to be sure; but\\nwas he any nearer to his journey\\'s end? What difference did sixty miles\\nto the rear make in this region, when there was no water to be had where\\nthey were? The wind, should it rise, would blow there as it did here,\\nonly less strongly at this point, if it came from the east. But hope\\nurged him onward. And yet those two gallons of water, expended in vain,\\nwould have sufficed for nine days\\' halt in the desert. And what changes\\nmight not have occurred in nine days! Perhaps, too, while retaining\\nthe water, he might have ascended by throwing out ballast, at the cost\\nmerely of discharging some gas, when he had again to descend. But the\\ngas in his balloon was his blood, his very life!\\n\\nA thousand one such reflections whirled in succession through his brain;\\nand, resting his head between his hands, he sat there for hours without\\nraising it.\\n\\n\"We must make one final effort,\" he said, at last, about ten o\\'clock in\\nthe morning. \"We must endeavor, just once more, to find an atmospheric\\ncurrent to bear us away from here, and, to that end, must risk our last\\nresources.\"\\n\\nTherefore, while his companions slept, the doctor raised the hydrogen in\\nthe balloon to an elevated temperature, and the huge globe, filling out\\nby the dilation of the gas, rose straight up in the perpendicular rays\\nof the sun. The doctor searched vainly for a breath of wind, from the\\nheight of one hundred feet to that of five miles; his starting-point\\nremained fatally right below him, and absolute calm seemed to reign, up\\nto the extreme limits of the breathing atmosphere.\\n\\nAt length the feeding-supply of water gave out; the cylinder was\\nextinguished for lack of gas; the Buntzen battery ceased to work, and\\nthe balloon, shrinking together, gently descended to the sand, in the\\nvery place that the car had hollowed out there.\\n\\nIt was noon; and solar observations gave nineteen degrees thirty-five\\nminutes east longitude, and six degrees fifty-one minutes north\\nlatitude, or nearly five hundred miles from Lake Tchad, and more than\\nfour hundred miles from the western coast of Africa.\\n\\nOn the balloon taking ground, Kennedy and Joe awoke from their stupor.\\n\\n\"We have halted,\" said the Scot.\\n\\n\"We had to do so,\" replied the doctor, gravely.\\n\\nHis companions understood him. The level of the soil at that point\\ncorresponded with the level of the sea, and, consequently, the balloon\\nremained in perfect equilibrium, and absolutely motionless.\\n\\nThe weight of the three travellers was replaced with an equivalent\\nquantity of sand, and they got out of the car. Each was absorbed in his\\nown thoughts; and for many hours neither of them spoke. Joe prepared\\ntheir evening meal, which consisted of biscuit and pemmican, and was\\nhardly tasted by either of the party. A mouthful of scalding water from\\ntheir little store completed this gloomy repast.\\n\\nDuring the night none of them kept awake; yet none could be precisely\\nsaid to have slept. On the morrow there remained only half a pint of\\nwater, and this the doctor put away, all three having resolved not to\\ntouch it until the last extremity.\\n\\nIt was not long, however, before Joe exclaimed:\\n\\n\"I\\'m choking, and the heat is getting worse! I\\'m not surprised at that,\\nthough,\" he added, consulting the thermometer; \"one hundred and forty\\ndegrees!\"\\n\\n\"The sand scorches me,\" said the hunter, \"as though it had just come out\\nof a furnace; and not a cloud in this sky of fire. It\\'s enough to drive\\none mad!\"\\n\\n\"Let us not despair,\" responded the doctor. \"In this latitude these\\nintense heats are invariably followed by storms, and the latter come\\nwith the suddenness of lightning. Notwithstanding this disheartening\\nclearness of the sky, great atmospheric changes may take place in less\\nthan an hour.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" asked Kennedy, \"is there any sign whatever of that?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the doctor, \"I think that there is some slight symptom\\nof a fall in the barometer.\"\\n\\n\"May Heaven hearken to you, Samuel! for here we are pinned to the\\nground, like a bird with broken wings.\"\\n\\n\"With this difference, however, my dear Dick, that our wings are unhurt,\\nand I hope that we shall be able to use them again.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! wind! wind!\" exclaimed Joe; \"enough to carry us to a stream or\\na well, and we\\'ll be all right. We have provisions enough, and, with\\nwater, we could wait a month without suffering; but thirst is a cruel\\nthing!\"\\n\\nIt was not thirst alone, but the unchanging sight of the desert, that\\nfatigued the mind. There was not a variation in the surface of the soil,\\nnot a hillock of sand, not a pebble, to relieve the gaze. This unbroken\\nlevel discouraged the beholder, and gave him that kind of malady called\\nthe \"desert-sickness.\" The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky,\\nand the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand, at length produced a\\nsensation of terror. In this inflamed atmosphere the heat appeared to\\nvibrate as it does above a blazing hearth, while the mind grew desperate\\nin contemplating the limitless calm, and could see no reason why the\\nthing should ever end, since immensity is a species of eternity.\\n\\nThus, at last, our hapless travellers, deprived of water in this torrid\\nheat, began to feel symptoms of mental disorder. Their eyes swelled in\\ntheir sockets, and their gaze became confused.\\n\\nWhen night came on, the doctor determined to combat this alarming\\ntendency by rapid walking. His idea was to pace the sandy plain for a\\nfew hours, not in search of any thing, but simply for exercise.\\n\\n\"Come along!\" he said to his companions; \"believe me, it will do you\\ngood.\"\\n\\n\"Out of the question!\" said Kennedy; \"I could not walk a step.\"\\n\\n\"And I,\" said Joe, \"would rather sleep!\"\\n\\n\"But sleep, or even rest, would be dangerous to you, my friends; you\\nmust react against this tendency to stupor. Come with me!\"\\n\\nBut the doctor could do nothing with them, and, therefore, set off\\nalone, amid the starry clearness of the night. The first few steps he\\ntook were painful, for they were the steps of an enfeebled man quite out\\nof practice in walking. However, he quickly saw that the exercise would\\nbe beneficial to him, and pushed on several miles to the westward. Once\\nin rapid motion, he felt his spirits greatly cheered, when, suddenly, a\\nvertigo came over him; he seemed to be poised on the edge of an abyss;\\nhis knees bent under him; the vast solitude struck terror to his\\nheart; he found himself the minute mathematical point, the centre of\\nan infinite circumference, that is to say--a nothing! The balloon\\nhad disappeared entirely in the deepening gloom. The doctor, cool,\\nimpassible, reckless explorer that he was, felt himself at last seized\\nwith a nameless dread. He strove to retrace his steps, but in vain. He\\ncalled aloud. Not even an echo replied, and his voice died out in\\nthe empty vastness of surrounding space, like a pebble cast into a\\nbottomless gulf; then, down he sank, fainting, on the sand, alone, amid\\nthe eternal silence of the desert.\\n\\nAt midnight he came to, in the arms of his faithful follower, Joe. The\\nlatter, uneasy at his master\\'s prolonged absence, had set out after him,\\neasily tracing him by the clear imprint of his feet in the sand, and had\\nfound him lying in a swoon.\\n\\n\"What has been the matter, sir?\" was the first inquiry.\\n\\n\"Nothing, Joe, nothing! Only a touch of weakness, that\\'s all. It\\'s over\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! it won\\'t amount to any thing, sir, I\\'m sure of that; but get up on\\nyour feet, if you can. There! lean upon me, and let us get back to the\\nballoon.\"\\n\\nAnd the doctor, leaning on Joe\\'s arm, returned along the track by which\\nhe had come.\\n\\n\"You were too bold, sir; it won\\'t do to run such risks. You might have\\nbeen robbed,\" he added, laughing. \"But, sir, come now, let us talk\\nseriously.\"\\n\\n\"Speak! I am listening to you.\"\\n\\n\"We must positively make up our minds to do something. Our present\\nsituation cannot last more than a few days longer, and if we get no\\nwind, we are lost.\"\\n\\nThe doctor made no reply.\\n\\n\"Well, then, one of us must sacrifice himself for the good of all, and\\nit is most natural that it should fall to me to do so.\"\\n\\n\"What have you to propose? What is your plan?\"\\n\\n\"A very simple one! It is to take provisions enough, and to walk right\\non until I come to some place, as I must do, sooner or later. In the\\nmean time, if Heaven sends you a good wind, you need not wait, but\\ncan start again. For my part, if I come to a village, I\\'ll work my way\\nthrough with a few Arabic words that you can write for me on a slip of\\npaper, and I\\'ll bring you help or lose my hide. What do you think of my\\nplan?\"\\n\\n\"It is absolute folly, Joe, but worthy of your noble heart. The thing is\\nimpossible. You will not leave us.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir, we must do something, and this plan can\\'t do you any\\nharm, for, I say again, you need not wait; and then, after all, I may\\nsucceed.\"\\n\\n\"No, Joe, no! We will not separate. That would only be adding sorrow to\\ntrouble. It was written that matters should be as they are; and it is\\nvery probably written that it shall be quite otherwise by-and-by. Let us\\nwait, then, with resignation.\"\\n\\n\"So be it, master; but take notice of one thing: I give you a day\\nlonger, and I\\'ll not wait after that. To-day is Sunday; we might say\\nMonday, as it is one o\\'clock in the morning, and if we don\\'t get off by\\nTuesday, I\\'ll run the risk. I\\'ve made up my mind to that!\"\\n\\nThe doctor made no answer, and in a few minutes they got back to the\\ncar, where he took his place beside Kennedy, who lay there plunged in\\nsilence so complete that it could not be considered sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH.\\n\\nTerrific Heat.--Hallucinations.--The Last Drops of Water.--Nights of\\nDespair.--An Attempt at Suicide.--The Simoom.--The Oasis.--The Lion and\\nLioness.\\n\\nThe doctor\\'s first care, on the morrow, was to consult the barometer.\\nHe found that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible\\ndepression.\\n\\n\"Nothing!\" he murmured, \"nothing!\"\\n\\nHe got out of the car and scrutinized the weather; there was only the\\nsame heat, the same cloudless sky, the same merciless drought.\\n\\n\"Must we, then, give up to despair?\" he exclaimed, in agony.\\n\\nJoe did not open his lips. He was buried in his own thoughts, and\\nplanning the expedition he had proposed.\\n\\nKennedy got up, feeling very ill, and a prey to nervous agitation. He\\nwas suffering horribly with thirst, and his swollen tongue and lips\\ncould hardly articulate a syllable.\\n\\nThere still remained a few drops of water. Each of them knew this, and\\neach was thinking of it, and felt himself drawn toward them; but neither\\nof the three dared to take a step.\\n\\nThose three men, friends and companions as they were, fixed their\\nhaggard eyes upon each other with an instinct of ferocious longing,\\nwhich was most plainly revealed in the hardy Scot, whose vigorous\\nconstitution yielded the soonest to these unnatural privations.\\n\\nThroughout the day he was delirious, pacing up and down, uttering hoarse\\ncries, gnawing his clinched fists, and ready to open his veins and drink\\nhis own hot blood.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"land of thirst! Well might you be called the land of\\ndespair!\"\\n\\nAt length he sank down in utter prostration, and his friends heard no\\nother sound from him than the hissing of his breath between his parched\\nand swollen lips.\\n\\nToward evening, Joe had his turn of delirium. The vast expanse of sand\\nappeared to him an immense pond, full of clear and limpid water; and,\\nmore than once, he dashed himself upon the scorching waste to drink long\\ndraughts, and rose again with his mouth clogged with hot dust.\\n\\n\"Curses on it!\" he yelled, in his madness, \"it\\'s nothing but salt\\nwater!\"\\n\\nThen, while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless, the resistless\\nlonging came over him to drain the last few drops of water that had\\nbeen kept in reserve. The natural instinct proved too strong. He dragged\\nhimself toward the car, on his knees; he glared at the bottle containing\\nthe precious fluid; he gave one wild, eager glance, seized the treasured\\nstore, and bore it to his lips.\\n\\nAt that instant he heard a heart-rending cry close beside him--\"Water!\\nwater!\"\\n\\nIt was Kennedy, who had crawled up close to him, and was begging there,\\nupon his knees, and weeping piteously.\\n\\nJoe, himself in tears, gave the poor wretch the bottle, and Kennedy\\ndrained the last drop with savage haste.\\n\\n\"Thanks!\" he murmured hoarsely, but Joe did not hear him, for both alike\\nhad dropped fainting on the sand.\\n\\nWhat took place during that fearful night neither of them knew, but, on\\nTuesday morning, under those showers of heat which the sun poured down\\nupon them, the unfortunate men felt their limbs gradually drying up, and\\nwhen Joe attempted to rise he found it impossible.\\n\\nHe looked around him. In the car, the doctor, completely overwhelmed,\\nsat with his arms folded on his breast, gazing with idiotic fixedness\\nupon some imaginary point in space. Kennedy was frightful to behold. He\\nwas rolling his head from right to left like a wild beast in a cage.\\n\\nAll at once, his eyes rested on the butt of his rifle, which jutted\\nabove the rim of the car.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" he screamed, raising himself with a superhuman effort.\\n\\nDesperate, mad, he snatched at the weapon, and turned the barrel toward\\nhis mouth.\\n\\n\"Kennedy!\" shouted Joe, throwing himself upon his friend.\\n\\n\"Let go! hands off!\" moaned the Scot, in a hoarse, grating voice--and\\nthen the two struggled desperately for the rifle.\\n\\n\"Let go, or I\\'ll kill you!\" repeated Kennedy. But Joe clung to him only\\nthe more fiercely, and they had been contending thus without the doctor\\nseeing them for many seconds, when, suddenly the rifle went off. At the\\nsound of its discharge, the doctor rose up erect, like a spectre, and\\nglared around him.\\n\\nBut all at once his glance grew more animated; he extended his hand\\ntoward the horizon, and in a voice no longer human shrieked:\\n\\n\"There! there--off there!\"\\n\\nThere was such fearful force in the cry that Kennedy and Joe released\\neach other, and both looked where the doctor pointed.\\n\\nThe plain was agitated like the sea shaken by the fury of a tempest;\\nbillows of sand went tossing over each other amid blinding clouds of\\ndust; an immense pillar was seen whirling toward them through the air\\nfrom the southeast, with terrific velocity; the sun was disappearing\\nbehind an opaque veil of cloud whose enormous barrier extended clear to\\nthe horizon, while the grains of fine sand went gliding together with\\nall the supple ease of liquid particles, and the rising dust-tide gained\\nmore and more with every second.\\n\\nFerguson\\'s eyes gleamed with a ray of energetic hope.\\n\\n\"The simoom!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"The simoom!\" repeated Joe, without exactly knowing what it meant.\\n\\n\"So much the better!\" said Kennedy, with the bitterness of despair. \"So\\nmuch the better--we shall die!\"\\n\\n\"So much the better!\" echoed the doctor, \"for we shall live!\" and, so\\nsaying, he began rapidly to throw out the sand that encumbered the car.\\n\\nAt length his companions understood him, and took their places at his\\nside.\\n\\n\"And now, Joe,\" said the doctor, \"throw out some fifty pounds of your\\nore, there!\"\\n\\nJoe no longer hesitated, although he still felt a fleeting pang of\\nregret. The balloon at once began to ascend.\\n\\n\"It was high time!\" said the doctor.\\n\\nThe simoom, in fact, came rushing on like a thunderbolt, and a moment\\nlater the balloon would have been crushed, torn to atoms, annihilated.\\nThe awful whirlwind was almost upon it, and it was already pelted with\\nshowers of sand driven like hail by the storm.\\n\\n\"Out with more ballast!\" shouted the doctor.\\n\\n\"There!\" responded Joe, tossing over a huge fragment of quartz.\\n\\nWith this, the Victoria rose swiftly above the range of the whirling\\ncolumn, but, caught in the vast displacement of the atmosphere thereby\\noccasioned, it was borne along with incalculable rapidity away above\\nthis foaming sea.\\n\\nThe three travellers did not speak. They gazed, and hoped, and even felt\\nrefreshed by the breath of the tempest.\\n\\nAbout three o\\'clock, the whirlwind ceased; the sand, falling again upon\\nthe desert, formed numberless little hillocks, and the sky resumed its\\nformer tranquillity.\\n\\nThe balloon, which had again lost its momentum, was floating in sight of\\nan oasis, a sort of islet studded with green trees, thrown up upon the\\nsurface of this sandy ocean.\\n\\n\"Water! we\\'ll find water there!\" said the doctor.\\n\\nAnd, instantly, opening the upper valve, he let some hydrogen escape,\\nand slowly descended, taking the ground at about two hundred feet from\\nthe edge of the oasis.\\n\\nIn four hours the travellers had swept over a distance of two hundred\\nand forty miles!\\n\\nThe car was at once ballasted, and Kennedy, closely followed by Joe,\\nleaped out.\\n\\n\"Take your guns with you!\" said the doctor; \"take your guns, and be\\ncareful!\"\\n\\nDick grasped his rifle, and Joe took one of the fowling-pieces. They\\nthen rapidly made for the trees, and disappeared under the fresh\\nverdure, which announced the presence of abundant springs. As they\\nhurried on, they had not taken notice of certain large footprints and\\nfresh tracks of some living creature marked here and there in the damp\\nsoil.\\n\\nSuddenly, a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them.\\n\\n\"The roar of a lion!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Good for that!\" said the excited hunter; \"we\\'ll fight him. A man feels\\nstrong when only a fight\\'s in question.\"\\n\\n\"But be careful, Mr. Kennedy; be careful! The lives of all depend upon\\nthe life of one.\"\\n\\nBut Kennedy no longer heard him; he was pushing on, his eye blazing; his\\nrifle cocked; fearful to behold in his daring rashness. There, under a\\npalm-tree, stood an enormous black-maned lion, crouching for a spring on\\nhis antagonist. Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter, when he\\nbounded through the air; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet\\npierced his heart, and he fell to the earth dead.\\n\\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted Joe, with wild exultation.\\n\\nKennedy rushed toward the well, slid down the dampened steps, and\\nflung himself at full length by the side of a fresh spring, in which\\nhe plunged his parched lips. Joe followed suit, and for some minutes\\nnothing was heard but the sound they made with their mouths, drinking\\nmore like maddened beasts than men.\\n\\n\"Take care, Mr. Kennedy,\" said Joe at last; \"let us not overdo the\\nthing!\" and he panted for breath.\\n\\nBut Kennedy, without a word, drank on. He even plunged his hands,\\nand then his head, into the delicious tide--he fairly revelled in its\\ncoolness.\\n\\n\"But the doctor?\" said Joe; \"our friend, Dr. Ferguson?\"\\n\\nThat one word recalled Kennedy to himself, and, hastily filling a flask\\nthat he had brought with him, he started on a run up the steps of the\\nwell.\\n\\nBut what was his amazement when he saw an opaque body of enormous\\ndimensions blocking up the passage! Joe, who was close upon Kennedy\\'s\\nheels, recoiled with him.\\n\\n\"We are blocked in--entrapped!\"\\n\\n\"Impossible! What does that mean?--\"\\n\\nDick had no time to finish; a terrific roar made him only too quickly\\naware what foe confronted him.\\n\\n\"Another lion!\" exclaimed Joe.\\n\\n\"A lioness, rather,\" said Kennedy. \"Ah! ferocious brute!\" he added,\\n\"I\\'ll settle you in a moment more!\" and swiftly reloaded his rifle.\\n\\nIn another instant he fired, but the animal had disappeared.\\n\\n\"Onward!\" shouted Kennedy.\\n\\n\"No!\" interposed the other, \"that shot did not kill her; her body would\\nhave rolled down the steps; she\\'s up there, ready to spring upon the\\nfirst of us who appears, and he would be a lost man!\"\\n\\n\"But what are we to do? We must get out of this, and the doctor is\\nexpecting us.\"\\n\\n\"Let us decoy the animal. Take my piece, and give me your rifle.\"\\n\\n\"What is your plan?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nAnd Joe, taking off his linen jacket, hung it on the end of the rifle,\\nand thrust it above the top of the steps. The lioness flung herself\\nfuriously upon it. Kennedy was on the alert for her, and his bullet\\nbroke her shoulder. The lioness, with a frightful howl of agony, rolled\\ndown the steps, overturning Joe in her fall. The poor fellow imagined\\nthat he could already feel the enormous paws of the savage beast in his\\nflesh, when a second detonation resounded in the narrow passage, and Dr.\\nFerguson appeared at the opening above with his gun in hand, and still\\nsmoking from the discharge.\\n\\nJoe leaped to his feet, clambered over the body of the dead lioness, and\\nhanded up the flask full of sparkling water to his master.\\n\\nTo carry it to his lips, and to half empty it at a draught, was the\\nwork of an instant, and the three travellers offered up thanks from the\\ndepths of their hearts to that Providence who had so miraculously saved\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTH.\\n\\nAn Evening of Delight.--Joe\\'s Culinary Performance.--A Dissertation\\non Raw Meat.--The Narrative of James Bruce.--Camping out.--Joe\\'s\\nDreams.--The Barometer begins to fall.--The Barometer rises\\nagain.--Preparations for Departure.--The Tempest.\\n\\nThe evening was lovely, and our three friends enjoyed it in the cool\\nshade of the mimosas, after a substantial repast, at which the tea and\\nthe punch were dealt out with no niggardly hand.\\n\\nKennedy had traversed the little domain in all directions. He had\\nransacked every thicket and satisfied himself that the balloon party\\nwere the only living creatures in this terrestrial paradise; so they\\nstretched themselves upon their blankets and passed a peaceful night\\nthat brought them forgetfulness of their past sufferings.\\n\\nOn the morrow, May 7th, the sun shone with all his splendor, but his\\nrays could not penetrate the dense screen of the palm-tree foliage, and\\nas there was no lack of provisions, the doctor resolved to remain where\\nhe was while waiting for a favorable wind.\\n\\nJoe had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis, and proceeded to\\nindulge in any number of culinary combinations, using water all the time\\nwith the most profuse extravagance.\\n\\n\"What a strange succession of annoyances and enjoyments!\" moralized\\nKennedy. \"Such abundance as this after such privations; such luxury\\nafter such want! Ah! I nearly went mad!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Dick,\" replied the doctor, \"had it not been for Joe, you would\\nnot be sitting here, to-day, discoursing on the instability of human\\naffairs.\"\\n\\n\"Whole-hearted friend!\" said Kennedy, extending his hand to Joe.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no occasion for all that,\" responded the latter; \"but you can\\ntake your revenge some time, Mr. Kennedy, always hoping though that you\\nmay never have occasion to do the same for me!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a poor constitution this of ours to succumb to so little,\"\\nphilosophized Dr. Ferguson.\\n\\n\"So little water, you mean, doctor,\" interposed Joe; \"that element must\\nbe very necessary to life.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly, and persons deprived of food hold out longer than those\\ndeprived of water.\"\\n\\n\"I believe it. Besides, when needs must, one can eat any thing he comes\\nacross, even his fellow-creatures, although that must be a kind of food\\nthat\\'s pretty hard to digest.\"\\n\\n\"The savages don\\'t boggle much about it!\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Yes; but then they are savages, and accustomed to devouring raw meat;\\nit\\'s something that I\\'d find very disgusting, for my part.\"\\n\\n\"It is disgusting enough,\" said the doctor, \"that\\'s a fact; and so\\nmuch so, indeed, that nobody believed the narratives of the earliest\\ntravellers in Africa who brought back word that many tribes on that\\ncontinent subsisted upon raw meat, and people generally refused to\\ncredit the statement. It was under such circumstances that a very\\nsingular adventure befell James Bruce.\"\\n\\n\"Tell it to us, doctor; we\\'ve time enough to hear it,\" said Joe,\\nstretching himself voluptuously on the cool greensward.\\n\\n\"By all means.--James Bruce was a Scotchman, of Stirlingshire, who,\\nbetween 1768 and 1772, traversed all Abyssinia, as far as Lake Tyana, in\\nsearch of the sources of the Nile. He afterward returned to England, but\\ndid not publish an account of his journeys until 1790. His statements\\nwere received with extreme incredulity, and such may be the reception\\naccorded to our own. The manners and customs of the Abyssinians seemed\\nso different from those of the English, that no one would credit the\\ndescription of them. Among other details, Bruce had put forward the\\nassertion that the tribes of Eastern Africa fed upon raw flesh, and this\\nset everybody against him. He might say so as much as he pleased; there\\nwas no one likely to go and see! One day, in a parlor at Edinburgh, a\\nScotch gentleman took up the subject in his presence, as it had become\\nthe topic of daily pleasantry, and, in reference to the eating of raw\\nflesh, said that the thing was neither possible nor true. Bruce made no\\nreply, but went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak,\\nseasoned with pepper and salt, in the African style.\\n\\n\"\\'Sir,\\' said he to the Scotchman, \\'in doubting my statements, you have\\ngrossly affronted me; in believing the thing to be impossible, you have\\nbeen egregiously mistaken; and, in proof thereof, you will now eat this\\nbeef-steak raw, or you will give me instant satisfaction!\\' The Scotchman\\nhad a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller, and DID eat the steak,\\nalthough not without a good many wry faces. Thereupon, with the utmost\\ncoolness, James Bruce added: \\'Even admitting, sir, that the thing were\\nuntrue, you will, at least, no longer maintain that it is impossible.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well put in!\" said Joe, \"and if the Scotchman found it lie heavy on his\\nstomach, he got no more than he deserved. If, on our return to England,\\nthey dare to doubt what we say about our travels--\"\\n\\n\"Well, Joe, what would you do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ll make the doubters swallow the pieces of the balloon, without\\neither salt or pepper!\"\\n\\nAll burst out laughing at Joe\\'s queer notions, and thus the day slipped\\nby in pleasant chat. With returning strength, hope had revived, and with\\nhope came the courage to do and to dare. The past was obliterated in the\\npresence of the future with providential rapidity.\\n\\nJoe would have been willing to remain forever in this enchanting asylum;\\nit was the realm he had pictured in his dreams; he felt himself at\\nhome; his master had to give him his exact location, and it was with the\\ngravest air imaginable that he wrote down on his tablets fifteen degrees\\nforty-three minutes east longitude, and eight degrees thirty-two minutes\\nnorth latitude.\\n\\nKennedy had but one regret, to wit, that he could not hunt in that\\nminiature forest, because, according to his ideas, there was a slight\\ndeficiency of ferocious wild beasts in it.\\n\\n\"But, my dear Dick,\" said the doctor, \"haven\\'t you rather a short\\nmemory? How about the lion and the lioness?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that!\" he ejaculated with the contempt of a thorough-bred sportsman\\nfor game already killed. \"But the fact is, that finding them here would\\nlead one to suppose that we can\\'t be far from a more fertile country.\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t prove much, Dick, for those animals, when goaded by hunger or\\nthirst, will travel long distances, and I think that, to-night, we had\\nbetter keep a more vigilant lookout, and light fires, besides.\"\\n\\n\"What, in such heat as this?\" said Joe. \"Well, if it\\'s necessary, we\\'ll\\nhave to do it, but I do think it a real pity to burn this pretty grove\\nthat has been such a comfort to us!\"\\n\\n\"Oh! above all things, we must take the utmost care not to set it\\non fire,\" replied the doctor, \"so that others in the same strait as\\nourselves may some day find shelter here in the middle of the desert.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be very careful, indeed, doctor; but do you think that this oasis\\nis known?\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly; it is a halting-place for the caravans that frequent the\\ncentre of Africa, and a visit from one of them might be any thing but\\npleasant to you, Joe.\"\\n\\n\"Why, are there any more of those rascally Nyam-Nyams around here?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; that is the general name of all the neighboring tribes,\\nand, under the same climates, the same races are likely to have similar\\nmanners and customs.\"\\n\\n\"Pah!\" said Joe, \"but, after all, it\\'s natural enough. If savages had\\nthe ways of gentlemen, where would be the difference? By George, these\\nfine fellows wouldn\\'t have to be coaxed long to eat the Scotchman\\'s raw\\nsteak, nor the Scotchman either, into the bargain!\"\\n\\nWith this very sensible observation, Joe began to get ready his firewood\\nfor the night, making just as little of it as possible. Fortunately,\\nthese precautions were superfluous; and each of the party, in his turn,\\ndropped off into the soundest slumber.\\n\\nOn the next day the weather still showed no sign of change, but kept\\nprovokingly and obstinately fair. The balloon remained motionless,\\nwithout any oscillation to betray a breath of wind.\\n\\nThe doctor began to get uneasy again. If their stay in the desert were\\nto be prolonged like this, their provisions would give out. After nearly\\nperishing for want of water, they would, at last, have to starve to\\ndeath!\\n\\nBut he took fresh courage as he saw the mercury fall considerably in\\nthe barometer, and noticed evident signs of an early change in the\\natmosphere. He therefore resolved to make all his preparations for a\\nstart, so as to avail himself of the first opportunity. The feeding-tank\\nand the water-tank were both completely filled.\\n\\nThen he had to reestablish the equilibrium of the balloon, and Joe\\nwas obliged to part with another considerable portion of his precious\\nquartz. With restored health, his ambitious notions had come back to\\nhim, and he made more than one wry face before obeying his master;\\nbut the latter convinced him that he could not carry so considerable\\na weight with him through the air, and gave him his choice between the\\nwater and the gold. Joe hesitated no longer, but flung out the requisite\\nquantity of his much-prized ore upon the sand.\\n\\n\"The next people who come this way,\" he remarked, \"will be rather\\nsurprised to find a fortune in such a place.\"\\n\\n\"And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens,\\neh?\" suggested Kennedy.\\n\\n\"You may be certain, Dick, that they would take him by surprise, and\\nthat he would publish his astonishment in several folios; so that some\\nday we shall hear of a wonderful deposit of gold-bearing quartz in the\\nmidst of the African sands!\"\\n\\n\"And Joe there, will be the cause of it all!\"\\n\\nThis idea of mystifying some learned sage tickled Joe hugely, and made\\nhim laugh.\\n\\nDuring the rest of the day the doctor vainly kept on the watch for a\\nchange of weather. The temperature rose, and, had it not been for the\\nshade of the oasis, would have been insupportable. The thermometer\\nmarked a hundred and forty-nine degrees in the sun, and a veritable rain\\nof fire filled the air. This was the most intense heat that they had yet\\nnoted.\\n\\nJoe arranged their bivouac for that evening, as he had done for the\\nprevious night; and during the watches kept by the doctor and Kennedy\\nthere was no fresh incident.\\n\\nBut, toward three o\\'clock in the morning, while Joe was on guard, the\\ntemperature suddenly fell; the sky became overcast with clouds, and the\\ndarkness increased.\\n\\n\"Turn out!\" cried Joe, arousing his companions. \"Turn out! Here\\'s the\\nwind!\"\\n\\n\"At last!\" exclaimed the doctor, eying the heavens. \"But it is a storm!\\nThe balloon! Let us hasten to the balloon!\"\\n\\nIt was high time for them to reach it. The Victoria was bending to the\\nforce of the hurricane, and dragging along the car, the latter grazing\\nthe sand. Had any portion of the ballast been accidentally thrown out,\\nthe balloon would have been swept away, and all hope of recovering it\\nhave been forever lost.\\n\\nBut fleet-footed Joe put forth his utmost speed, and checked the car,\\nwhile the balloon beat upon the sand, at the risk of being torn\\nto pieces. The doctor, followed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his\\ncylinder, while his companions threw out the superfluous ballast.\\n\\nThe travellers took one last look at the trees of the oasis bowing to\\nthe force of the hurricane, and soon, catching the wind at two hundred\\nfeet above the ground, disappeared in the gloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-NINTH.\\n\\nSigns of Vegetation.--The Fantastic Notion of a French Author.--A\\nMagnificent Country.--The Kingdom of Adamova.--The Explorations of\\nSpeke and Burton connected with those of Dr. Barth.--The Atlantika\\nMountains.--The River Benoue.--The City of Yola.--The Bagele.--Mount\\nMendif.\\n\\nFrom the moment of their departure, the travellers moved with great\\nvelocity. They longed to leave behind them the desert, which had so\\nnearly been fatal to them.\\n\\nAbout a quarter-past nine in the morning, they caught a glimpse of\\nsome signs of vegetation: herbage floating on that sea of sand, and\\nannouncing, as the weeds upon the ocean did to Christopher Columbus, the\\nnearness of the shore--green shoots peeping up timidly between pebbles\\nthat were, in their turn, to be the rocks of that vast expanse.\\n\\nHills, but of trifling height, were seen in wavy lines upon the horizon.\\nTheir profile, muffled by the heavy mist, was defined but vaguely. The\\nmonotony, however, was beginning to disappear.\\n\\nThe doctor hailed with joy the new country thus disclosed, and, like a\\nseaman on lookout at the mast-head, he was ready to shout aloud:\\n\\n\"Land, ho! land!\"\\n\\nAn hour later the continent spread broadly before their gaze, still wild\\nin aspect, but less flat, less denuded, and with a few trees standing\\nout against the gray sky.\\n\\n\"We are in a civilized country at last!\" said the hunter.\\n\\n\"Civilized? Well, that\\'s one way of speaking; but there are no people to\\nbe seen yet.\"\\n\\n\"It will not be long before we see them,\" said Ferguson, \"at our present\\nrate of travel.\"\\n\\n\"Are we still in the negro country, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and on our way to the country of the Arabs.\"\\n\\n\"What! real Arabs, sir, with their camels?\"\\n\\n\"No, not many camels; they are scarce, if not altogether unknown, in\\nthese regions. We must go a few degrees farther north to see them.\"\\n\\n\"What a pity!\"\\n\\n\"And why, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"Because, if the wind fell contrary, they might be of use to us.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, it\\'s just a notion that\\'s got into my head: we might hitch\\nthem to the car, and make them tow us along. What do you say to that,\\ndoctor?\"\\n\\n\"Poor Joe! Another person had that idea in advance of you. It was used\\nby a very gifted French author--M. Mery--in a romance, it is true. He\\nhas his travellers drawn along in a balloon by a team of camels; then a\\nlion comes up, devours the camels, swallows the tow-rope, and hauls the\\nballoon in their stead; and so on through the story. You see that the\\nwhole thing is the top-flower of fancy, but has nothing in common with\\nour style of locomotion.\"\\n\\nJoe, a little cut down at learning that his idea had been used already,\\ncudgelled his wits to imagine what animal could have devoured the\\nlion; but he could not guess it, and so quietly went on scanning the\\nappearance of the country.\\n\\nA lake of medium extent stretched away before him, surrounded by an\\namphitheatre of hills, which yet could not be dignified with the name of\\nmountains. There were winding valleys, numerous and fertile, with their\\ntangled thickets of the most various trees. The African oil-tree rose\\nabove the mass, with leaves fifteen feet in length upon its stalk,\\nthe latter studded with sharp thorns; the bombax, or silk-cotton-tree,\\nfilled the wind, as it swept by, with the fine down of its seeds; the\\npungent odors of the pendanus, the \"kenda\" of the Arabs, perfumed the\\nair up to the height where the Victoria was sailing; the papaw-tree,\\nwith its palm-shaped leaves; the sterculier, which produces the\\nSoudan-nut; the baobab, and the banana-tree, completed the luxuriant\\nflora of these inter-tropical regions.\\n\\n\"The country is superb!\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"Here are some animals,\" added Joe. \"Men are not far away.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what magnificent elephants!\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"Is there no way to\\nget a little shooting?\"\\n\\n\"How could we manage to halt in a current as strong as this? No, Dick;\\nyou must taste a little of the torture of Tantalus just now. You shall\\nmake up for it afterward.\"\\n\\nAnd, in truth, there was enough to excite the fancy of a sportsman.\\nDick\\'s heart fairly leaped in his breast as he grasped the butt of his\\nPurdy.\\n\\nThe fauna of the region were as striking as its flora. The wild-ox\\nrevelled in dense herbage that often concealed his whole body; gray,\\nblack, and yellow elephants of the most gigantic size burst headlong,\\nlike a living hurricane, through the forests, breaking, rending, tearing\\ndown, devastating every thing in their path; upon the woody slopes of\\nthe hills trickled cascades and springs flowing northward; there, too,\\nthe hippopotami bathed their huge forms, splashing and snorting as they\\nfrolicked in the water, and lamantines, twelve feet long, with bodies\\nlike seals, stretched themselves along the banks, turning up toward the\\nsun their rounded teats swollen with milk.\\n\\nIt was a whole menagerie of rare and curious beasts in a wondrous\\nhot-house, where numberless birds with plumage of a thousand hues\\ngleamed and fluttered in the sunshine.\\n\\nBy this prodigality of Nature, the doctor recognized the splendid\\nkingdom of Adamova.\\n\\n\"We are now beginning to trench upon the realm of modern discovery.\\nI have taken up the lost scent of preceding travellers. It is a happy\\nchance, my friends, for we shall be enabled to link the toils of\\nCaptains Burton and Speke with the explorations of Dr. Barth. We\\nhave left the Englishmen behind us, and now have caught up with the\\nHamburger. It will not be long, either, before we arrive at the extreme\\npoint attained by that daring explorer.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me that there is a vast extent of country between the two\\nexplored routes,\" remarked Kennedy; \"at least, if I am to judge by the\\ndistance that we have made.\"\\n\\n\"It is easy to determine: take the map and see what is the longitude of\\nthe southern point of Lake Ukereoue, reached by Speke.\"\\n\\n\"It is near the thirty-seventh degree.\"\\n\\n\"And the city of Yola, which we shall sight this evening, and to which\\nBarth penetrated, what is its position?\"\\n\\n\"It is about in the twelfth degree of east longitude.\"\\n\\n\"Then there are twenty-five degrees, or, counting sixty miles to each,\\nabout fifteen hundred miles in all.\"\\n\\n\"A nice little walk,\" said Joe, \"for people who have to go on foot.\"\\n\\n\"It will be accomplished, however. Livingstone and Moffat are pushing on\\nup this line toward the interior. Nyassa, which they have discovered,\\nis not far from Lake Tanganayika, seen by Burton. Ere the close of the\\ncentury these regions will, undoubtedly, be explored. But,\" added the\\ndoctor, consulting his compass, \"I regret that the wind is carrying us\\nso far to the westward. I wanted to get to the north.\"\\n\\nAfter twelve hours of progress, the Victoria found herself on the\\nconfines of Nigritia. The first inhabitants of this region, the Chouas\\nArabs, were feeding their wandering flocks. The immense summits of the\\nAtlantika Mountains seen above the horizon--mountains that no European\\nfoot had yet scaled, and whose height is computed to be ten thousand\\nfeet! Their western slope determines the flow of all the waters in this\\nregion of Africa toward the ocean. They are the Mountains of the Moon to\\nthis part of the continent.\\n\\nAt length a real river greeted the gaze of our travellers, and, by\\nthe enormous ant-hills seen in its vicinity, the doctor recognized the\\nBenoue, one of the great tributaries of the Niger, the one which the\\nnatives have called \"The Fountain of the Waters.\"\\n\\n\"This river,\" said the doctor to his companions, \"will, one day, be the\\nnatural channel of communication with the interior of Nigritia. Under\\nthe command of one of our brave captains, the steamer Pleiad has already\\nascended as far as the town of Yola. You see that we are not in an\\nunknown country.\"\\n\\nNumerous slaves were engaged in the labors of the field, cultivating\\nsorgho, a kind of millet which forms the chief basis of their diet; and\\nthe most stupid expressions of astonishment ensued as the Victoria sped\\npast like a meteor. That evening the balloon halted about forty miles\\nfrom Yola, and ahead of it, but in the distance, rose the two sharp\\ncones of Mount Mendif.\\n\\nThe doctor threw out his anchors and made fast to the top of a high\\ntree; but a very violent wind beat upon the balloon with such force as\\nto throw it over on its side, thus rendering the position of the car\\nsometimes extremely dangerous. Ferguson did not close his all night, and\\nhe was repeatedly on the point of cutting the anchor-rope and scudding\\naway before the gale. At length, however, the storm abated, and the\\noscillations of the balloon ceased to be alarming.\\n\\nOn the morrow the wind was more moderate, but it carried our travellers\\naway from the city of Yola, which recently rebuilt by the Fouillans,\\nexcited Ferguson\\'s curiosity. However, he had to make up his mind to\\nbeing borne farther to the northward and even a little to the east.\\n\\nKennedy proposed to halt in this fine hunting-country, and Joe declared\\nthat the need of fresh meat was beginning to be felt; but the savage\\ncustoms of the country, the attitude of the population, and some shots\\nfired at the Victoria, admonished the doctor to continue his journey.\\nThey were then crossing a region that was the scene of massacres and\\nburnings, and where warlike conflicts between the barbarian sultans,\\ncontending for their power amid the most atrocious carnage, never cease.\\n\\nNumerous and populous villages of long low huts stretched away\\nbetween broad pasture-fields whose dense herbage was besprinkled with\\nviolet-colored blossoms. The huts, looking like huge beehives, were\\nsheltered behind bristling palisades. The wild hill-sides and hollows\\nfrequently reminded the beholder of the glens in the Highlands of\\nScotland, as Kennedy more than once remarked.\\n\\nIn spite of all he could do, the doctor bore directly to the northeast,\\ntoward Mount Mendif, which was lost in the midst of environing clouds.\\nThe lofty summits of these mountains separate the valley of the Niger\\nfrom the basin of Lake Tchad.\\n\\nSoon afterward was seen the Bagele, with its eighteen villages clinging\\nto its flanks like a whole brood of children to their mother\\'s bosom--a\\nmagnificent spectacle for the beholder whose gaze commanded and took in\\nthe entire picture at one view. Even the ravines were seen to be covered\\nwith fields of rice and of arachides.\\n\\nBy three o\\'clock the Victoria was directly in front of Mount Mendif. It\\nhad been impossible to avoid it; the only thing to be done was to cross\\nit. The doctor, by means of a temperature increased to one hundred and\\neighty degrees, gave the balloon a fresh ascensional force of nearly\\nsixteen hundred pounds, and it went up to an elevation of more than\\neight thousand feet, the greatest height attained during the journey.\\nThe temperature of the atmosphere was so much cooler at that point that\\nthe aeronauts had to resort to their blankets and thick coverings.\\n\\nFerguson was in haste to descend; the covering of the balloon gave\\nindications of bursting, but in the meanwhile he had time to satisfy\\nhimself of the volcanic origin of the mountain, whose extinct craters\\nare now but deep abysses. Immense accumulations of bird-guano gave the\\nsides of Mount Mendif the appearance of calcareous rocks, and there\\nwas enough of the deposit there to manure all the lands in the United\\nKingdom.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock the Victoria, sheltered from the south winds, went\\ngently gliding along the slopes of the mountain, and stopped in a wide\\nclearing remote from any habitation. The instant it touched the soil,\\nall needful precautions were taken to hold it there firmly; and Kennedy,\\nfowling-piece in hand, sallied out upon the sloping plain. Ere long,\\nhe returned with half a dozen wild ducks and a kind of snipe, which Joe\\nserved up in his best style. The meal was heartily relished, and the\\nnight was passed in undisturbed and refreshing slumber.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTIETH.\\n\\nMosfeia.--The Sheik.--Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney.--Vogel.--The\\nCapital of Loggoum.--Toole.--Becalmed above Kernak.--The Governor and\\nhis Court.--The Attack.--The Incendiary Pigeons.\\n\\nOn the next day, May 11th, the Victoria resumed her adventurous journey.\\nHer passengers had the same confidence in her that a good seaman has in\\nhis ship.\\n\\nIn terrific hurricanes, in tropical heats, when making dangerous\\ndepartures, and descents still more dangerous, it had, at all times\\nand in all places, come out safely. It might almost have been said that\\nFerguson managed it with a wave of the hand; and hence, without knowing\\nin advance, where the point of arrival would be, the doctor had no fears\\nconcerning the successful issue of his journey. However, in this country\\nof barbarians and fanatics, prudence obliged him to take the strictest\\nprecautions. He therefore counselled his companions to have their eyes\\nwide open for every thing and at all hours.\\n\\nThe wind drifted a little more to the northward, and, toward nine\\no\\'clock, they sighted the larger city of Mosfeia, built upon an eminence\\nwhich was itself enclosed between two lofty mountains. Its position\\nwas impregnable, a narrow road running between a marsh and a thick wood\\nbeing the only channel of approach to it.\\n\\nAt the moment of which we write, a sheik, accompanied by a mounted\\nescort, and clad in a garb of brilliant colors, preceded by couriers\\nand trumpeters, who put aside the boughs of the trees as he rode up, was\\nmaking his grand entry into the place.\\n\\nThe doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this\\ncavalcade of natives; but, as the balloon grew larger to their eyes,\\nthey began to show symptoms of intense affright, and at length made off\\nin different directions as fast as their legs and those of their horses\\ncould carry them.\\n\\nThe sheik alone did not budge an inch. He merely grasped his long\\nmusket, cocked it, and proudly waited in silence. The doctor came on to\\nwithin a hundred and fifty feet of him, and then, with his roundest and\\nfullest voice, saluted him courteously in the Arabic tongue.\\n\\nBut, upon hearing these words falling, as it seemed, from the sky, the\\nsheik dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway,\\nwhere the doctor had to leave him, finding it impossible to divert him\\nfrom his adoration.\\n\\n\"Unquestionably,\" Ferguson remarked, \"those people take us for\\nsupernatural beings. When Europeans came among them for the first time,\\nthey were mistaken for creatures of a higher race. When this sheik\\ncomes to speak of to-day\\'s meeting, he will not fail to embellish the\\ncircumstance with all the resources of an Arab imagination. You may,\\ntherefore, judge what an account their legends will give of us some\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"Not such a desirable thing, after all,\" said the Scot, \"in the point of\\nview that affects civilization; it would be better to pass for mere men.\\nThat would give these negro races a superior idea of European power.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, my dear Dick; but what can we do about it? You might sit\\nall day explaining the mechanism of a balloon to the savants of this\\ncountry, and yet they would not comprehend you, but would persist in\\nascribing it to supernatural aid.\"\\n\\n\"Doctor, you spoke of the first time Europeans visited these regions.\\nWho were the visitors?\" inquired Joe.\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, we are now upon the very track of Major Denham. It\\nwas at this very city of Mosfeia that he was received by the Sultan of\\nMandara; he had quitted the Bornou country; he accompanied the sheik in\\nan expedition against the Fellatahs; he assisted in the attack on the\\ncity, which, with its arrows alone, bravely resisted the bullets of the\\nArabs, and put the sheik\\'s troops to flight. All this was but a pretext\\nfor murders, raids, and pillage. The major was completely plundered\\nand stripped, and had it not been for his horse, under whose stomach he\\nclung with the skill of an Indian rider, and was borne with a headlong\\ngallop from his barbarous pursuers, he never could have made his way\\nback to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.\"\\n\\n\"Who was this Major Denham?\"\\n\\n\"A fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an\\nexpedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton\\nand Dr. Oudney. They set out from Tripoli in the month of March, reached\\nMourzouk, the capital of Fez, and, following the route which at a later\\nperiod Dr. Barth was to pursue on his way back to Europe, they arrived,\\non the 16th of February, 1823, at Kouka, near Lake Tchad. Denham made\\nseveral explorations in Bornou, in Mandara, and to the eastern shores\\nof the lake. In the mean time, on the 15th of December, 1823, Captain\\nClapperton and Dr. Oudney had pushed their way through the Soudan\\ncountry as far as Sackatoo, and Oudney died of fatigue and exhaustion in\\nthe town of Murmur.\"\\n\\n\"This part of Africa has, therefore, paid a heavy tribute of victims to\\nthe cause of science,\" said Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Yes, this country is fatal to travellers. We are moving directly toward\\nthe kingdom of Baghirmi, which Vogel traversed in 1856, so as to reach\\nthe Wadai country, where he disappeared. This young man, at the age of\\ntwenty-three, had been sent to cooperate with Dr. Barth. They met on the\\n1st of December, 1854, and thereupon commenced his explorations of the\\ncountry. Toward 1856, he announced, in the last letters received\\nfrom him, his intention to reconnoitre the kingdom of Wadai, which no\\nEuropean had yet penetrated. It appears that he got as far as Wara, the\\ncapital, where, according to some accounts, he was made prisoner, and,\\naccording to others, was put to death for having attempted to ascend a\\nsacred mountain in the environs. But, we must not too lightly admit the\\ndeath of travellers, since that does away with the necessity of going\\nin search of them. For instance, how often was the death of Dr. Barth\\nreported, to his own great annoyance! It is, therefore, very possible\\nthat Vogel may still be held as a prisoner by the Sultan of Wadai, in\\nthe hope of obtaining a good ransom for him.\\n\\n\"Baron de Neimans was about starting for the Wadai country when he\\ndied at Cairo, in 1855; and we now know that De Heuglin has set out on\\nVogel\\'s track with the expedition sent from Leipsic, so that we shall\\nsoon be accurately informed as to the fate of that young and interesting\\nexplorer.\"*\\n\\n     * Since the doctor\\'s departure, letters written from\\n     El\\'Obeid by Mr. Muntzinger, the newly-appointed head of the\\n     expedition, unfortunately place the death of Vogel beyond a\\n     doubt.\\n\\nMosfeia had disappeared from the horizon long ere this, and the Mandara\\ncountry was developing to the gaze of our aeronauts its astonishing\\nfertility, with its forests of acacias, its locust-trees covered with\\nred flowers, and the herbaceous plants of its fields of cotton and\\nindigo trees. The river Shari, which eighty miles farther on rolled its\\nimpetuous waters into Lake Tchad, was quite distinctly seen.\\n\\nThe doctor got his companions to trace its course upon the maps drawn by\\nDr. Barth.\\n\\n\"You perceive,\" said he, \"that the labors of this savant have been\\nconducted with great precision; we are moving directly toward the\\nLoggoum region, and perhaps toward Kernak, its capital. It was there\\nthat poor Toole died, at the age of scarcely twenty-two. He was a young\\nEnglishman, an ensign in the 80th regiment, who, a few weeks before, had\\njoined Major Denham in Africa, and it was not long ere he there met\\nhis death. Ah! this vast country might well be called the graveyard of\\nEuropean travellers.\"\\n\\nSome boats, fifty feet long, were descending the current of the Shari.\\nThe Victoria, then one thousand feet above the soil, hardly attracted\\nthe attention of the natives; but the wind, which until then had been\\nblowing with a certain degree of strength, was falling off.\\n\\n\"Is it possible that we are to be caught in another dead calm?\" sighed\\nthe doctor.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve no lack of water, nor the desert to fear, anyhow, master,\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\\n\"No; but there are races here still more to be dreaded.\"\\n\\n\"Why!\" said Joe, again, \"there\\'s something like a town.\"\\n\\n\"That is Kernak. The last puffs of the breeze are wafting us to it, and,\\nif we choose, we can take an exact plan of the place.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we not go nearer to it?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Nothing easier, Dick! We are right over it. Allow me to turn the\\nstopcock of the cylinder, and we\\'ll not be long in descending.\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later the balloon hung motionless about two hundred feet\\nfrom the ground.\\n\\n\"Here we are!\" said the doctor, \"nearer to Kernak than a man would be to\\nLondon, if he were perched in the cupola of St. Paul\\'s. So we can take a\\nsurvey at our ease.\"\\n\\n\"What is that tick-tacking sound that we hear on all sides?\"\\n\\nJoe looked attentively, and at length discovered that the noise they\\nheard was produced by a number of weavers beating cloth stretched in the\\nopen air, on large trunks of trees.\\n\\nThe capital of Loggoum could then be seen in its entire extent, like\\nan unrolled chart. It is really a city with straight rows of houses\\nand quite wide streets. In the midst of a large open space there was a\\nslave-market, attended by a great crowd of customers, for the Mandara\\nwomen, who have extremely small hands and feet, are in excellent\\nrequest, and can be sold at lucrative rates.\\n\\nAt the sight of the Victoria, the scene so often produced occurred\\nagain. At first there were outcries, and then followed general\\nstupefaction; business was abandoned; work was flung aside, and\\nall noise ceased. The aeronauts remained as they were, completely\\nmotionless, and lost not a detail of the populous city. They even went\\ndown to within sixty feet of the ground.\\n\\nHereupon the Governor of Loggoum came out from his residence, displaying\\nhis green standard, and accompanied by his musicians, who blew on hoarse\\nbuffalo-horns, as though they would split their cheeks or any thing\\nelse, excepting their own lungs. The crowd at once gathered around him.\\nIn the mean while Dr. Ferguson tried to make himself heard, but in vain.\\n\\nThis population looked like proud and intelligent people, with their\\nhigh foreheads, their almost aquiline noses, and their curling hair; but\\nthe presence of the Victoria troubled them greatly. Horsemen could be\\nseen galloping in all directions, and it soon became evident that the\\ngovernor\\'s troops were assembling to oppose so extraordinary a foe. Joe\\nwore himself out waving handkerchiefs of every color and shape to them;\\nbut his exertions were all to no purpose.\\n\\nHowever, the sheik, surrounded by his court, proclaimed silence, and\\npronounced a discourse, of which the doctor could not understand a word.\\nIt was Arabic, mixed with Baghirmi. He could make out enough, however,\\nby the universal language of gestures, to be aware that he was receiving\\na very polite invitation to depart. Indeed, he would have asked for\\nnothing better, but for lack of wind, the thing had become impossible.\\nHis noncompliance, therefore, exasperated the governor, whose courtiers\\nand attendants set up a furious howl to enforce immediate obedience on\\nthe part of the aerial monster.\\n\\nThey were odd-looking fellows those courtiers, with their five or six\\nshirts swathed around their bodies! They had enormous stomachs, some\\nof which actually seemed to be artificial. The doctor surprised his\\ncompanions by informing them that this was the way to pay court to\\nthe sultan. The rotundity of the stomach indicated the ambition of its\\npossessor. These corpulent gentry gesticulated and bawled at the top of\\ntheir voices--one of them particularly distinguishing himself above\\nthe rest--to such an extent, indeed, that he must have been a prime\\nminister--at least, if the disturbance he made was any criterion of his\\nrank. The common rabble of dusky denizens united their howlings with\\nthe uproar of the court, repeating their gesticulations like so many\\nmonkeys, and thereby producing a single and instantaneous movement of\\nten thousand arms at one time.\\n\\nTo these means of intimidation, which were presently deemed\\ninsufficient, were added others still more formidable. Soldiers, armed\\nwith bows and arrows, were drawn up in line of battle; but by this time\\nthe balloon was expanding, and rising quietly beyond their reach. Upon\\nthis the governor seized a musket and aimed it at the balloon; but,\\nKennedy, who was watching him, shattered the uplifted weapon in the\\nsheik\\'s grasp.\\n\\nAt this unexpected blow there was a general rout. Every mother\\'s son\\nof them scampered for his dwelling with the utmost celerity, and stayed\\nthere, so that the streets of the town were absolutely deserted for the\\nremainder of that day.\\n\\nNight came, and not a breath of wind was stirring. The aeronauts had to\\nmake up their minds to remain motionless at the distance of but three\\nhundred feet above the ground. Not a fire or light shone in the deep\\ngloom, and around reigned the silence of death; but the doctor only\\nredoubled his vigilance, as this apparent quiet might conceal some\\nsnare.\\n\\nAnd he had reason to be watchful. About midnight, the whole city seemed\\nto be in a blaze. Hundreds of streaks of flame crossed each other, and\\nshot to and fro in the air like rockets, forming a regular network of\\nfire.\\n\\n\"That\\'s really curious!\" said the doctor, somewhat puzzled to make out\\nwhat it meant.\\n\\n\"By all that\\'s glorious!\" shouted Kennedy, \"it looks as if the fire were\\nascending and coming up toward us!\"\\n\\nAnd, sure enough, with an accompaniment of musket-shots, yelling, and\\ndin of every description, the mass of fire was, indeed, mounting toward\\nthe Victoria. Joe got ready to throw out ballast, and Ferguson was not\\nlong at guessing the truth. Thousands of pigeons, their tails garnished\\nwith combustibles, had been set loose and driven toward the Victoria;\\nand now, in their terror, they were flying high up, zigzagging the\\natmosphere with lines of fire. Kennedy was preparing to discharge all\\nhis batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could\\nhe have done against such a numberless army? The pigeons were already\\nwhisking around the car; they were even surrounding the balloon,\\nthe sides of which, reflecting their illumination, looked as though\\nenveloped with a network of fire.\\n\\nThe doctor dared hesitate no longer; and, throwing out a fragment of\\nquartz, he kept himself beyond the reach of these dangerous assailants;\\nand, for two hours afterward, he could see them wandering hither and\\nthither through the darkness of the night, until, little by little,\\ntheir light diminished, and they, one by one, died out.\\n\\n\"Now we may sleep in quiet,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n\"Not badly got up for barbarians,\" mused friend Joe, speaking his\\nthoughts aloud.\\n\\n\"Oh, they employ these pigeons frequently, to set fire to the thatch\\nof hostile villages; but this time the village mounted higher than they\\ncould go.\"\\n\\n\"Why, positively, a balloon need fear no enemies!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed, it may!\" objected Ferguson.\\n\\n\"What are they, then, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"They are the careless people in the car! So, my friends, let us have\\nvigilance in all places and at all times.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIRST.\\n\\nDeparture in the Night-time.--All Three.--Kennedy\\'s\\nInstincts.--Precautions.--The Course of the Shari River.--Lake\\nTchad.--The Water of the Lake.--The Hippopotamus.--One Bullet thrown\\naway.\\n\\nAbout three o\\'clock in the morning, Joe, who was then on watch, at\\nlength saw the city move away from beneath his feet. The Victoria was\\nonce again in motion, and both the doctor and Kennedy awoke.\\n\\nThe former consulted his compass, and saw, with satisfaction, that the\\nwind was carrying them toward the north-northeast.\\n\\n\"We are in luck!\" said he; \"every thing works in our favor: we shall\\ndiscover Lake Tchad this very day.\"\\n\\n\"Is it a broad sheet of water?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Somewhat, Dick. At its greatest length and breadth, it measures about\\none hundred and twenty miles.\"\\n\\n\"It will spice our trip with a little variety to sail over a spacious\\nsheet of water.\"\\n\\n\"After all, though, I don\\'t see that we have much to complain of on that\\nscore. Our trip has been very much varied, indeed; and, moreover, we are\\ngetting on under the best possible conditions.\"\\n\\n\"Unquestionably so; excepting those privations on the desert, we have\\nencountered no serious danger.\"\\n\\n\"It is not to be denied that our noble balloon has behaved wonderfully\\nwell. To-day is May 12th, and we started on the 18th of April. That\\nmakes twenty-five days of journeying. In ten days more we shall have\\nreached our destination.\"\\n\\n\"Where is that?\"\\n\\n\"I do not know. But what does that signify?\"\\n\\n\"You are right again, Samuel! Let us intrust to Providence the care of\\nguiding us and of keeping us in good health as we are now. We don\\'t look\\nmuch as though we had been crossing the most pestilential country in the\\nworld!\"\\n\\n\"We had an opportunity of getting up in life, and that\\'s what we have\\ndone!\"\\n\\n\"Hurrah for trips in the air!\" cried Joe. \"Here we are at the end of\\ntwenty-five days in good condition, well fed, and well rested. We\\'ve had\\ntoo much rest in fact, for my legs begin to feel rusty, and I wouldn\\'t\\nbe vexed a bit to stretch them with a run of thirty miles or so!\"\\n\\n\"You can do that, Joe, in the streets of London, but in fine we set\\nout three together, like Denham, Clapperton, and Overweg; like Barth,\\nRichardson, and Vogel, and, more fortunate than our predecessors here,\\nwe are three in number still. But it is most important for us not to\\nseparate. If, while one of us was on the ground, the Victoria should\\nhave to ascend in order to escape some sudden danger, who knows whether\\nwe should ever see each other again? Therefore it is that I say again to\\nKennedy frankly that I do not like his going off alone to hunt.\"\\n\\n\"But still, Samuel, you will permit me to indulge that fancy a little.\\nThere is no harm in renewing our stock of provisions. Besides, before\\nour departure, you held out to me the prospect of some superb hunting,\\nand thus far I have done but little in the line of the Andersons and\\nCummings.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear Dick, your memory fails you, or your modesty makes you\\nforget your own exploits. It really seems to me that, without mentioning\\nsmall game, you have already an antelope, an elephant, and two lions on\\nyour conscience.\"\\n\\n\"But what\\'s all that to an African sportsman who sees all the animals\\nin creation strutting along under the muzzle of his rifle? There! there!\\nlook at that troop of giraffes!\"\\n\\n\"Those giraffes,\" roared Joe; \"why, they\\'re not as big as my fist.\"\\n\\n\"Because we are a thousand feet above them; but close to them you would\\ndiscover that they are three times as tall as you are!\"\\n\\n\"And what do you say to yon herd of gazelles, and those ostriches, that\\nrun with the speed of the wind?\" resumed Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Those ostriches?\" remonstrated Joe, again; \"those are chickens, and the\\ngreatest kind of chickens!\"\\n\\n\"Come, doctor, can\\'t we get down nearer to them?\" pleaded Kennedy.\\n\\n\"We can get closer to them, Dick, but we must not land. And what good\\nwill it do you to strike down those poor animals when they can be of no\\nuse to you? Now, if the question were to destroy a lion, a tiger, a cat,\\na hyena, I could understand it; but to deprive an antelope or a gazelle\\nof life, to no other purpose than the gratification of your instincts as\\na sportsman, seems hardly worth the trouble. But, after all, my friend,\\nwe are going to keep at about one hundred feet only from the soil, and,\\nshould you see any ferocious wild beast, oblige us by sending a ball\\nthrough its heart!\"\\n\\nThe Victoria descended gradually, but still keeping at a safe height,\\nfor, in a barbarous, yet very populous country, it was necessary to keep\\non the watch for unexpected perils.\\n\\nThe travellers were then directly following the course of the Shari. The\\ncharming banks of this river were hidden beneath the foliage of trees of\\nvarious dyes; lianas and climbing plants wound in and out on all sides\\nand formed the most curious combinations of color. Crocodiles were seen\\nbasking in the broad blaze of the sun or plunging beneath the waters\\nwith the agility of lizards, and in their gambols they sported about\\namong the many green islands that intercept the current of the stream.\\n\\nIt was thus, in the midst of rich and verdant landscapes that our\\ntravellers passed over the district of Maffatay, and about nine o\\'clock\\nin the morning reached the southern shore of Lake Tchad.\\n\\nThere it was at last, outstretched before them, that Caspian Sea of\\nAfrica, the existence of which was so long consigned to the realms of\\nfable--that interior expanse of water to which only Denham\\'s and Barth\\'s\\nexpeditions had been able to force their way.\\n\\nThe doctor strove in vain to fix its precise configuration upon paper.\\nIt had already changed greatly since 1847. In fact, the chart of Lake\\nTchad is very difficult to trace with exactitude, for it is surrounded\\nby muddy and almost impassable morasses, in which Barth thought that\\nhe was doomed to perish. From year to year these marshes, covered with\\nreeds and papyrus fifteen feet high, become the lake itself. Frequently,\\ntoo, the villages on its shores are half submerged, as was the case with\\nNgornou in 1856, and now the hippopotamus and the alligator frisk and\\ndive where the dwellings of Bornou once stood.\\n\\nThe sun shot his dazzling rays over this placid sheet of water, and\\ntoward the north the two elements merged into one and the same horizon.\\n\\nThe doctor was desirous of determining the character of the water, which\\nwas long believed to be salt. There was no danger in descending close to\\nthe lake, and the car was soon skimming its surface like a bird at the\\ndistance of only five feet.\\n\\nJoe plunged a bottle into the lake and drew it up half filled. The water\\nwas then tasted and found to be but little fit for drinking, with a\\ncertain carbonate-of-soda flavor.\\n\\nWhile the doctor was jotting down the result of this experiment, the\\nloud report of a gun was heard close beside him. Kennedy had not been\\nable to resist the temptation of firing at a huge hippopotamus. The\\nlatter, who had been basking quietly, disappeared at the sound of the\\nexplosion, but did not seem to be otherwise incommoded by Kennedy\\'s\\nconical bullet.\\n\\n\"You\\'d have done better if you had harpooned him,\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"But how?\"\\n\\n\"With one of our anchors. It would have been a hook just big enough for\\nsuch a rousing beast as that!\"\\n\\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Kennedy, \"Joe really has an idea this time--\"\\n\\n\"Which I beg of you not to put into execution,\" interposed the doctor.\\n\"The animal would very quickly have dragged us where we could not have\\ndone much to help ourselves, and where we have no business to be.\"\\n\\n\"Especially now since we\\'ve settled the question as to what kind of\\nwater there is in Lake Tchad. Is that sort of fish good to eat, Dr.\\nFerguson?\"\\n\\n\"That fish, as you call it, Joe, is really a mammiferous animal of the\\npachydermal species. Its flesh is said to be excellent and is an article\\nof important trade between the tribes living along the borders of the\\nlake.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'m sorry that Mr. Kennedy\\'s shot didn\\'t do more damage.\"\\n\\n\"The animal is vulnerable only in the stomach and between the thighs.\\nDick\\'s ball hasn\\'t even marked him; but should the ground strike me as\\nfavorable, we shall halt at the northern end of the lake, where Kennedy\\nwill find himself in the midst of a whole menagerie, and can make up for\\nlost time.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Joe, \"I hope then that Mr. Kennedy will hunt the\\nhippopotamus a little; I\\'d like to taste the meat of that queer-looking\\nbeast. It doesn\\'t look exactly natural to get away into the centre of\\nAfrica, to feed on snipe and partridge, just as if we were in England.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SECOND.\\n\\nThe Capital of Bornou.--The Islands of the Biddiomahs.--The\\nCondors.--The Doctor\\'s Anxieties.--His Precautions.--An Attack\\nin Mid-air.--The Balloon Covering torn.--The Fall.--Sublime\\nSelf-Sacrifice.--The Northern Coast of the Lake.\\n\\nSince its arrival at Lake Tchad, the balloon had struck a current that\\nedged it farther to the westward. A few clouds tempered the heat of the\\nday, and, besides, a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of\\nwater; but about one o\\'clock, the Victoria, having slanted across this\\npart of the lake, again advanced over the land for a space of seven or\\neight miles.\\n\\nThe doctor, who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course,\\nno longer thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of\\nKouka, the capital of Bornou. He saw it for a moment, encircled by\\nits walls of white clay, and a few rudely-constructed mosques\\nrising clumsily above that conglomeration of houses that look like\\nplaying-dice, which form most Arab towns. In the court-yards of\\nthe private dwellings, and on the public squares, grew palms and\\ncaoutchouc-trees topped with a dome of foliage more than one hundred\\nfeet in breadth. Joe called attention to the fact that these immense\\nparasols were in proper accordance with the intense heat of the sun, and\\nmade thereon some pious reflections which it were needless to repeat.\\n\\nKouka really consists of two distinct towns, separated by the \"Dendal,\"\\na large boulevard three hundred yards wide, at that hour crowded with\\nhorsemen and foot passengers. On one side, the rich quarter stands\\nsquarely with its airy and lofty houses, laid out in regular order; on\\nthe other, is huddled together the poor quarter, a miserable collection\\nof low hovels of a conical shape, in which a poverty-stricken multitude\\nvegetate rather than live, since Kouka is neither a trading nor a\\ncommercial city.\\n\\nKennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh, were that city\\nextended on a plain, with its two distinct boroughs.\\n\\nBut our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of\\nit, for, with the fickleness that characterizes the air-currents of this\\nregion, a contrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the\\nsurface of Lake Tchad.\\n\\nThen then were regaled with a new spectacle. They could count the\\nnumerous islets of the lake, inhabited by the Biddiomahs, a race of\\nbloodthirsty and formidable pirates, who are as greatly feared when\\nneighbors as are the Touaregs of Sahara.\\n\\nThese estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely\\nwith stones and arrows, but the balloon quickly passed their islands,\\nfluttering over them, from one to the other with butterfly motion, like\\na gigantic beetle.\\n\\nAt this moment, Joe, who was scanning the horizon, said to Kennedy:\\n\\n\"There, sir, as you are always thinking of good sport, yonder is just\\nthe thing for you!\"\\n\\n\"What is it, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"This time, the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting.\"\\n\\n\"But what is it?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see that flock of big birds making for us?\"\\n\\n\"Birds?\" exclaimed the doctor, snatching his spyglass.\\n\\n\"I see them,\" replied Kennedy; \"there are at least a dozen of them.\"\\n\\n\"Fourteen, exactly!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Heaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the\\ndoctor to let me peg away at them!\"\\n\\n\"I should not object, but I would much rather see those birds at a\\ndistance from us!\"\\n\\n\"Why, are you afraid of those fowls?\"\\n\\n\"They are condors, and of the largest size. Should they attack us--\"\\n\\n\"Well, if they do, we\\'ll defend ourselves. We have a whole arsenal at\\nour disposal. I don\\'t think those birds are so very formidable.\"\\n\\n\"Who can tell?\" was the doctor\\'s only remark.\\n\\nTen minutes later, the flock had come within gunshot, and were making\\nthe air ring with their hoarse cries. They came right toward the\\nVictoria, more irritated than frightened by her presence.\\n\\n\"How they scream! What a noise!\" said Joe.\\n\\n\"Perhaps they don\\'t like to see anybody poaching in their country up in\\nthe air, or daring to fly like themselves!\"\\n\\n\"Well, now, to tell the truth, when I take a good look at them, they are\\nan ugly, ferocious set, and I should think them dangerous enough if they\\nwere armed with Purdy-Moore rifles,\" admitted Kennedy.\\n\\n\"They have no need of such weapons,\" said Ferguson, looking very grave.\\n\\nThe condors flew around them in wide circles, their flight growing\\ngradually closer and closer to the balloon. They swept through the\\nair in rapid, fantastic curves, occasionally precipitating themselves\\nheadlong with the speed of a bullet, and then breaking their line of\\nprojection by an abrupt and daring angle.\\n\\nThe doctor, much disquieted, resolved to ascend so as to escape this\\ndangerous proximity. He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon,\\nand it rapidly rose.\\n\\nBut the condors mounted with him, apparently determined not to part\\ncompany.\\n\\n\"They seem to mean mischief!\" said the hunter, cocking his rifle.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, they were swooping nearer, and more than one came within\\nfifty feet of them, as if defying the fire-arms.\\n\\n\"By George, I\\'m itching to let them have it!\" exclaimed Kennedy.\\n\\n\"No, Dick; not now! Don\\'t exasperate them needlessly. That would only be\\nexciting them to attack us!\"\\n\\n\"But I could soon settle those fellows!\"\\n\\n\"You may think so, Dick. But you are wrong!\"\\n\\n\"Why, we have a bullet for each of them!\"\\n\\n\"And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon,\\nwhat would you do? How would you get at them? Just imagine yourself in\\nthe presence of a troop of lions on the plain, or a school of sharks\\nin the open ocean! For travellers in the air, this situation is just as\\ndangerous.\"\\n\\n\"Are you speaking seriously, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Very seriously, Dick.\"\\n\\n\"Let us wait, then!\"\\n\\n\"Wait! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack, but do not fire\\nwithout my orders.\"\\n\\nThe birds then collected at a short distance, yet to near that their\\nnaked necks, entirely bare of feathers, could be plainly seen, as they\\nstretched them out with the effort of their cries, while their gristly\\ncrests, garnished with a comb and gills of deep violet, stood erect with\\nrage. They were of the very largest size, their bodies being more\\nthan three feet in length, and the lower surface of their white wings\\nglittering in the sunlight. They might well have been considered winged\\nsharks, so striking was their resemblance to those ferocious rangers of\\nthe deep.\\n\\n\"They are following us!\" said the doctor, as he saw them ascending with\\nhim, \"and, mount as we may, they can fly still higher!\"\\n\\n\"Well, what are we to do?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\nThe doctor made no answer.\\n\\n\"Listen, Samuel!\" said the sportsman. \"There are fourteen of those\\nbirds; we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our\\nweapons. Have we not the means, then, to destroy them or disperse them?\\nI will give a good account of some of them!\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of your skill, Dick; I look upon all as dead that may\\ncome within range of your rifle, but I repeat that, if they attack the\\nupper part of the balloon, you could not get a sight at them. They would\\ntear the silk covering that sustains us, and we are three thousand feet\\nup in the air!\"\\n\\nAt this moment, one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon,\\nwith outstretched beak and claws, ready to rend it with either or both.\\n\\n\"Fire! fire at once!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\nHe had scarcely ceased, ere the huge creature, stricken dead, dropped\\nheadlong, turning over and over in space as he fell.\\n\\nKennedy had already grasped one of the two-barrelled fowling-pieces and\\nJoe was taking aim with another.\\n\\nFrightened by the report, the condors drew back for a moment, but they\\nalmost instantly returned to the charge with extreme fury. Kennedy\\nsevered the head of one from its body with his first shot, and Joe broke\\nthe wing of another.\\n\\n\"Only eleven left,\" said he.\\n\\nThereupon the birds changed their tactics, and by common consent soared\\nabove the balloon. Kennedy glanced at Ferguson. The latter, in spite\\nof his imperturbability, grew pale. Then ensued a moment of terrifying\\nsilence. In the next they heard a harsh tearing noise, as of something\\nrending the silk, and the car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of\\nour three aeronauts.\\n\\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Ferguson, glancing at the barometer, which was\\nnow swiftly rising.\\n\\n\"Over with the ballast!\" he shouted, \"over with it!\"\\n\\nAnd in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared.\\n\\n\"We are still falling! Empty the water-tanks! Do you hear me, Joe? We\\nare pitching into the lake!\"\\n\\nJoe obeyed. The doctor leaned over and looked out. The lake seemed to\\ncome up toward him like a rising tide. Every object around grew rapidly\\nin size while they were looking at it. The car was not two hundred feet\\nfrom the surface of Lake Tchad.\\n\\n\"The provisions! the provisions!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\nAnd the box containing them was launched into space.\\n\\nTheir descent became less rapid, but the luckless aeronauts were still\\nfalling, and into the lake.\\n\\n\"Throw out something--something more!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\n\"There is nothing more to throw!\" was Kennedy\\'s despairing response.\\n\\n\"Yes, there is!\" called Joe, and with a wave of the hand he disappeared\\nlike a flash, over the edge of the car.\\n\\n\"Joe! Joe!\" exclaimed the doctor, horror-stricken.\\n\\nThe Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion, mounted\\na thousand feet into the air, and the wind, burying itself in the\\ndisinflated covering, bore them away toward the northern part of the\\nlake.\\n\\n\"Lost!\" exclaimed the sportsman, with a gesture of despair.\\n\\n\"Lost to save us!\" responded Ferguson.\\n\\nAnd these men, intrepid as they were, felt the large tears streaming\\ndown their cheeks. They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some\\ntrace of their heroic companion, but they were already far away from\\nhim.\\n\\n\"What course shall we pursue?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Alight as soon as possible, Dick, and then wait.\"\\n\\nAfter a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore,\\non the north of the lake. The anchors caught in a low tree and the\\nsportsman fastened it securely. Night came, but neither Ferguson nor\\nKennedy could find one moment\\'s sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-THIRD.\\n\\nConjectures.--Reestablishment of the Victoria\\'s Equilibrium.--Dr.\\nFerguson\\'s New Calculations.--Kennedy\\'s Hunt.--A Complete Exploration of\\nLake Tchad.--Tangalia.--The Return.--Lari.\\n\\nOn the morrow, the 13th of May, our travellers, for the first time,\\nreconnoitred the part of the coast on which they had landed. It was a\\nsort of island of solid ground in the midst of an immense marsh. Around\\nthis fragment of terra firma grew reeds as lofty as trees are in Europe,\\nand stretching away out of sight.\\n\\nThese impenetrable swamps gave security to the position of the balloon.\\nIt was necessary to watch only the borders of the lake. The vast stretch\\nof water broadened away from the spot, especially toward the east, and\\nnothing could be seen on the horizon, neither mainland nor islands.\\n\\nThe two friends had not yet ventured to speak of their recent companion.\\nKennedy first imparted his conjectures to the doctor.\\n\\n\"Perhaps Joe is not lost after all,\" he said. \"He was a skilful lad,\\nand had few equals as a swimmer. He would find no difficulty in swimming\\nacross the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh. We shall see him again--but how\\nand where I know not. Let us omit nothing on our part to give him the\\nchance of rejoining us.\"\\n\\n\"May God grant it as you say, Dick!\" replied the doctor, with much\\nemotion. \"We shall do everything in the world to find our lost friend\\nagain. Let us, in the first place, see where we are. But, above all\\nthings, let us rid the Victoria of this outside covering, which is of\\nno further use. That will relieve us of six hundred and fifty pounds, a\\nweight not to be despised--and the end is worth the trouble!\"\\n\\nThe doctor and Kennedy went to work at once, but they encountered great\\ndifficulty. They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece, and\\nthen cut it in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of\\nthe network. The tear made by the beaks of the condors was found to be\\nseveral feet in length.\\n\\nThis operation took at least four hours, but at length the inner balloon\\nonce completely extricated did not appear to have suffered in the least\\ndegree. The Victoria was thus diminished in size by one fifth, and this\\ndifference was sufficiently noticeable to excite Kennedy\\'s surprise.\\n\\n\"Will it be large enough?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Have no fears on that score, I will reestablish the equilibrium, and\\nshould our poor Joe return we shall find a way to start off with him\\nagain on our old route.\"\\n\\n\"At the moment of our fall, unless I am mistaken, we were not far from\\nan island.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I recollect it,\" said the doctor, \"but that island, like all the\\nislands on Lake Tchad, is, no doubt, inhabited by a gang of pirates and\\nmurderers. They certainly witnessed our misfortune, and should Joe fall\\ninto their hands, what will become of him unless protected by their\\nsuperstitions?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s just the lad to get safely out of the scrape, I repeat. I have\\ngreat confidence in his shrewdness and skill.\"\\n\\n\"I hope so. Now, Dick, you may go and hunt in the neighborhood, but\\ndon\\'t get far away whatever you do. It has become a pressing necessity\\nfor us to renew our stock of provisions, since we had to sacrifice\\nnearly all the old lot.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, doctor, I shall not be long absent.\"\\n\\nHereupon, Kennedy took a double-barrelled fowling-piece, and strode\\nthrough the long grass toward a thicket not far off, where the frequent\\nsound of shooting soon let the doctor know that the sportsman was making\\na good use of his time.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ferguson was engaged in calculating the relative weight of the\\narticles still left in the car, and in establishing the equipoise of the\\nsecond balloon. He found that there were still left some thirty pounds\\nof pemmican, a supply of tea and coffee, about a gallon and a half of\\nbrandy, and one empty water-tank. All the dried meat had disappeared.\\n\\nThe doctor was aware that, by the loss of the hydrogen in the first\\nballoon, the ascensional force at his disposal was now reduced to about\\nnine hundred pounds. He therefore had to count upon this difference in\\norder to rearrange his equilibrium. The new balloon measured sixty-seven\\nthousand cubic feet, and contained thirty-three thousand four hundred\\nand eighty feet of gas. The dilating apparatus appeared to be in good\\ncondition, and neither the battery nor the spiral had been injured.\\n\\nThe ascensional force of the new balloon was then about three thousand\\npounds, and, in adding together the weight of the apparatus, of the\\npassengers, of the stock of water, of the car and its accessories, and\\nputting aboard fifty gallons of water, and one hundred pounds of fresh\\nmeat, the doctor got a total weight of twenty-eight hundred and thirty\\npounds. He could then take with him one hundred and seventy pounds of\\nballast, for unforeseen emergencies, and the balloon would be in exact\\nbalance with the surrounding atmosphere.\\n\\nHis arrangements were completed accordingly, and he made up for Joe\\'s\\nweight with a surplus of ballast. He spent the whole day in these\\npreparations, and the latter were finished when Kennedy returned. The\\nhunter had been successful, and brought back a regular cargo of geese,\\nwild-duck, snipe, teal, and plover. He went to work at once to draw and\\nsmoke the game. Each piece, suspended on a small, thin skewer, was hung\\nover a fire of green wood. When they seemed in good order, Kennedy, who\\nwas perfectly at home in the business, packed them away in the car.\\n\\nOn the morrow, the hunter was to complete his supplies.\\n\\nEvening surprised our travellers in the midst of this work. Their supper\\nconsisted of pemmican, biscuit, and tea; and fatigue, after having given\\nthem appetite, brought them sleep. Each of them strained eyes and ears\\ninto the gloom during his watch, sometimes fancying that they heard the\\nvoice of poor Joe; but, alas! the voice that they so longed to hear, was\\nfar away.\\n\\n\"At the first streak of day, the doctor aroused Kennedy.\\n\\n\"I have been long and carefully considering what should be done,\" said\\nhe, \"to find our companion.\"\\n\\n\"Whatever your plan may be, doctor, it will suit me. Speak!\"\\n\\n\"Above all things, it is important that Joe should hear from us in some\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that\\nwe have abandoned him?\"\\n\\n\"He! He knows us too well for that. Such a thought would never come into\\nhis mind. But he must be informed as to where we are.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be managed?\"\\n\\n\"We shall get into our car and be off again through the air.\"\\n\\n\"But, should the wind bear us away?\"\\n\\n\"Happily, it will not. See, Dick! it is carrying us back to the lake;\\nand this circumstance, which would have been vexatious yesterday, is\\nfortunate now. Our efforts, then, will be limited to keeping ourselves\\nabove that vast sheet of water throughout the day. Joe cannot fail\\nto see us, and his eyes will be constantly on the lookout in that\\ndirection. Perhaps he will even manage to let us know the place of his\\nretreat.\"\\n\\n\"If he be alone and at liberty, he certainly will.\"\\n\\n\"And if a prisoner,\" resumed the doctor, \"it not being the practice of\\nthe natives to confine their captives, he will see us, and comprehend\\nthe object of our researches.\"\\n\\n\"But, at last,\" put in Kennedy--\"for we must anticipate every\\nthing--should we find no trace--if he should have left no mark to follow\\nhim by, what are we to do?\"\\n\\n\"We shall endeavor to regain the northern part of the lake, keeping\\nourselves as much in sight as possible. There we\\'ll wait; we\\'ll explore\\nthe banks; we\\'ll search the water\\'s edge, for Joe will assuredly try to\\nreach the shore; and we will not leave the country without having done\\nevery thing to find him.\"\\n\\n\"Let us set out, then!\" said the hunter.\\n\\nThe doctor hereupon took the exact bearings of the patch of solid land\\nthey were about to leave, and arrived at the conclusion that it lay\\non the north shore of Lake Tchad, between the village of Lari and the\\nvillage of Ingemini, both visited by Major Denham. During this time\\nKennedy was completing his stock of fresh meat. Although the neighboring\\nmarshes showed traces of the rhinoceros, the lamantine (or manatee),\\nand the hippopotamus, he had no opportunity to see a single specimen of\\nthose animals.\\n\\nAt seven in the morning, but not without great difficulty--which to\\nJoe would have been nothing--the balloon\\'s anchor was detached from its\\nhold, the gas dilated, and the new Victoria rose two hundred feet into\\nthe air. It seemed to hesitate at first, and went spinning around, like\\na top; but at last a brisk current caught it, and it advanced over the\\nlake, and was soon borne away at a speed of twenty miles per hour.\\n\\nThe doctor continued to keep at a height of from two hundred to five\\nhundred feet. Kennedy frequently discharged his rifle; and, when\\npassing over islands, the aeronauts approached them even imprudently,\\nscrutinizing the thickets, the bushes, the underbrush--in fine, every\\nspot where a mass of shade or jutting rock could have afforded a retreat\\nto their companion. They swooped down close to the long pirogues that\\nnavigated the lake; and the wild fishermen, terrified at the sight of\\nthe balloon, would plunge into the water and regain their islands with\\nevery symptom of undisguised affright.\\n\\n\"We can see nothing,\" said Kennedy, after two hours of search.\\n\\n\"Let us wait a little longer, Dick, and not lose heart. We cannot be far\\naway from the scene of our accident.\"\\n\\nBy eleven o\\'clock the balloon had gone ninety miles. It then fell in\\nwith a new current, which, blowing almost at right angles to the other,\\ndrove them eastward about sixty miles. It next floated over a very large\\nand populous island, which the doctor took to be Farram, on which the\\ncapital of the Biddiomahs is situated. Ferguson expected at every moment\\nto see Joe spring up out of some thicket, flying for his life, and\\ncalling for help. Were he free, they could pick him up without trouble;\\nwere he a prisoner, they could rescue him by repeating the manoeuvre\\nthey had practised to save the missionary, and he would soon be with\\nhis friends again; but nothing was seen, not a sound was heard. The case\\nseemed desperate.\\n\\nAbout half-past two o\\'clock, the Victoria hove in sight of Tangalia, a\\nvillage situated on the eastern shore of Lake Tchad, where it marks the\\nextreme point attained by Denham at the period of his exploration.\\n\\nThe doctor became uneasy at this persistent setting of the wind in that\\ndirection, for he felt that he was being thrown back to the eastward,\\ntoward the centre of Africa, and the interminable deserts of that\\nregion.\\n\\n\"We must absolutely come to a halt,\" said he, \"and even alight. For\\nJoe\\'s sake, particularly, we ought to go back to the lake; but, to begin\\nwith, let us endeavor to find an opposite current.\"\\n\\nDuring more than an hour he searched at different altitudes: the balloon\\nalways came back toward the mainland. But at length, at the height of a\\nthousand feet, a very violent breeze swept to the northwestward.\\n\\nIt was out of the question that Joe should have been detained on one of\\nthe islands of the lake; for, in such case he would certainly have found\\nmeans to make his presence there known. Perhaps he had been dragged to\\nthe mainland. The doctor was reasoning thus to himself, when he again\\ncame in sight of the northern shore of Lake Tchad.\\n\\nAs for supposing that Joe had been drowned, that was not to be believed\\nfor a moment. One horrible thought glanced across the minds of both\\nKennedy and the doctor: caymans swarm in these waters! But neither one\\nnor the other had the courage to distinctly communicate this impression.\\nHowever, it came up to them so forcibly at last that the doctor said,\\nwithout further preface:\\n\\n\"Crocodiles are found only on the shores of the islands or of the lake,\\nand Joe will have skill enough to avoid them. Besides, they are not very\\ndangerous; and the Africans bathe with impunity, and quite fearless of\\ntheir attacks.\"\\n\\nKennedy made no reply. He preferred keeping quiet to discussing this\\nterrible possibility.\\n\\nThe doctor made out the town of Lari about five o\\'clock in the evening.\\nThe inhabitants were at work gathering in their cotton-crop in front\\nof their huts, constructed of woven reeds, and standing in the midst\\nof clean and neatly-kept enclosures. This collection of about fifty\\nhabitations occupied a slight depression of the soil, in a valley\\nextending between two low mountains. The force of the wind carried the\\ndoctor farther onward than he wanted to go; but it changed a second\\ntime, and bore him back exactly to his starting-point, on the sort of\\nenclosed island where he had passed the preceding night. The anchor,\\ninstead of catching the branches of the tree, took hold in the masses\\nof reeds mixed with the thick mud of the marshes, which offered\\nconsiderable resistance.\\n\\nThe doctor had much difficulty in restraining the balloon; but at length\\nthe wind died away with the setting in of nightfall; and the two friends\\nkept watch together in an almost desperate state of mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH.\\n\\nThe Hurricane.--A Forced Departure.--Loss of an Anchor.--Melancholy\\nReflections.--The Resolution adopted.--The Sand-Storm.--The Buried\\nCaravan.--A Contrary yet Favorable Wind.--The Return southward.--Kennedy\\nat his Post.\\n\\nAt three o\\'clock in the morning the wind was raging. It beat down with\\nsuch violence that the Victoria could not stay near the ground without\\ndanger. It was thrown almost flat over upon its side, and the reeds\\nchafed the silk so roughly that it seemed as though they would tear it.\\n\\n\"We must be off, Dick,\" said the doctor; \"we cannot remain in this\\nsituation.\"\\n\\n\"But, doctor, what of Joe?\"\\n\\n\"I am not likely to abandon him. No, indeed! and should the hurricane\\ncarry me a thousand miles to the northward, I will return! But here we\\nare endangering the safety of all.\"\\n\\n\"Must we go without him?\" asked the Scot, with an accent of profound\\ngrief.\\n\\n\"And do you think, then,\" rejoined Ferguson, \"that my heart does not\\nbleed like your own? Am I not merely obeying an imperious necessity?\"\\n\\n\"I am entirely at your orders,\" replied the hunter; \"let us start!\"\\n\\nBut their departure was surrounded with unusual difficulty. The anchor,\\nwhich had caught very deeply, resisted all their efforts to disengage\\nit; while the balloon, drawing in the opposite direction, increased\\nits tension. Kennedy could not get it free. Besides, in his present\\nposition, the manoeuvre had become a very perilous one, for the Victoria\\nthreatened to break away before he should be able to get into the car\\nagain.\\n\\nThe doctor, unwilling to run such a risk, made his friend get into\\nhis place, and resigned himself to the alternative of cutting the\\nanchor-rope. The Victoria made one bound of three hundred feet into the\\nair, and took her route directly northward.\\n\\nFerguson had no other choice than to scud before the storm. He folded\\nhis arms, and soon became absorbed in his own melancholy reflections.\\n\\nAfter a few moments of profound silence, he turned to Kennedy, who sat\\nthere no less taciturn.\\n\\n\"We have, perhaps, been tempting Providence,\" said he; \"it does not\\nbelong to man to undertake such a journey!\"--and a sigh of grief escaped\\nhim as he spoke.\\n\\n\"It is but a few days,\" replied the sportsman, \"since we were\\ncongratulating ourselves upon having escaped so many dangers! All three\\nof us were shaking hands!\"\\n\\n\"Poor Joe! kindly and excellent disposition! brave and candid heart!\\nDazzled for a moment by his sudden discovery of wealth, he willingly\\nsacrificed his treasures! And now, he is far from us; and the wind is\\ncarrying us still farther away with resistless speed!\"\\n\\n\"Come, doctor, admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake\\ntribes, can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us,\\ndid;--like Denham, like Barth? Both of those men got back to their own\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! my dear Dick! Joe doesn\\'t know one word of the language; he is\\nalone, and without resources. The travellers of whom you speak did not\\nattempt to go forward without sending many presents in advance of them\\nto the chiefs, and surrounded by an escort armed and trained for\\nthese expeditions. Yet, they could not avoid sufferings of the worst\\ndescription! What, then, can you expect the fate of our companion to be?\\nIt is horrible to think of, and this is one of the worst calamities that\\nit has ever been my lot to endure!\"\\n\\n\"But, we\\'ll come back again, doctor!\"\\n\\n\"Come back, Dick? Yes, if we have to abandon the balloon! if we\\nshould be forced to return to Lake Tchad on foot, and put ourselves in\\ncommunication with the Sultan of Bornou! The Arabs cannot have retained\\na disagreeable remembrance of the first Europeans.\"\\n\\n\"I will follow you, doctor,\" replied the hunter, with emphasis. \"You\\nmay count upon me! We would rather give up the idea of prosecuting\\nthis journey than not return. Joe forgot himself for our sake; we will\\nsacrifice ourselves for his!\"\\n\\nThis resolve revived some hope in the hearts of these two men; they felt\\nstrong in the same inspiration. Ferguson forthwith set every thing at\\nwork to get into a contrary current, that might bring him back again\\nto Lake Tchad; but this was impracticable at that moment, and even to\\nalight was out of the question on ground completely bare of trees, and\\nwith such a hurricane blowing.\\n\\nThe Victoria thus passed over the country of the Tibbous, crossed the\\nBelad el Djerid, a desert of briers that forms the border of the Soudan,\\nand advanced into the desert of sand streaked with the long tracks\\nof the many caravans that pass and repass there. The last line of\\nvegetation was speedily lost in the dim southern horizon, not far from\\nthe principal oasis in this part of Africa, whose fifty wells are shaded\\nby magnificent trees; but it was impossible to stop. An Arab encampment,\\ntents of striped stuff, some camels, stretching out their viper-like\\nheads and necks along the sand, gave life to this solitude, but the\\nVictoria sped by like a shooting-star, and in this way traversed a\\ndistance of sixty miles in three hours, without Ferguson being able to\\ncheck or guide her course.\\n\\n\"We cannot halt, we cannot alight!\" said the doctor; \"not a tree, not an\\ninequality of the ground! Are we then to be driven clear across Sahara?\\nSurely, Heaven is indeed against us!\"\\n\\nHe was uttering these words with a sort of despairing rage, when\\nsuddenly he saw the desert sands rising aloft in the midst of a dense\\ncloud of dust, and go whirling through the air, impelled by opposing\\ncurrents.\\n\\nAmid this tornado, an entire caravan, disorganized, broken, and\\noverthrown, was disappearing beneath an avalanche of sand. The camels,\\nflung pell-mell together, were uttering dull and pitiful groans; cries\\nand howls of despair were heard issuing from that dusty and stifling\\ncloud, and, from time to time, a parti-colored garment cut the chaos\\nof the scene with its vivid hues, and the moaning and shrieking sounded\\nover all, a terrible accompaniment to this spectacle of destruction.\\n\\nEre long the sand had accumulated in compact masses; and there, where so\\nrecently stretched a level plain as far as the eye could see, rose now\\na ridgy line of hillocks, still moving from beneath--the vast tomb of an\\nentire caravan!\\n\\nThe doctor and Kennedy, pallid with emotion, sat transfixed by this\\nfearful spectacle. They could no longer manage their balloon, which went\\nwhirling round and round in contending currents, and refused to obey\\nthe different dilations of the gas. Caught in these eddies of the\\natmosphere, it spun about with a rapidity that made their heads reel,\\nwhile the car oscillated and swung to and fro violently at the same\\ntime. The instruments suspended under the awning clattered together as\\nthough they would be dashed to pieces; the pipes of the spiral bent\\nto and fro, threatening to break at every instant; and the water-tanks\\njostled and jarred with tremendous din. Although but two feet apart,\\nour aeronauts could not hear each other speak, but with firmly-clinched\\nhands they clung convulsively to the cordage, and endeavored to steady\\nthemselves against the fury of the tempest.\\n\\nKennedy, with his hair blown wildly about his face, looked on without\\nspeaking; but the doctor had regained all his daring in the midst of\\nthis deadly peril, and not a sign of his emotion was betrayed in his\\ncountenance, even when, after a last violent twirl, the Victoria stopped\\nsuddenly in the midst of a most unlooked-for calm; the north wind had\\nabruptly got the upper hand, and now drove her back with equal rapidity\\nover the route she had traversed in the morning.\\n\\n\"Whither are we going now?\" cried Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Let us leave that to Providence, my dear Dick; I was wrong in doubting\\nit. It knows better than we, and here we are, returning to places that\\nwe had expected never to see again!\"\\n\\nThe surface of the country, which had looked so flat and level when they\\nwere coming, now seemed tossed and uneven, like the ocean-billows after\\na storm; a long succession of hillocks, that had scarcely settled to\\ntheir places yet, indented the desert; the wind blew furiously, and the\\nballoon fairly flew through the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe direction taken by our aeronauts differed somewhat from that of\\nthe morning, and thus about nine o\\'clock, instead of finding themselves\\nagain near the borders of Lake Tchad, they saw the desert still\\nstretching away before them.\\n\\nKennedy remarked the circumstance.\\n\\n\"It matters little,\" replied the doctor, \"the important point is to\\nreturn southward; we shall come across the towns of Bornou, Wouddie, or\\nKouka, and I should not hesitate to halt there.\"\\n\\n\"If you are satisfied, I am content,\" replied the Scot, \"but Heaven\\ngrant that we may not be reduced to cross the desert, as those\\nunfortunate Arabs had to do! What we saw was frightful!\"\\n\\n\"It often happens, Dick; these trips across the desert are far more\\nperilous than those across the ocean. The desert has all the dangers of\\nthe sea, including the risk of being swallowed up, and added thereto are\\nunendurable fatigues and privations.\"\\n\\n\"I think the wind shows some symptoms of moderating; the sand-dust is\\nless dense; the undulations of the surface are diminishing, and the sky\\nis growing clearer.\"\\n\\n\"So much the better! We must now reconnoitre attentively with our\\nglasses, and take care not to omit a single point.\"\\n\\n\"I will look out for that, doctor, and not a tree shall be seen without\\nmy informing you of it.\"\\n\\nAnd, suiting the action to the word, Kennedy took his station, spy-glass\\nin hand, at the forward part of the car.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-FIFTH.\\n\\nWhat happened to Joe.--The Island of the Biddiomahs.--The Adoration\\nshown him.--The Island that sank.--The Shores of the Lake.--The Tree\\nof the Serpents.--The Foot-Tramp.--Terrible Suffering.--Mosquitoes and\\nAnts.--Hunger.--The Victoria seen.--She disappears.--The Swamp.--One\\nLast Despairing Cry.\\n\\nWhat had become of Joe, while his master was thus vainly seeking for\\nhim?\\n\\nWhen he had dashed headlong into the lake, his first movement on\\ncoming to the surface was to raise his eyes and look upward. He saw the\\nVictoria already risen far above the water, still rapidly ascending and\\ngrowing smaller and smaller. It was soon caught in a rapid current and\\ndisappeared to the northward. His master--both his friends were saved!\\n\\n\"How lucky it was,\" thought he, \"that I had that idea to throw myself\\nout into the lake! Mr. Kennedy would soon have jumped at it, and he\\nwould not have hesitated to do as I did, for nothing\\'s more natural than\\nfor one man to give himself up to save two others. That\\'s mathematics!\"\\n\\nSatisfied on this point, Joe began to think of himself. He was in the\\nmiddle of a vast lake, surrounded by tribes unknown to him, and probably\\nferocious. All the greater reason why he should get out of the scrape\\nby depending only on himself. And so he gave himself no farther concern\\nabout it.\\n\\nBefore the attack by the birds of prey, which, according to him, had\\nbehaved like real condors, he had noticed an island on the horizon, and\\ndetermining to reach it, if possible, he put forth all his knowledge and\\nskill in the art of swimming, after having relieved himself of the most\\ntroublesome part of his clothing. The idea of a stretch of five or six\\nmiles by no means disconcerted him; and therefore, so long as he was\\nin the open lake, he thought only of striking out straight ahead and\\nmanfully.\\n\\nIn about an hour and a half the distance between him and the island had\\ngreatly diminished.\\n\\nBut as he approached the land, a thought, at first fleeting and then\\ntenacious, arose in his mind. He knew that the shores of the lake were\\nfrequented by huge alligators, and was well aware of the voracity of\\nthose monsters.\\n\\nNow, no matter how much he was inclined to find every thing in this\\nworld quite natural, the worthy fellow was no little disturbed by\\nthis reflection. He feared greatly lest white flesh like his might be\\nparticularly acceptable to the dreaded brutes, and advanced only with\\nextreme precaution, his eyes on the alert on both sides and all around\\nhim. At length, he was not more than one hundred yards from a bank,\\ncovered with green trees, when a puff of air strongly impregnated with a\\nmusky odor reached him.\\n\\n\"There!\" said he to himself, \"just what I expected. The crocodile isn\\'t\\nfar off!\"\\n\\nWith this he dived swiftly, but not sufficiently so to avoid coming into\\ncontact with an enormous body, the scaly surface of which scratched him\\nas he passed. He thought himself lost and swam with desperate energy.\\nThen he rose again to the top of the water, took breath and dived once\\nmore. Thus passed a few minutes of unspeakable anguish, which all his\\nphilosophy could not overcome, for he thought, all the while, that\\nhe heard behind him the sound of those huge jaws ready to snap him up\\nforever. In this state of mind he was striking out under the water as\\nnoiselessly as possible when he felt himself seized by the arm and then\\nby the waist.\\n\\nPoor Joe! he gave one last thought to his master; and began to struggle\\nwith all the energy of despair, feeling himself the while drawn along,\\nbut not toward the bottom of the lake, as is the habit of the crocodile\\nwhen about to devour its prey, but toward the surface.\\n\\nSo soon as he could get breath and look around him, he saw that he was\\nbetween two natives as black as ebony, who held him, with a firm gripe,\\nand uttered strange cries.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said Joe, \"blacks instead of crocodiles! Well, I prefer it as it\\nis; but how in the mischief dare these fellows go in bathing in such\\nplaces?\"\\n\\nJoe was not aware that the inhabitants of the islands of Lake Tchad,\\nlike many other negro tribes, plunge with impunity into sheets of water\\ninfested with crocodiles and caymans, and without troubling their heads\\nabout them. The amphibious denizens of this lake enjoy the well-deserved\\nreputation of being quite inoffensive.\\n\\nBut had not Joe escaped one peril only to fall into another? That was\\na question which he left events to decide; and, since he could not\\ndo otherwise, he allowed himself to be conducted to the shore without\\nmanifesting any alarm.\\n\\n\"Evidently,\" thought he, \"these chaps saw the Victoria skimming the\\nwaters of the lake, like a monster of the air. They were the distant\\nwitnesses of my tumble, and they can\\'t fail to have some respect for a\\nman that fell from the sky! Let them have their own way, then.\"\\n\\nJoe was at this stage of his meditations, when he was landed amid a\\nyelling crowd of both sexes, and all ages and sizes, but not of all\\ncolors. In fine, he was surrounded by a tribe of Biddiomahs as black as\\njet. Nor had he to blush for the scantiness of his costume, for he saw\\nthat he was in \"undress\" in the highest style of that country.\\n\\nBut before he had time to form an exact idea of the situation, there was\\nno mistaking the agitation of which he instantly became the object, and\\nthis soon enabled him to pluck up courage, although the adventure of\\nKazah did come back rather vividly to his memory.\\n\\n\"I foresee that they are going to make a god of me again,\" thought he,\\n\"some son of the moon most likely. Well, one trade\\'s as good as another\\nwhen a man has no choice. The main thing is to gain time. Should the\\nVictoria pass this way again, I\\'ll take advantage of my new position\\nto treat my worshippers here to a miracle when I go sailing up into the\\nsky!\"\\n\\nWhile Joe\\'s thoughts were running thus, the throng pressed around him.\\nThey prostrated themselves before him; they howled; they felt him;\\nthey became even annoyingly familiar; but at the same time they had the\\nconsideration to offer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk\\nand rice pounded in honey. The worthy fellow, making the best of every\\nthing, took one of the heartiest luncheons he ever ate in his life, and\\ngave his new adorers an exalted idea of how the gods tuck away their\\nfood upon grand occasions.\\n\\nWhen evening came, the sorcerers of the island took him respectfully\\nby the hand, and conducted him to a sort of house surrounded with\\ntalismans; but, as he was entering it, Joe cast an uneasy look at the\\nheaps of human bones that lay scattered around this sanctuary. But he\\nhad still more time to think about them when he found himself at last\\nshut up in the cabin.\\n\\nDuring the evening and through a part of the night, he heard festive\\nchantings, the reverberations of a kind of drum, and a clatter of old\\niron, which were very sweet, no doubt, to African ears. Then there were\\nhowling choruses, accompanied by endless dances by gangs of natives who\\ncircled round and round the sacred hut with contortions and grimaces.\\n\\nJoe could catch the sound of this deafening orchestra, through the\\nmud and reeds of which his cabin was built; and perhaps under other\\ncircumstances he might have been amused by these strange ceremonies;\\nbut his mind was soon disturbed by quite different and less agreeable\\nreflections. Even looking at the bright side of things, he found it both\\nstupid and sad to be left alone in the midst of this savage country\\nand among these wild tribes. Few travellers who had penetrated to these\\nregions had ever again seen their native land. Moreover, could he trust\\nto the worship of which he saw himself the object? He had good reason to\\nbelieve in the vanity of human greatness; and he asked himself whether,\\nin this country, adoration did not sometimes go to the length of eating\\nthe object adored!\\n\\nBut, notwithstanding this rather perplexing prospect, after some hours\\nof meditation, fatigue got the better of his gloomy thoughts, and Joe\\nfell into a profound slumber, which would have lasted no doubt until\\nsunrise, had not a very unexpected sensation of dampness awakened the\\nsleeper. Ere long this dampness became water, and that water gained so\\nrapidly that it had soon mounted to Joe\\'s waist.\\n\\n\"What can this be?\" said he; \"a flood! a water-spout! or a new torture\\ninvented by these blacks? Faith, though, I\\'m not going to wait here till\\nit\\'s up to my neck!\"\\n\\nAnd, so saying, he burst through the frail wall with a jog of his\\npowerful shoulder, and found himself--where?--in the open lake! Island\\nthere was none. It had sunk during the night. In its place, the watery\\nimmensity of Lake Tchad!\\n\\n\"A poor country for the land-owners!\" said Joe, once more vigorously\\nresorting to his skill in the art of natation.\\n\\nOne of those phenomena, which are by no means unusual on Lake Tchad, had\\nliberated our brave Joe. More than one island, that previously seemed\\nto have the solidity of rock, has been submerged in this way; and the\\npeople living along the shores of the mainland have had to pick up the\\nunfortunate survivors of these terrible catastrophes.\\n\\nJoe knew nothing about this peculiarity of the region, but he was none\\nthe less ready to profit by it. He caught sight of a boat drifting\\nabout, without occupants, and was soon aboard of it. He found it to be\\nbut the trunk of a tree rudely hollowed out; but there were a couple of\\npaddles in it, and Joe, availing himself of a rapid current, allowed his\\ncraft to float along.\\n\\n\"But let us see where we are,\" he said. \"The polar-star there, that does\\nits work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to everybody\\nelse, will, most likely, do me that service.\"\\n\\nHe discovered, with satisfaction, that the current was taking him toward\\nthe northern shore of the lake, and he allowed himself to glide with\\nit. About two o\\'clock in the morning he disembarked upon a promontory\\ncovered with prickly reeds, that proved very provoking and inconvenient\\neven to a philosopher like him; but a tree grew there expressly to offer\\nhim a bed among its branches, and Joe climbed up into it for greater\\nsecurity, and there, without sleeping much, however, awaited the dawn of\\nday.\\n\\nWhen morning had come with that suddenness which is peculiar to the\\nequatorial regions, Joe cast a glance at the tree which had sheltered\\nhim during the last few hours, and beheld a sight that chilled the\\nmarrow in his bones. The branches of the tree were literally covered\\nwith snakes and chameleons! The foliage actually was hidden beneath\\ntheir coils, so that the beholder might have fancied that he saw before\\nhim a new kind of tree that bore reptiles for its leaves and fruit. And\\nall this horrible living mass writhed and twisted in the first rays of\\nthe morning sun! Joe experienced a keen sensation or terror mingled with\\ndisgust, as he looked at it, and he leaped precipitately from the tree\\namid the hissings of these new and unwelcome bedfellows.\\n\\n\"Now, there\\'s something that I would never have believed!\" said he.\\n\\nHe was not aware that Dr. Vogel\\'s last letters had made known this\\nsingular feature of the shores of Lake Tchad, where reptiles are more\\nnumerous than in any other part of the world. But after what he had just\\nseen, Joe determined to be more circumspect for the future; and, taking\\nhis bearings by the sun, he set off afoot toward the northeast,\\navoiding with the utmost care cabins, huts, hovels, and dens of every\\ndescription, that might serve in any manner as a shelter for human\\nbeings.\\n\\nHow often his gaze was turned upward to the sky! He hoped to catch a\\nglimpse, each time, of the Victoria; and, although he looked vainly\\nduring all that long, fatiguing day of sore foot-travel, his confident\\nreliance on his master remained undiminished. Great energy of character\\nwas needed to enable him thus to sustain the situation with philosophy.\\nHunger conspired with fatigue to crush him, for a man\\'s system is not\\ngreatly restored and fortified by a diet of roots, the pith of plants,\\nsuch as the Mele, or the fruit of the doum palm-tree; and yet, according\\nto his own calculations, Joe was enabled to push on about twenty miles\\nto the westward.\\n\\nHis body bore in scores of places the marks of the thorns with which the\\nlake-reeds, the acacias, the mimosas, and other wild shrubbery through\\nwhich he had to force his way, are thickly studded; and his torn and\\nbleeding feet rendered walking both painful and difficult. But at length\\nhe managed to react against all these sufferings; and when evening came\\nagain, he resolved to pass the night on the shores of Lake Tchad.\\n\\nThere he had to endure the bites of myriads of insects--gnats,\\nmosquitoes, ants half an inch long, literally covered the ground; and,\\nin less than two hours, Joe had not a rag remaining of the garments that\\nhad covered him, the insects having devoured them! It was a terrible\\nnight, that did not yield our exhausted traveller an hour of sleep.\\nDuring all this time the wild-boars and native buffaloes, reenforced\\nby the ajoub--a very dangerous species of lamantine--carried on their\\nferocious revels in the bushes and under the waters of the lake, filling\\nthe night with a hideous concert. Joe dared scarcely breathe. Even his\\ncourage and coolness had hard work to bear up against so terrible a\\nsituation.\\n\\nAt length, day came again, and Joe sprang to his feet precipitately; but\\njudge of the loathing he felt when he saw what species of creature\\nhad shared his couch--a toad!--but a toad five inches in length, a\\nmonstrous, repulsive specimen of vermin that sat there staring at him\\nwith huge round eyes. Joe felt his stomach revolt at the sight, and,\\nregaining a little strength from the intensity of his repugnance, he\\nrushed at the top of his speed and plunged into the lake. This sudden\\nbath somewhat allayed the pangs of the itching that tortured his whole\\nbody; and, chewing a few leaves, he set forth resolutely, again feeling\\nan obstinate resolution in the act, for which he could hardly account\\neven to his own mind. He no longer seemed to have entire control of his\\nown acts, and, nevertheless, he felt within him a strength superior to\\ndespair.\\n\\nHowever, he began now to suffer terribly from hunger. His stomach, less\\nresigned than he was, rebelled, and he was obliged to fasten a tendril\\nof wild-vine tightly about his waist. Fortunately, he could quench his\\nthirst at any moment, and, in recalling the sufferings he had undergone\\nin the desert, he experienced comparative relief in his exemption from\\nthat other distressing want.\\n\\n\"What can have become of the Victoria?\" he wondered. \"The wind blows\\nfrom the north, and she should be carried back by it toward the lake.\\nNo doubt the doctor has gone to work to right her balance, but yesterday\\nwould have given him time enough for that, so that may be to-day--but I\\nmust act just as if I was never to see him again. After all, if I only\\nget to one of the large towns on the lake, I\\'ll find myself no worse off\\nthan the travellers my master used to talk about. Why shouldn\\'t I work\\nmy way out of the scrape as well as they did? Some of them got back home\\nagain. Come, then! the deuce! Cheer up, my boy!\"\\n\\nThus talking to himself and walking on rapidly, Joe came right upon a\\nhorde of natives in the very depths of the forest, but he halted in time\\nand was not seen by them. The negroes were busy poisoning arrows with\\nthe juice of the euphorbium--a piece of work deemed a great affair among\\nthese savage tribes, and carried on with a sort of ceremonial solemnity.\\n\\nJoe, entirely motionless and even holding his breath, was keeping\\nhimself concealed in a thicket, when, happening to raise his eyes, he\\nsaw through an opening in the foliage the welcome apparition of the\\nballoon--the Victoria herself--moving toward the lake, at a height of\\nonly about one hundred feet above him. But he could not make himself\\nheard; he dared not, could not make his friends even see him!\\n\\nTears came to his eyes, not of grief but of thankfulness; his master was\\nthen seeking him; his master had not left him to perish! He would\\nhave to wait for the departure of the blacks; then he could quit his\\nhiding-place and run toward the borders of Lake Tchad!\\n\\nBut by this time the Victoria was disappearing in the distant sky.\\nJoe still determined to wait for her; she would come back again,\\nundoubtedly. She did, indeed, return, but farther to the eastward.\\nJoe ran, gesticulated, shouted--but all in vain! A strong breeze was\\nsweeping the balloon away with a speed that deprived him of all hope.\\n\\nFor the first time, energy and confidence abandoned the heart of the\\nunfortunate man. He saw that he was lost. He thought his master gone\\nbeyond all prospect of return. He dared no longer think; he would no\\nlonger reflect!\\n\\nLike a crazy man, his feet bleeding, his body cut and torn, he walked\\non during all that day and a part of the next night. He even dragged\\nhimself along, sometimes on his knees, sometimes with his hands. He saw\\nthe moment nigh when all his strength would fail, and nothing would be\\nleft to him but to sink upon the ground and die.\\n\\nThus working his way along, he at length found himself close to a marsh,\\nor what he knew would soon become a marsh, for night had set in some\\nhours before, and he fell by a sudden misstep into a thick, clinging\\nmire. In spite of all his efforts, in spite of his desperate struggles,\\nhe felt himself sinking gradually in the swampy ooze, and in a few\\nminutes he was buried to his waist.\\n\\n\"Here, then, at last, is death!\" he thought, in agony, \"and what a\\ndeath!\"\\n\\nHe now began to struggle again, like a madman; but his efforts only\\nserved to bury him deeper in the tomb that the poor doomed lad was\\nhollowing for himself; not a log of wood or a branch to buoy him up;\\nnot a reed to which he might cling! He felt that all was over! His eyes\\nconvulsively closed!\\n\\n\"Master! master!--Help!\" were his last words; but his voice, despairing,\\nunaided, half stifled already by the rising mire, died away feebly on\\nthe night.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SIXTH.\\n\\nA Throng of People on the Horizon.--A Troop of Arabs.--The Pursuit.--It\\nis He.--Fall from Horseback.--The Strangled Arab.--A Ball from\\nKennedy.--Adroit Manoeuvres.--Caught up flying.--Joe saved at last.\\n\\nFrom the moment when Kennedy resumed his post of observation in the\\nfront of the car, he had not ceased to watch the horizon with his utmost\\nattention.\\n\\nAfter the lapse of some time he turned toward the doctor and said:\\n\\n\"If I am not greatly mistaken I can see, off yonder in the distance, a\\nthrong of men or animals moving. It is impossible to make them out yet,\\nbut I observe that they are in violent motion, for they are raising a\\ngreat cloud of dust.\"\\n\\n\"May it not be another contrary breeze?\" said the doctor, \"another\\nwhirlwind coming to drive us back northward again?\" and while speaking\\nhe stood up to examine the horizon.\\n\\n\"I think not, Samuel; it is a troop of gazelles or of wild oxen.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps so, Dick; but yon throng is some nine or ten miles from us at\\nleast, and on my part, even with the glass, I can make nothing of it!\"\\n\\n\"At all events I shall not lose sight of it. There is something\\nremarkable about it that excites my curiosity. Sometimes it looks like\\na body of cavalry manoeuvring. Ah! I was not mistaken. It is, indeed, a\\nsquadron of horsemen. Look--look there!\"\\n\\nThe doctor eyed the group with great attention, and, after a moment\\'s\\npause, remarked:\\n\\n\"I believe that you are right. It is a detachment of Arabs or Tibbous,\\nand they are galloping in the same direction with us, as though in\\nflight, but we are going faster than they, and we are rapidly gaining on\\nthem. In half an hour we shall be near enough to see them and know what\\nthey are.\"\\n\\nKennedy had again lifted his glass and was attentively scrutinizing\\nthem. Meanwhile the crowd of horsemen was becoming more distinctly\\nvisible, and a few were seen to detach themselves from the main body.\\n\\n\"It is some hunting manoeuvre, evidently,\" said Kennedy. \"Those fellows\\nseem to be in pursuit of something. I would like to know what they are\\nabout.\"\\n\\n\"Patience, Dick! In a little while we shall overtake them, if they\\ncontinue on the same route. We are going at the rate of twenty miles per\\nhour, and no horse can keep up with that.\"\\n\\nKennedy again raised his glass, and a few minutes later he exclaimed:\\n\\n\"They are Arabs, galloping at the top of their speed; I can make\\nthem out distinctly. They are about fifty in number. I can see their\\nbournouses puffed out by the wind. It is some cavalry exercise that they\\nare going through. Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they\\nare rushing after him at headlong speed.\"\\n\\n\"Whoever they may be, Dick, they are not to be feared, and then, if\\nnecessary, we can go higher.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, doctor--wait a little!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s curious,\" said Kennedy again, after a brief pause, \"but there\\'s\\nsomething going on that I can\\'t exactly explain. By the efforts they\\nmake, and the irregularity of their line, I should fancy that those\\nArabs are pursuing some one, instead of following.\"\\n\\n\"Are you certain of that, Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! yes, it\\'s clear enough now. I am right! It is a pursuit--a\\nhunt--but a man-hunt! That is not their chief riding ahead of them, but\\na fugitive.\"\\n\\n\"A fugitive!\" exclaimed the doctor, growing more and more interested.\\n\\n\"Yes!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t lose sight of him, and let us wait!\"\\n\\nThree or four miles more were quickly gained upon these horsemen, who\\nnevertheless were dashing onward with incredible speed.\\n\\n\"Doctor! doctor!\" shouted Kennedy in an agitated voice.\\n\\n\"What is the matter, Dick?\"\\n\\n\"Is it an illusion? Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Wait!\" and so saying, the Scot wiped the sights of his spy-glass\\ncarefully, and looked through it again intently.\\n\\n\"Well?\" questioned the doctor.\\n\\n\"It is he, doctor!\"\\n\\n\"He!\" exclaimed Ferguson with emotion.\\n\\n\"It is he! no other!\" and it was needless to pronounce the name.\\n\\n\"Yes! it is he! on horseback, and only a hundred paces in advance of his\\nenemies! He is pursued!\"\\n\\n\"It is Joe--Joe himself!\" cried the doctor, turning pale.\\n\\n\"He cannot see us in his flight!\"\\n\\n\"He will see us, though!\" said the doctor, lowering the flame of his\\nblow-pipe.\\n\\n\"But how?\"\\n\\n\"In five minutes we shall be within fifty feet of the ground, and in\\nfifteen we shall be right over him!\"\\n\\n\"We must let him know it by firing a gun!\"\\n\\n\"No! he can\\'t turn back to come this way. He\\'s headed off!\"\\n\\n\"What shall we do, then?\"\\n\\n\"We must wait.\"\\n\\n\"Wait?--and these Arabs!\"\\n\\n\"We shall overtake them. We\\'ll pass them. We are not more than two miles\\nfrom them, and provided that Joe\\'s horse holds out!\"\\n\\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\"\\n\\nKennedy had uttered a cry of despair as he saw Joe fling himself to the\\nground. His horse, evidently exhausted, had just fallen headlong.\\n\\n\"He sees us!\" cried the doctor, \"and he motions to us, as he gets upon\\nhis feet!\"\\n\\n\"But the Arabs will overtake him! What is he waiting for? Ah! the brave\\nlad! Huzza!\" shouted the sportsman, who could no longer restrain his\\nfeelings.\\n\\nJoe, who had immediately sprung up after his fall, just as one of the\\nswiftest horsemen rushed upon him, bounded like a panther, avoided his\\nassailant by leaping to one side, jumped up behind him on the crupper,\\nseized the Arab by the throat, and, strangling him with his sinewy hands\\nand fingers of steel, flung him on the sand, and continued his headlong\\nflight.\\n\\nA tremendous howl was heard from the Arabs, but, completely engrossed by\\nthe pursuit, they had not taken notice of the balloon, which was now\\nbut five hundred paces behind them, and only about thirty feet from the\\nground. On their part, they were not twenty lengths of their horses from\\nthe fugitive.\\n\\nOne of them was very perceptibly gaining on Joe, and was about to\\npierce him with his lance, when Kennedy, with fixed eye and steady hand,\\nstopped him short with a ball, that hurled him to the earth.\\n\\nJoe did not even turn his head at the report. Some of the horsemen\\nreined in their barbs, and fell on their faces in the dust as they\\ncaught sight of the Victoria; the rest continued their pursuit.\\n\\n\"But what is Joe about?\" said Kennedy; \"he don\\'t stop!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s doing better than that, Dick! I understand him! He\\'s keeping on in\\nthe same direction as the balloon. He relies upon our intelligence. Ah!\\nthe noble fellow! We\\'ll carry him off in the very teeth of those Arab\\nrascals! We are not more than two hundred paces from him!\"\\n\\n\"What are we to do?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Lay aside your rifle, Dick.\"\\n\\nAnd the Scot obeyed the request at once.\\n\\n\"Do you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast\\nin your arms?\"\\n\\n\"Ay, more than that!\"\\n\\n\"No! That will be enough!\"\\n\\nAnd the doctor proceeded to pile up bags of sand in Kennedy\\'s arms.\\n\\n\"Hold yourself in readiness in the back part of the car, and be prepared\\nto throw out that ballast at a single effort. But, for your life, don\\'t\\ndo so until I give the word!\"\\n\\n\"Be easy on that point.\"\\n\\n\"Otherwise, we should miss Joe, and he would be lost.\"\\n\\n\"Count upon me!\"\\n\\nThe Victoria at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who\\nwere still desperately urging their steeds at Joe\\'s heels. The doctor,\\nstanding in the front of the car, held the ladder clear, ready to throw\\nit at any moment. Meanwhile, Joe had still maintained the distance\\nbetween himself and his pursuers--say about fifty feet. The Victoria was\\nnow ahead of the party.\\n\\n\"Attention!\" exclaimed the doctor to Kennedy.\\n\\n\"I\\'m ready!\"\\n\\n\"Joe, look out for yourself!\" shouted the doctor in his sonorous,\\nringing voice, as he flung out the ladder, the lowest ratlines of which\\ntossed up the dust of the road.\\n\\nAs the doctor shouted, Joe had turned his head, but without checking his\\nhorse. The ladder dropped close to him, and at the instant he grasped it\\nthe doctor again shouted to Kennedy:\\n\\n\"Throw ballast!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s done!\"\\n\\nAnd the Victoria, lightened by a weight greater than Joe\\'s, shot up one\\nhundred and fifty feet into the air.\\n\\nJoe clung with all his strength to the ladder during the wide\\noscillations that it had to describe, and then making an indescribable\\ngesture to the Arabs, and climbing with the agility of a monkey, he\\nsprang up to his companions, who received him with open arms.\\n\\nThe Arabs uttered a scream of astonishment and rage. The fugitive\\nhad been snatched from them on the wing, and the Victoria was rapidly\\nspeeding far beyond their reach.\\n\\n\"Master! Kennedy!\" ejaculated Joe, and overwhelmed, at last, with\\nfatigue and emotion, the poor fellow fainted away, while Kennedy, almost\\nbeside himself, kept exclaiming:\\n\\n\"Saved--saved!\"\\n\\n\"Saved indeed!\" murmured the doctor, who had recovered all his\\nphlegmatic coolness.\\n\\nJoe was almost naked. His bleeding arms, his body covered with cuts and\\nbruises, told what his sufferings had been. The doctor quietly dressed\\nhis wounds, and laid him comfortably under the awning.\\n\\nJoe soon returned to consciousness, and asked for a glass of brandy,\\nwhich the doctor did not see fit to refuse, as the faithful fellow had\\nto be indulged.\\n\\nAfter he had swallowed the stimulant, Joe grasped the hands of his two\\nfriends and announced that he was ready to relate what had happened to\\nhim.\\n\\nBut they would not allow him to talk at that time, and he sank back into\\na profound sleep, of which he seemed to have the greatest possible need.\\n\\nThe Victoria was then taking an oblique line to the westward. Driven\\nby a tempestuous wind, it again approached the borders of the thorny\\ndesert, which the travellers descried over the tops of palm-trees, bent\\nand broken by the storm; and, after having made a run of two hundred\\nmiles since rescuing Joe, it passed the tenth degree of east longitude\\nabout nightfall.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENTH.\\n\\nThe Western Route.--Joe wakes up.--His Obstinacy.--End of Joe\\'s\\nNarrative.--Tagelei.--Kennedy\\'s Anxieties.--The Route to the North.--A\\nNight near Aghades.\\n\\nDuring the night the wind lulled as though reposing after the\\nboisterousness of the day, and the Victoria remained quietly at the top\\nof the tall sycamore. The doctor and Kennedy kept watch by turns, and\\nJoe availed himself of the chance to sleep most sturdily for twenty-four\\nhours at a stretch.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the remedy he needs,\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"Nature will take\\ncharge of his care.\"\\n\\nWith the dawn the wind sprang up again in quite strong, and moreover\\ncapricious gusts. It shifted abruptly from south to north, but finally\\nthe Victoria was carried away by it toward the west.\\n\\nThe doctor, map in hand, recognized the kingdom of Damerghou, an\\nundulating region of great fertility, in which the huts that compose the\\nvillages are constructed of long reeds interwoven with branches of the\\nasclepia. The grain-mills were seen raised in the cultivated fields,\\nupon small scaffoldings or platforms, to keep them out of the reach of\\nthe mice and the huge ants of that country.\\n\\nThey soon passed the town of Zinder, recognized by its spacious place\\nof execution, in the centre of which stands the \"tree of death.\" At\\nits foot the executioner stands waiting, and whoever passes beneath its\\nshadow is immediately hung!\\n\\nUpon consulting his compass, Kennedy could not refrain from saying:\\n\\n\"Look! we are again moving northward.\"\\n\\n\"No matter; if it only takes us to Timbuctoo, we shall not complain.\\nNever was a finer voyage accomplished under better circumstances!\"\\n\\n\"Nor in better health,\" said Joe, at that instant thrusting his jolly\\ncountenance from between the curtains of the awning.\\n\\n\"There he is! there\\'s our gallant friend--our preserver!\" exclaimed\\nKennedy, cordially.--\"How goes it, Joe?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! why, naturally enough, Mr. Kennedy, very naturally! I never felt\\nbetter in my life! Nothing sets a man up like a little pleasure-trip\\nwith a bath in Lake Tchad to start on--eh, doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Brave fellow!\" said Ferguson, pressing Joe\\'s hand, \"what terrible\\nanxiety you caused us!\"\\n\\n\"Humph! and you, sir? Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about\\nyou, gentlemen? You gave me a fine fright, let me tell you!\"\\n\\n\"We shall never agree in the world, Joe, if you take things in that\\nstyle.\"\\n\\n\"I see that his tumble hasn\\'t changed him a bit,\" added Kennedy.\\n\\n\"Your devotion and self-forgetfulness were sublime, my brave lad, and\\nthey saved us, for the Victoria was falling into the lake, and, once\\nthere, nobody could have extricated her.\"\\n\\n\"But, if my devotion, as you are pleased to call my summerset, saved\\nyou, did it not save me too, for here we are, all three of us, in\\nfirst-rate health? Consequently we have nothing to squabble about in the\\nwhole affair.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! we can never come to a settlement with that youth,\" said the\\nsportsman.\\n\\n\"The best way to settle it,\" replied Joe, \"is to say nothing more about\\nthe matter. What\\'s done is done. Good or bad, we can\\'t take it back.\"\\n\\n\"You obstinate fellow!\" said the doctor, laughing; \"you can\\'t refuse,\\nthough, to tell us your adventures, at all events.\"\\n\\n\"Not if you think it worth while. But, in the first place, I\\'m going to\\ncook this fat goose to a turn, for I see that Mr. Kennedy has not wasted\\nhis time.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Joe!\"\\n\\n\"Well, let us see then how this African game will sit on a European\\nstomach!\"\\n\\nThe goose was soon roasted by the flame of the blow-pipe, and not long\\nafterward was comfortably stowed away. Joe took his own good share,\\nlike a man who had eaten nothing for several days. After the tea and the\\npunch, he acquainted his friends with his recent adventures. He\\nspoke with some emotion, even while looking at things with his usual\\nphilosophy. The doctor could not refrain from frequently pressing his\\nhand when he saw his worthy servant more considerate of his master\\'s\\nsafety than of his own, and, in relation to the sinking of the island\\nof the Biddiomahs, he explained to him the frequency of this phenomenon\\nupon Lake Tchad.\\n\\nAt length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where,\\nsinking in the swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.\\n\\n\"I thought I was gone,\" said he, \"and as you came right into my mind, I\\nmade a hard fight for it. How, I couldn\\'t tell you--but I\\'d made up my\\nmind that I wouldn\\'t go under without knowing why. Just then, I saw--two\\nor three feet from me--what do you think? the end of a rope that had\\nbeen fresh cut; so I took leave to make another jerk, and, by hook or\\nby crook, I got to the rope. When I pulled, it didn\\'t give; so I pulled\\nagain and hauled away and there I was on dry ground! At the end of\\nthe rope, I found an anchor! Ah, master, I\\'ve a right to call that the\\nanchor of safety, anyhow, if you have no objection. I knew it again! It\\nwas the anchor of the Victoria! You had grounded there! So I followed\\nthe direction of the rope and that gave me your direction, and, after\\ntrying hard a few times more, I got out of the swamp. I had got my\\nstrength back with my spunk, and I walked on part of the night away\\nfrom the lake, until I got to the edge of a very big wood. There I saw a\\nfenced-in place, where some horses were grazing, without thinking of any\\nharm. Now, there are times when everybody knows how to ride a horse, are\\nthere not, doctor? So I didn\\'t spend much time thinking about it, but\\njumped right on the back of one of those innocent animals and away we\\nwent galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us. I needn\\'t tell\\nyou about the towns that I didn\\'t see nor the villages that I took\\ngood care to go around. No! I crossed the ploughed fields; I leaped\\nthe hedges; I scrambled over the fences; I dug my heels into my nag; I\\nthrashed him; I fairly lifted the poor fellow off his feet! At last I\\ngot to the end of the tilled land. Good! There was the desert. \\'That\\nsuits me!\\' said I, \\'for I can see better ahead of me and farther too.\\' I\\nwas hoping all the time to see the balloon tacking about and waiting for\\nme. But not a bit of it; and so, in about three hours, I go plump, like\\na fool, into a camp of Arabs! Whew! what a hunt that was! You see, Mr.\\nKennedy, a hunter don\\'t know what a real hunt is until he\\'s been hunted\\nhimself! Still I advise him not to try it if he can keep out of it! My\\nhorse was so tired, he was ready to drop off his legs; they were close\\non me; I threw myself to the ground; then I jumped up again behind an\\nArab! I didn\\'t mean the fellow any harm, and I hope he has no grudge\\nagainst me for choking him, but I saw you--and you know the rest.\\nThe Victoria came on at my heels, and you caught me up flying, as\\na circus-rider does a ring. Wasn\\'t I right in counting on you? Now,\\ndoctor, you see how simple all that was! Nothing more natural in the\\nworld! I\\'m ready to begin over again, if it would be of any service\\nto you. And besides, master, as I said a while ago, it\\'s not worth\\nmentioning.\"\\n\\n\"My noble, gallant Joe!\" said the doctor, with great feeling. \"Heart of\\ngold! we were not astray in trusting to your intelligence and skill.\"\\n\\n\"Poh! doctor, one has only just to follow things along as they happen,\\nand he can always work his way out of a scrape! The safest plan, you\\nsee, is to take matters as they come.\"\\n\\nWhile Joe was telling his experience, the balloon had rapidly passed\\nover a long reach of country, and Kennedy soon pointed out on the\\nhorizon a collection of structures that looked like a town. The doctor\\nglanced at his map and recognized the place as the large village of\\nTagelei, in the Damerghou country.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said he, \"we come upon Dr. Barth\\'s route. It was at this place\\nthat he parted from his companions, Richardson and Overweg; the first\\nwas to follow the Zinder route, and the second that of Maradi; and you\\nmay remember that, of these three travellers, Barth was the only one who\\never returned to Europe.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said Kennedy, following out on the map the direction of the\\nVictoria, \"we are going due north.\"\\n\\n\"Due north, Dick.\"\\n\\n\"And don\\'t that give you a little uneasiness?\"\\n\\n\"Why should it?\"\\n\\n\"Because that line leads to Tripoli, and over the Great Desert.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we shall not go so far as that, my friend--at least, I hope not.\"\\n\\n\"But where do you expect to halt?\"\\n\\n\"Come, Dick, don\\'t you feel some curiosity to see Timbuctoo?\"\\n\\n\"Timbuctoo?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Joe; \"nobody nowadays can think of making the trip to\\nAfrica without going to see Timbuctoo.\"\\n\\n\"You will be only the fifth or sixth European who has ever set eyes on\\nthat mysterious city.\"\\n\\n\"Ho, then, for Timbuctoo!\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, let us try to get as far as between the seventeenth and\\neighteenth degrees of north latitude, and there we will seek a favorable\\nwind to carry us westward.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" said the hunter. \"But have we still far to go to the northward?\"\\n\\n\"One hundred and fifty miles at least.\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" said Kennedy, \"I\\'ll turn in and sleep a bit.\"\\n\\n\"Sleep, sir; sleep!\" urged Joe. \"And you, doctor, do the same yourself:\\nyou must have need of rest, for I made you keep watch a little out of\\ntime.\"\\n\\nThe sportsman stretched himself under the awning; but Ferguson, who was\\nnot easily conquered by fatigue, remained at his post.\\n\\nIn about three hours the Victoria was crossing with extreme rapidity\\nan expanse of stony country, with ranges of lofty, naked mountains of\\ngranitic formation at the base. A few isolated peaks attained the height\\nof even four thousand feet. Giraffes, antelopes, and ostriches were seen\\nrunning and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of\\nacacias, mimosas, souahs, and date-trees. After the barrenness of the\\ndesert, vegetation was now resuming its empire. This was the country of\\nthe Kailouas, who veil their faces with a bandage of cotton, like their\\ndangerous neighbors, the Touaregs.\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock in the evening, after a splendid trip of two hundred and\\nfifty miles, the Victoria halted over an important town. The moonlight\\nrevealed glimpses of one district half in ruins; and some pinnacles of\\nmosques and minarets shot up here and there, glistening in the silvery\\nrays. The doctor took a stellar observation, and discovered that he was\\nin the latitude of Aghades.\\n\\nThis city, once the seat of an immense trade, was already falling into\\nruin when Dr. Barth visited it.\\n\\nThe Victoria, not being seen in the obscurity of night, descended about\\ntwo miles above Aghades, in a field of millet. The night was calm, and\\nbegan to break into dawn about three o\\'clock A.M.; while a light wind\\ncoaxed the balloon westward, and even a little toward the south.\\n\\nDr. Ferguson hastened to avail himself of such good fortune, and rapidly\\nascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning\\nsunshine.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH.\\n\\nA Rapid Passage.--Prudent Resolves.--Caravans in Sight.--Incessant\\nRains.--Goa.--The Niger.--Golberry, Geoffroy, and Gray.--Mungo\\nPark.--Laing.--Rene Caillie.--Clapperton.--John and Richard Lander.\\n\\nThe 17th of May passed tranquilly, without any remarkable incident; the\\ndesert gained upon them once more; a moderate wind bore the Victoria\\ntoward the southwest, and she never swerved to the right or to the left,\\nbut her shadow traced a perfectly straight line on the sand.\\n\\nBefore starting, the doctor had prudently renewed his stock of water,\\nhaving feared that he should not be able to touch ground in these\\nregions, infested as they are by the Aouelim-Minian Touaregs. The\\nplateau, at an elevation of eighteen hundred feet above the level of the\\nsea, sloped down toward the south. Our travellers, having crossed\\nthe Aghades route at Murzouk--a route often pressed by the feet of\\ncamels--arrived that evening, in the sixteenth degree of north latitude,\\nand four degrees fifty-five minutes east longitude, after having\\npassed over one hundred and eighty miles of a long and monotonous day\\'s\\njourney.\\n\\nDuring the day Joe dressed the last pieces of game, which had been only\\nhastily prepared, and he served up for supper a mess of snipe, that were\\ngreatly relished. The wind continuing good, the doctor resolved to keep\\non during the night, the moon, still nearly at the full, illumining it\\nwith her radiance. The Victoria ascended to a height of five hundred\\nfeet, and, during her nocturnal trip of about sixty miles, the gentle\\nslumbers of an infant would not have been disturbed by her motion.\\n\\nOn Sunday morning, the direction of the wind again changed, and it bore\\nto the northwestward. A few crows were seen sweeping through the\\nair, and, off on the horizon, a flock of vultures which, fortunately,\\nhowever, kept at a distance.\\n\\nThe sight of these birds led Joe to compliment his master on the idea of\\nhaving two balloons.\\n\\n\"Where would we be,\" said he, \"with only one balloon? The second balloon\\nis like the life-boat to a ship; in case of wreck we could always take\\nto it and escape.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, friend Joe,\" said the doctor, \"only that my life-boat\\ngives me some uneasiness. It is not so good as the main craft.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by that, doctor?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n\"I mean to say that the new Victoria is not so good as the old one.\\nWhether it be that the stuff it is made of is too much worn, or that the\\nheat of the spiral has melted the gutta-percha, I can observe a\\ncertain loss of gas. It don\\'t amount to much thus far, but still it\\nis noticeable. We have a tendency to sink, and, in order to keep our\\nelevation, I am compelled to give greater dilation to the hydrogen.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce!\" exclaimed Kennedy with concern; \"I see no remedy for that.\"\\n\\n\"There is none, Dick, and that is why we must hasten our progress, and\\neven avoid night halts.\"\\n\\n\"Are we still far from the coast?\" asked Joe.\\n\\n\"Which coast, my boy? How are we to know whither chance will carry us?\\nAll that I can say is, that Timbuctoo is still about four hundred miles\\nto the westward.\\n\\n\"And how long will it take us to get there?\"\\n\\n\"Should the wind not carry us too far out of the way, I hope to reach\\n\\n[end of the book]\\n\\nNow you have read it. Please summarize it for me. First, tell me the title and the author, and then tell the story in 500 words.\\n ASSISTANT:'"

Therefore I have been encouraged to write a new \"TWINKLE\\nBOOK,\" hoping with all my heart that my little friends will find it\\nworthy to occupy a place beside the others on their pet bookshelves.\\nAnd because the children seem to especially love the story of \"Bandit\\nJim Crow,\" and bird-life is sure to appeal alike to their hearts and\\ntheir imaginations, I have again written about birds.\\n\\nThe tale is fantastical, and intended to amuse rather than instruct;\\nyet many of the traits of the feathered folk, herein described, are in\\nstrict accordance with natural history teachings and will serve to\\nacquaint my readers with the habits of birds in their wildwood homes.\\nAt the same time my birds do unexpected things, because I have written\\na fairy tale and not a natural history.\\n\\nThe question is often asked me whether Twinkle and Chubbins were asleep\\nor awake when they encountered these wonderful adventures; and it\\ngrieves me to reflect that the modern child has been deprived of fairy\\ntales to such an extent that it does not know--as I did when a girl--\\nthat in a fairy story it does not matter whether one is awake or not.\\nYou must accept it as you would a fragrant breeze that cools your brow,\\na draught of sweet water, or the delicious flavor of a strawberry, and\\nbe grateful for the pleasure it brings you, without stopping to\\nquestion too closely its source.\\n\\nFor my part I am glad if my stories serve to while away a pleasant hour\\nbefore bedtime or keep one contented on a rainy day. In this way they\\nare sure to be useful, and if a little tenderness for the helpless\\nanimals and birds is acquired with the amusement, the value of the\\ntales will be doubled.\\n\\nLAURA BANCROFT.\\n\\n\\nLIST OF CHAPTERS\\n\\nI     LITTLE ONES IN TROUBLE\\nII    POLICEMAN BLUEJAY\\nIII   THE CHILD-LARKS\\nIV    AN AFTERNOON RECEPTION\\nV     THE ORIOLE\\'S STORY\\nVI    A MERRY ADVENTURE\\nVII   THE BLUEJAY\\'S STORY\\nVIII  MRS.

They had followed the straight path into the\\ngreat forest, and had only stopped for a moment to sit down and rest,\\nwith the basket between them and their backs to a big tree. Twinkle\\nwinked just twice, because she usually took a nap in the afternoon, and\\nChubbins merely closed his eyes a second to find out if he could see\\nthat long streak of sunshine through his pink eyelids. Yet during this\\nsecond, which happened while Twinkle was winking, the path had run away\\nand left them without any guide or any notion which way they ought to\\ngo.\\n\\nAnother strange thing was that when they jumped up to look around them\\nthe nearest trees began sliding away, in a circle, leaving the little\\ngirl and boy in a clear space. And the trees continued moving back and\\nback, farther and farther, until all their trunks were jammed tight\\ntogether, and not even a mouse could have crept between them. They made\\na solid ring around Twinkle and Chubbins, who stood looking at this\\ntransformation with wondering eyes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a trap,\" said Chubbins; \"and we\\'re in it.\"\\n\\n\"It looks that way,\" replied Twinkle, thoughtfully. \"Isn\\'t it lucky,\\nChub, we have the basket with us? If it wasn\\'t for that, we might\\nstarve to death in our prison.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well,\" replied the little fellow, \"the basket won\\'t last long.\\nThere\\'s plenty of starve in the bottom of it, Twinkle, any way you can\\nfix it.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so; unless we can get out. Whatever do you suppose made the\\ntrees behave that way, Chubbins?\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said the boy.\\n\\nJust then a queer creature dropped from a tree into the ring and began\\nmoving slowly toward them. It was flat in shape, like a big turtle;\\nonly it hadn\\'t a turtle\\'s hard shell. Instead, its body was covered\\nwith sharp prickers, like rose thorns, and it had two small red eyes\\nthat looked cruel and wicked. The children could not see how many legs\\nit had, but they must have been very short, because the creature moved\\nso slowly over the ground.\\n\\nWhen it had drawn near to them it said, in a pleading tone that sounded\\nsoft and rather musical:\\n\\n\"Little girl, pick me up in your arms, and pet me!\"\\n\\nTwinkle shrank back.\\n\\n\"My! I couldn\\'t _think_ of doing such a thing,\" she answered.\\n\\nThen the creature said:\\n\\n\"Little boy, please pick me up in your arms, and pet me!\"\\n\\n\"Go \\'way!\" shouted Chubbins. \"I wouldn\\'t touch you for anything.\"\\n\\nThe creature turned its red eyes first upon one and then upon the\\nother.\\n\\n\"Listen, my dears,\" it continued; \"I was once a beautiful maiden, but a\\ncruel tuxix transformed me into this awful shape, and so must I remain\\nuntil some child willingly takes me in its arms and pets me. Then, and\\nnot till then, will I be restored to my proper form.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t believe it! Don\\'t believe it!\" cried a high, clear voice, and\\nboth the boy and the girl looked quickly around to see who had spoken.\\nBut no one besides themselves was in sight, and they only noticed a\\nthick branch of one of the trees slightly swaying its leaves.\\n\\n\"What is a tuxix?\" asked Twinkle, who was beginning to feel sorry for\\nthe poor creature.\\n\\n\"It is a magician, a sorcerer, a wizard, and a witch all rolled into\\none,\" was the answer; \"and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that\\nwould be.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful!\" cried the clear voice, again. \"It is the tuxix herself\\nwho is talking to you. Don\\'t believe a word you hear!\"\\n\\nAt this the red eyes of the creature flashed fire with anger, and it\\ntried to turn its clumsy body around to find the speaker. Twinkle and\\nChubbins looked too, but only heard a flutter and a mocking laugh\\ncoming from the trees.\\n\\n\"If I get my eye on that bird, it will never speak again,\" exclaimed\\nthe creature, in a voice of fury very different from the sweet tones it\\nhad at first used; and perhaps it was this fact that induced the\\nchildren to believe the warning was from a friend, and they would do\\nwell to heed it.\\n\\n\"Whether you are the tuxix or not,\" said Twinkle, \"I never will touch\\nyou. You may be sure of that.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I,\" declared Chubbins, stoutly, as he came closer to the girl and\\ngrasped her hand in his own.\\n\\nAt this the horrid thing bristled all its sharp prickers in anger, and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Then, if I cannot conquer you in one way, I will in another. Go, both\\nof you, and join the bird that warned you, and live in the air and the\\ntrees until you repent your stubbornness and promise to become my\\nslaves. The tuxix has spoken, and her magical powers are at work. Go!\"\\n\\nIn an instant Twinkle saw Chubbins shoot through the air and disappear\\namong the leaves of one of the tall trees. As he went he seemed to grow\\nvery small, and to change in shape.\\n\\n\"Wait!\" she cried. \"I\\'m coming, too!\"\\n\\nShe was afraid of losing Chubbins, so she flew after him, feeling\\nrather queer herself, and a moment after was safe in the tall tree,\\nclinging with her toes to a branch and looking in amazement at the boy\\nwho sat beside her.\\n\\nChubbins had been transformed into a pretty little bird--all, that is,\\nexcept his head, which was Chubbins\\' own head reduced in size to fit\\nthe bird body. It still had upon it the straw hat, which had also grown\\nsmall in size, and the sight that met Twinkle\\'s eyes was so funny that\\nshe laughed merrily, and her laugh was like the sweet warbling of a\\nskylark.\\n\\nChubbins looked at her and saw almost what she saw; for Twinkle was a\\nbird too, except for her head, with its checked sunbonnet, which had\\ngrown small enough to fit the pretty, glossy-feathered body of a lark.\\n\\nBoth of them had to cling fast to the branch with their toes, for their\\narms and hands were now wings. The toes were long and sharp pointed, so\\nthat they could be used in the place of fingers.\\n\\n\"My!\" exclaimed Twinkle; \"you\\'re a queer sight, Chubbins!\"\\n\\n\"So are you,\" answered the boy. \"That mean old thing must have \\'witched\\nus.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'re \\'chanted,\" said Twinkle. \"And now, what are we going to do\\nabout it? We can\\'t go home, for our folks would be scared nearly into\\nfits. And we don\\'t know the way home, either.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Chubbins, fluttering his little wings to keep from\\nfalling, for he had nearly lost his balance.\\n\\n\"What shall we do?\" she continued.\\n\\n\"Why, fly around and be gay and happy,\" said a clear and merry voice\\nbeside them. \"That\\'s what birds are expected to do!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER II] _The Forest Guardian_\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins twisted their heads around on their little\\nfeathered necks and saw perched beside them a big bird of a most\\nbeautiful blue color. At first they were a bit frightened, for the\\nnewcomer seemed of giant size beside their little lark bodies, and he\\nwas, moreover, quite fierce in appearance, having a crest of feathers\\nthat came to a point above his head, and a strong beak and sharp\\ntalons. But Twinkle looked full into the shrewd, bright eye, and found\\nit good humored and twinkling; so she plucked up courage and asked:\\n\\n\"Were you speaking to us?\"\\n\\n\"Very likely,\" replied the blue bird, in a cheerful tone. \"There\\'s no\\none else around to speak to.\"\\n\\n\"And was it you who warned us against that dreadful creature below in\\nthe forest?\" she continued.\\n\\n\"It was.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said Twinkle, \"we are very much obliged to you.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mention it,\" said the other. \"I\\'m the forest policeman--\\nPoliceman Bluejay, you know--and it\\'s my duty to look after everyone\\nwho is in trouble.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re in trouble, all right,\" said Chubbins, sorrowfully.\\n\\n\"Well, it might have been worse,\" remarked Policeman Bluejay, making a\\nchuckling sound in his throat that Twinkle thought was meant for a\\nlaugh. \"If you had ever touched the old tuxix she would have\\ntransformed you into toads or lizards. That is an old trick of hers, to\\nget children into her power and then change them into things as\\nloathsome as herself.\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t have touched her, anyhow,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Nor I!\" cried Chubbins, in his shrill, bird-like voice. \"She wasn\\'t\\nnice.\"\\n\\n\"Still, it was good of you to warn us,\" Twinkle added, sweetly.\\n\\nThe Bluejay looked upon the fluttering little things with kind\\napproval. Then he laughed outright.\\n\\n\"What has happened to your heads?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Nothing, \\'cept they\\'re smaller,\" replied Chubbins.\\n\\n\"But birds shouldn\\'t have human heads,\" retorted the bluejay. \"I\\nsuppose the old tuxix did that so the birds would not admit you into\\ntheir society, for you are neither all bird nor all human. But never\\nmind; I\\'ll explain your case, and you may be sure all the birds of the\\nforest will be kind to you.\"\\n\\n\"Must we stay like this always?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously.\\n\\n\"I really can\\'t say,\" answered the policeman. \"There is said to be a\\nway to break every enchantment, if one knows what it is. The trouble in\\nthese cases is to discover what the charm may be that will restore you\\nto your natural shapes. But just now you must make up your minds to\\nlive in our forest for a time, and to be as happy as you can under the\\ncircumstances.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll try,\" said Chubbins, with a sigh.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" exclaimed Policeman Bluejay, nodding his crest in\\napproval. \"The first thing you must have is a house; so, if you will\\nfly with me, I will try to find you one.\"\\n\\n\"I--I\\'m afraid!\" said Twinkle, nervously.\\n\\n\"The larks,\" declared the bluejay, \"are almost the strongest and best\\nflyers we have. You two children have now become skylarks, and may soar\\nso high in the air that you can scarcely see the earth below you. For\\nthat reason you need have no fear whatever. Be bold and brave, and all\\nwill be well.\"\\n\\nHe spoke in such a kindly and confident voice that both Twinkle and\\nChubbins gained courage; and when the policeman added: \"Come on!\" and\\nflew straight as an arrow into the air above the tree-tops, the two\\nlittle skylarks with their girl and boy heads followed swiftly after\\nhim, and had no trouble in going just as fast as their conductor.\\n\\nIt was quite a pleasant and interesting experience, to dart through the\\nair and be in no danger of falling. When they rested on their\\noutstretched wings they floated as lightly as bubbles, and soon a\\njoyous thrill took possession of them and they began to understand why\\nit is that the free, wild birds are always so happy in their native\\nstate.\\n\\nThe forest was everywhere under them, for it was of vast extent.\\nPresently the bluejay swooped downward and alighted near the top of a\\ntall maple tree that had many thick branches.\\n\\nIn a second Twinkle and Chubbins were beside him, their little hearts\\nbeating fast in their glossy bosoms from the excitement of their rapid\\nflight. Just in front of them, firmly fastened to a crotch of a limb,\\nwas a neatly built nest of a gray color, lined inside with some soft\\nsubstance that was as smooth as satin.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said their thoughtful friend, \"is the nest that Niddie Thrush\\nand Daisy Thrush built for themselves a year ago. They have now gone to\\nlive in a wood across the big river, so you are welcome to their old\\nhome. It is almost as good as new, and there is no rent to pay.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s awfully small!\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Chut-chut!\" twittered Policeman Bluejay. \"Remember you are not\\nchildren now, but skylarks, and that this is a thrush\\'s nest. Try it,\\nand you are sure to find it will fit you exactly.\"\\n\\nSo Twinkle and Chubbins flew into the \"house\" and nestled their bodies\\nagainst its soft lining and found that their friend was right. When\\nthey were cuddled together, with their slender legs tucked into the\\nfeathers of their breasts, they just filled the nest to the brim, and\\nno more room was necessary.\\n\\n\"Now, I\\'ll mark the nest for you, so that everyone will know you claim\\nit,\" said the policeman; and with his bill he pecked a row of small\\ndots in the bark of the limb, just beside the nest. \"I hope you will be\\nvery happy here, and this afternoon I will bring some friends to meet\\nyou. So now good-bye until I see you again.\"\\n\\n\"Wait!\" cried Chubbins. \"What are we going to eat?\"\\n\\n\"Eat!\" answered the bluejay, as if surprised. \"Why, you may feast upon\\nall the good things the forest offers--grubs, beetles, worms, and\\nbutterfly-eggs.\"\\n\\n\"Ugh!\" gasped Chubbins. \"It makes me sick to just think of it.\"\\n\\n\"What!\"\\n\\n\"You see,\" said Twinkle, \"we are not _all_ birds, Mr. Bluejay, as you\\nare; and that makes a big difference. We have no bills to pick up the\\nthings that birds like to eat, and we do not care for the same sort of\\nfood, either.\"\\n\\n\"What _do_ you care for?\" asked the policeman, in a puzzled voice.\\n\\n\"Why, cake and sandwitches, and pickles, and cheese, such as we had in\\nour basket. We couldn\\'t _eat_ any live things, you see, because we are\\nnot used to it.\"\\n\\nThe bluejay became thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I understand your objection,\" he said, \"and perhaps you are right, not\\nhaving good bird sense because the brains in your heads are still human\\nbrains. Let me see: what can I do to help you?\"\\n\\nThe children did not speak, but watched him anxiously.\\n\\n\"Where did you leave your basket?\" he finally asked.\\n\\n\"In the place where the old witch \\'chanted us.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the officer of the forest, \"I must try to get it for you.\"\\n\\n\"It is too big and heavy for a bird to carry,\" suggested Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Sure enough. Of course. That\\'s a fact.\" He turned his crested head\\nupward, trying to think of a way, and saw a black speck moving across\\nthe sky.\\n\\n\"Wait a minute! I\\'ll be back,\" he called, and darted upward like a\\nflash.\\n\\nThe children watched him mount into the sky toward the black speck, and\\nheard his voice crying out in sharp, quick notes. And before long\\nPoliceman Bluejay attracted the other bird\\'s attention, causing it to\\npause in its flight and sink slowly downward until the two drew close\\ntogether.\\n\\nThen it was seen that the other bird was a great eagle, strong and\\nsharp-eyed, and with broad wings that spread at least six feet from tip\\nto tip.\\n\\n\"Good day, friend eagle,\" said the bluejay; \"I hope you are in no\\nhurry, for I want to ask you to do me a great favor.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked the eagle, in a big, deep voice.\\n\\n\"Please go to a part of the forest with me and carry a basket to some\\nfriends of mine. I\\'ll show you the way. It is too heavy for me to lift,\\nbut with your great strength you can do it easily.\"\\n\\n\"It will give me pleasure to so favor you,\" replied the eagle,\\npolitely; so Policeman Bluejay led the way and the eagle followed with\\nsuch mighty strokes of its wings that the air was sent whirling in\\nlittle eddies behind him, as the water is churned by a steamer\\'s\\npaddles.\\n\\nIt was not very long before they reached the clearing in the forest.\\nThe horrid tuxix had wriggled her evil body away, to soothe her\\ndisappointment by some other wicked act; but the basket stood as the\\nchildren had left it.\\n\\nThe eagle seized the handle in his stout beak and found it was no\\ntrouble at all for him to fly into the air and carry the basket with\\nhim.\\n\\n\"This way, please--this way!\" chirped the bluejay; and the eagle bore\\nthe precious burden safely to the maple tree, and hung it upon a limb\\njust above the nest.\\n\\nAs he approached he made such a fierce fluttering that Twinkle and\\nChubbins were dreadfully scared and flew out of their nest, hopping\\nfrom limb to limb until they were well out of the monstrous bird\\'s way.\\nBut when they saw the basket, and realized the eagle\\'s kindly act, they\\nflew toward him and thanked him very earnestly for his assistance.\\n\\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed the eagle, turning his head first on one side\\nand then on the other, that both his bright eyes might observe the\\nchild-larks; \"what curious creatures have you here, my good policeman?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is another trick of old Hautau, the tuxix. She found two\\nchildren in the forest and enchanted them. She wanted to make them\\ntoads, but they wouldn\\'t touch her, so she couldn\\'t. Then she got\\nherself into a fine rage and made the little dears half birds and half\\nchildren, as you see them. I was in a tree near by, and saw the whole\\nthing. Because I was sorry for the innocent victims I befriended them,\\nand as this basket belongs to them I have asked you to fetch it to\\ntheir nest.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to be of service,\" replied the eagle. \"If ever you need me,\\nand I am anywhere around,\" he continued, addressing the larks, \"just\\ncall me, and I will come at once.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Twinkle, gratefully.\\n\\n\"We\\'re much obliged,\" added Chubbins.\\n\\nThen the eagle flew away, and when he was gone Policeman Bluejay also\\nbade them good-bye.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be back this afternoon, without fail,\" he said. \"Just now I must\\ngo and look over the forest, and make sure none of the birds have been\\nin mischief during my absence. Do not go very far from your nest, for a\\ntime, or you may get lost. The forest is a big place; but when you are\\nmore used to it and to your new condition you can be more bold in\\nventuring abroad.\"\\n\\n\"We won\\'t leave this tree,\" promised Twinkle, in an earnest voice.\\n\\nAnd Chubbins chimed in with, \"That\\'s right; we won\\'t leave this tree\\nuntil you come back.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" said the policeman.\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" responded Twinkle and Chubbins.\\n\\nSo the bluejay darted away and was soon lost to sight, and Twinkle and\\nChubbins were left alone to seriously consider the great misfortune\\nthat had overtaken them.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER III] _The Child-Larks_\\n\\n\"Folks will be worried about us, Twink,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"\\'Course they will,\" Twinkle replied. \"They\\'ll wonder what has become\\nof us, and try to find us.\"\\n\\n\"But they won\\'t look in the tree-tops.\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Nor think to ask the birds where we are.\"\\n\\n\"Why should they?\" enquired Twinkle. \"They can\\'t talk to the birds,\\nChub.\"\\n\\n\"Why not? We talk to them, don\\'t we? And they talk to us. At least, the\\np\\'liceman and the eagle did.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" answered Twinkle, \"and I don\\'t understand it a bit. I\\nmust ask Mr. Bluejay to \\'splain it to us.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the use of a p\\'liceman in the forest?\" asked Chubbins, after a\\nmoment\\'s thought.\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" she replied, \"that he has to keep the birds from being\\nnaughty. Some birds are just awful mischiefs, Chub. There\\'s the\\nmagpies, you know, that steal; and the crows that fight; and the\\njackdaws that are saucy, and lots of others that get into trouble.\\nSeems to me P\\'liceman Bluejay\\'s a pretty busy bird, if he looks after\\nthings as he ought.\"\\n\\n\"Prob\\'ly he\\'s got his hands full,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Not that; for he hasn\\'t any hands, any more than we have. Perhaps you\\nought to say he\\'s got his wings full,\" suggested Twinkle.\\n\\n\"That reminds me I\\'m hungry,\" chirped the boy-lark.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve got the basket,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"But how can we eat cake and things, witched up as we are?\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t we mouths and teeth, just the same as ever?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but we haven\\'t any hands, and there\\'s a cloth tied over the top\\nof the basket.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Twinkle; \"I hadn\\'t thought of that.\"\\n\\nThey flew together to the basket and perched upon the edge of it. It\\nseemed astonishingly big to them, now that they were so small; but\\nChubbins remarked that this fact was a pleasant one, for instead of\\neating all the good things the basket contained at one meal, as they\\nhad at first intended, it would furnish them with food for many days to\\ncome.\\n\\nBut how to get into the basket was the thing to be considered just now.\\nThey fluttered around on every side of it, and finally found a small\\nplace where the cloth was loose. In a minute Chubbins began clawing at\\nit with his little feet, and Twinkle helped him; so that gradually they\\nmanaged to pull the cloth away far enough for one of them to crawl\\nthrough the opening. Then the other followed, and because the big\\nbasket was not quite full there was exactly room for them to stand\\nunderneath the cloth and walk around on top of a row of cookies that\\nlay next to a row of sandwiches.\\n\\nThe cookies seemed enormous. One was lying flat, and Chubbins declared\\nit seemed as big around as the dining-table at home.\\n\\n\"All the better for us,\" said Twinkle, bending her head down to nibble\\nat the edge of the cookie.\\n\\n\"If we\\'re going to be birds,\" said Chubbins, who was also busily eating\\nas best he could, \"we ought to be reg\\'lar birds, and have bills to peck\\nwith. This being half one thing and half another doesn\\'t suit me at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"The witch wasn\\'t trying to suit us,\" replied Twinkle; \"she was trying\\nto get us into trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she did it, all right,\" he said.\\n\\nIt was not so hard to eat as they had feared, for their slender necks\\nenabled them to bend their heads low. Chubbins\\' hat fell off, a minute\\nlater, and he wondered how he was going to get it on his head again.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you stand on one foot, and use the other foot like a hand?\"\\nasked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said he.\\n\\n\"The storks stand on one leg,\" continued the girl. \"I\\'ve seen \\'em in\\npictures.\"\\n\\nSo Chubbins tried it, and found he could balance his little body on one\\nleg very nicely. For if he toppled either way he had but to spread his\\nwings and tail feathers and so keep himself from falling. He picked up\\nhis hat with the claws of his other foot and managed to put it on by\\nducking his head.\\n\\nThis gave the boy-lark a new idea. He broke off a piece of the cookie\\nand held it in his claw while he ate it; and seeing his success Twinkle\\nfollowed his example, and after a few attempts found she could eat very\\ncomfortably in that way.\\n\\nHaving had their luncheon--and it amazed Chubbins to see how very\\nlittle was required to satisfy their hunger--the bird-children crept\\nout of the basket and flew down to the twig beside their nest.\\n\\n\"Hello!\" cried a strange voice. \"Newcomers, eh?\"\\n\\nThey were so startled that they fluttered a moment to keep from\\ntumbling off the limb. Then Twinkle saw a furry red head sticking out\\nof a small hollow in the trunk of the tree. The head had two round\\nblack eyes, an inquisitive nose, a wide mouth with sharp teeth and\\nwhiskers like those of a cat. It seemed as big as the moon to the shy\\nlittle child-larks, until it occurred to the girl that the strange\\ncreature must be a squirrel.\\n\\n\"You--you scared us!\" she said, timidly.\\n\\n\"You scared _me,_ at first,\" returned the squirrel, in a comic tone.\\n\"Dear me! how came you birds to have children\\'s heads?\"\\n\\n\"That isn\\'t the way to put it,\" remarked Chubbins, staring back into\\nthe eyes of the squirrel. \"You should ask how we children happened to\\nhave birds\\' bodies.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; put the conundrum that way, if you like,\" said the\\nsquirrel. \"What is the answer?\"\\n\\n\"We are enchanted,\" replied Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Ah. The tuxix?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. We were caught in the forest, and she bewitched us.\"\\n\\n\"That is too bad,\" said their new acquaintance. \"She is a very wicked\\nold creature, for a fact, and loves to get folks into trouble. Are you\\ngoing to live here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl. \"Policeman Bluejay gave us this nest.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s all right; for Policeman Bluejay rules the feathered tribes\\nof this forest about as he likes. Have you seen him in full uniform\\nyet?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" they replied, \"unless his feathers are his uniform.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s too proud of his office to be satisfied with feathers, I\\ncan tell you. When some folks get a little authority they want all the\\nworld to know about it, and a bold uniform covers many a faint heart.\\nBut as I\\'m your nearest neighbor I\\'ll introduce myself. My name\\'s\\nWisk.\"\\n\\n\"My name is Twinkle.\"\\n\\n\"And mine\\'s Chubbins.\"\\n\\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance,\" said the squirrel, nodding. \"I\\nlive in the second flat.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" asked the boy.\\n\\n\"Why, the second hollow, you know. There\\'s a \\'possum living in the\\nhollow down below, who is carrying four babies around in her pocket;\\nand Mrs. Hootaway, the gray owl, lives in the hollow above--the one you\\ncan see far over your heads. So I\\'m the second flat tenant.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Early in the morning the \\'possum comes growling home to go to bed;\\nlate at night the owl hoots and keeps folks awake; but I\\'m very quiet\\nand well behaved, and you\\'ll find me a good neighbor,\" continued Wisk.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of that,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\nAs if to prove his friendship the squirrel now darted out of the hollow\\nand sat upon a limb beside the children, holding his bushy tail\\nstraight up so that it stood above his head like a big plume in a\\nsoldier\\'s helmet.\\n\\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked the girl.\\n\\n\"Not very. I cannot get much food until the nuts are ripe, you know,\\nand my last winter\\'s supply was gone long ago. But I manage to find\\nsome bits to eat, here and there.\"\\n\\n\"Do you like cookies?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"I really do not know,\" answered Wisk. \"Where do they grow?\"\\n\\n\"In baskets. I\\'ll get you a piece, and you can try it.\" So Twinkle flew\\nup and crept into her basket again, quickly returning with a bit of\\ncookie in her claw. It was not much more than a crumb, but nevertheless\\nit was all that she could carry.\\n\\nThe squirrel seized the morsel in his paws, examined it gravely, and\\nthen took a nibble. An instant later it was gone.\\n\\n\"That is very good, indeed!\" he declared. \"Where do these baskets of\\ncookies grow?\"\\n\\n\"They don\\'t grow anywhere,\" replied Twinkle, with a laugh. \"The baskets\\ncome from the grocery store, and my mama makes the cookies.\"\\n\\n\"Oh; they\\'re human food, then.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; would you like some more?\"\\n\\n\"Not just now,\" said Wisk. \"I don\\'t want to rob you, and it is foolish\\nto eat more than one needs, just because the food tastes good. But if I\\nget very hungry, perhaps I\\'ll ask you for another bite.\"\\n\\n\"Do,\" said the girl. \"You are welcome to what we have, as long as it\\nlasts.\"\\n\\n\"That is very kind of you,\" returned the squirrel.\\n\\nThey sat and talked for an hour, and Wisk told them stories of the\\nforest, and of the many queer animals and birds that lived there. It\\nwas all very interesting to the children, and they listened eagerly\\nuntil they heard a rushing sound in the air that sent Wisk scurrying\\nback into his hole.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER IV] _An Afternoon Reception_\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins stretched their little necks to see what was\\ncoming, and a moment later beheld one of the most gorgeous sights the\\nforest affords--a procession of all the bright-hued birds that live\\namong the trees or seek them for shelter.\\n\\nThey flew in pairs, one after the other, and at the head of the\\nprocession was their good friend Policeman Bluejay, wearing a\\npoliceman\\'s helmet upon his head and having a policeman\\'s club tucked\\nunderneath his left wing. The helmet was black and glossy and had a big\\nnumber \"1\" on the front of it, and a strap that passed under the\\nwearer\\'s bill and held it firmly in place. The club was fastened around\\nthe policeman\\'s wing with a cord, so that it could not get away when he\\nwas flying.\\n\\nThe birds were of many sizes and of various colorings. Some were much\\nlarger than the bluejay, but none seemed so proud or masterful, and all\\ndeferred meekly to the commands of the acknowledged guardian of the\\nforest.\\n\\nOne by one the pretty creatures alighted upon the limbs of the tree,\\nand the first thing they all did was to arrange their feathers properly\\nafter their rapid flight. Then the bluejay, who sat next to the\\nchild-larks, proceeded to introduce the guests he had brought to call\\nupon the newest inhabitants of his domain.\\n\\n\"This is Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast, one of our most aristocratic\\nfamilies,\" said he, swinging his club around in a circle until Chubbins\\nducked his head for fear it might hit him.\\n\\n\"You are welcome to our forest,\" chirped Robin, in a sedate and\\ndignified tone.\\n\\n\"And here is Mr. Goldfinch and his charming bride,\" continued the\\npoliceman.\\n\\n\"Ah, it is a pleasure to meet you,\" the goldfinch murmured, eyeing the\\nchild-larks curiously, but trying to be so polite that they would not\\nnotice his staring.\\n\\n\"Henny Wren and Jenny Wren,\" proceeded the policeman.\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins both bowed politely.\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" croaked a raven, in a hoarse voice, \"am I to wait all day\\nwhile you introduce those miserable little insignificant grub-eaters?\"\\n\\n\"Be quiet!\" cried Policeman Bluejay, sternly.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t,\" snapped the raven.\\n\\nIt happened so quickly that the children saw nothing before they heard\\nthe thump of the club against the raven\\'s head.\\n\\n\"Caw--waw--waw--waw! Murder! Help!\" screamed the big bird, and flew\\naway from the tree as swiftly as his ragged wings would carry him.\\n\\n\"Let him go,\" said a sweet brown mocking-bird. \"The rowdy is always\\ndisturbing our social gatherings, and no one will miss him if he\\ndoesn\\'t come back.\"\\n\\n\"He is not fit for polite society,\" added a nuthatcher, pruning her\\nscarlet wings complacently.\\n\\nSo the policeman tucked the club under his wing again and proceeded\\nwith the introductions, the pewees and the linnets being next presented\\nto the strangers, and then the comical little chicadees, the orioles,\\nbobolinks, thrushes, starlings and whippoorwills, the latter appearing\\nsleepy because, they explained, they had been out late the night\\nbefore.\\n\\nThese smaller birds all sat in rows on the limbs beside Twinkle and\\nChubbins; but seated upon the stouter limbs facing them were rows of\\nbigger birds who made the child-larks nervous by the sharp glances from\\ntheir round, bright eyes. Here were blackbirds, cuckoos, magpies,\\ngrosbeaks and wood-pigeons, all nearly as big and fierce-looking as\\nPoliceman Bluejay himself, and some so rugged and strong that it seemed\\nstrange they would submit to the orders of the officer of the law. But\\nthe policeman kept a sharp watch upon these birds, to see that they\\nattempted no mischievous pranks, and they must have been afraid of him\\nbecause they behaved very well after the saucy raven had left them.\\nEven the chattering magpies tried to restrain their busy tongues, and\\nthe blackbirds indulged in no worse pranks than to suddenly spread\\ntheir wings and try to push the pigeons off the branch.\\n\\nSeveral beautiful humming-birds were poised in the air above this\\ngathering, their bodies being motionless but their tiny wings\\nfluttering so swiftly that neither Twinkle nor Chubbins could see them\\nat all.\\n\\nPoliceman Bluejay, having finally introduced all the company to the\\nchild-larks, began to relate the story of their adventures, telling the\\nbirds how the wicked tuxix had transformed them into the remarkable\\nshapes they now possessed.\\n\\n\"For the honor of our race,\" he said, \"we must each and every one guard\\nthese little strangers carefully, and see that they come to no harm in\\nour forest. You must all pledge yourselves to befriend them on all\\noccasions, and if any one dares to break his promise he must fight with\\nme to the death--and you know very well what that means.\"\\n\\n\"We do,\" said a magpie, with a shrill laugh. \"You\\'ll treat us as you\\ndid Jim Crow. Eh?\"\\n\\nThe policeman did not notice this remark, but the other birds all\\nlooked grave and thoughtful, and began in turn to promise that they\\nwould take care to befriend the child-larks at all times. This ceremony\\nhaving been completed, the birds began to converse in a more friendly\\nand easy tone, so that Twinkle and Chubbins soon ceased to be afraid of\\nthem, and enjoyed very much their society and friendly chatter.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER V] _The Oriole\\'s Story_\\n\\n\"We are really very happy in this forest,\" said an oriole that sat next\\nto Twinkle, \"and we would have no fears at all did not the men with\\nguns, who are called hunters, come here now and then to murder us. They\\nare terribly wild and ferocious creatures, who have no hearts at all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they _must_ have hearts,\" said Twinkle, \"else they couldn\\'t live.\\nFor one\\'s heart has to beat to keep a person alive, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s their gizzards that beat,\" replied the oriole,\\nreflectively, \"for they are certainly heartless and very wicked. A\\ncousin of mine, Susie Oriole, had a very brave and handsome husband.\\nThey built a pretty nest together and Susie laid four eggs in it that\\nwere so perfect that she was very proud of them.\\n\\n\"The eggs were nearly ready to hatch when a great man appeared in the\\nforest and discovered Susie\\'s nest. Her brave husband fought\\ndesperately to protect their home, but the cruel man shot him, and he\\nfell to the ground dead. Even then Susie would not leave her pretty\\neggs, and when the man climbed the tree to get them she screamed and\\ntried to peck out his eyes. Usually we orioles are very timid, you\\nknow; so you can well understand how terrified Susie was to fight\\nagainst this giant foe. But he had a club in his hand, with which he\\ndealt my poor cousin such a dreadful blow that she was sent whirling\\nthrough the air and sank half unconscious into a bush a few yards away.\\n\\n\"After this the man stole the eggs from the nest, and also picked up\\nthe dead body of Susie\\'s husband and carried it away with him. Susie\\nrecovered somewhat from the blow she had received, and when she saw her\\neggs and her poor dead husband being taken away, she managed to flutter\\nalong after the man and followed him until he came to the edge of the\\nforest. There he had a horse tied to a tree, and he mounted upon the\\nbeast\\'s back and rode away through the open country. Susie followed\\nhim, just far enough away to keep the man in sight, without being\\nnoticed herself.\\n\\n\"By and bye he came to a big house, which he entered, closing the door\\nbehind him. Susie flew into a tree beside the house and waited\\nsorrowfully but in patience for a chance to find her precious ones\\nagain.\\n\\n\"The days passed drearily away, one after another, but in about a week\\nmy cousin noticed that one of the windows of the house had been left\\nopen. So she boldly left her tree and flew in at the window, and\\nluckily none of the people who lived in the house happened to be in the\\nroom.\\n\\n\"Imagine Susie\\'s surprise when she saw around the sides of the room\\nmany birds sitting silently upon limbs cut from trees, and among them\\nher own husband, as proud and beautiful as he had ever been before the\\ncruel man had killed him! She quickly flew to the limb and perched\\nbeside her loved one.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, my darling!\\' she cried, \\'how glad I am to have found you again,\\nand to see you alive and well when I had mourned you as dead. Come with\\nme at once, and we will return to our old home in the forest.\\'\\n\\n\"But the bird remained motionless and made no reply to her loving\\nwords. She thrust her bill beside his and tried to kiss him, but he did\\nnot respond to the caress and his body was stiff and cold.\\n\\n\"Then Susie uttered a cry of grief, and understood the truth. Her\\nhusband was indeed dead, but had been stuffed and mounted upon the limb\\nto appear as he had in life. Small wires had been pushed through his\\nlegs to make his poor body stand up straight, and to Susie\\'s horror she\\ndiscovered that his eyes were only bits of glass! All the other birds\\nin the room were stuffed in the same way. They looked as if they were\\nalive, at the first glance; but each body was cold and every voice\\nmute. They were mere mockeries of the beautiful birds that this\\nheartless and cruel man had deprived of their joyous lives.\\n\\n\"Susie\\'s loving heart was nearly bursting with pain as she slowly\\nfluttered toward the open window by which she had entered. But on her\\nway a new anguish overtook her, for she noticed a big glass case\\nagainst the wall in which were arranged clusters of eggs stolen from\\nbirds of almost every kind. Yes; there were her own lovely eggs,\\nscarcely an inch from her face, but separated from her by a stout glass\\nthat could not be broken, although she madly dashed her body against it\\nagain and again.\\n\\n\"Finally, realizing her helplessness, poor Susie left the room by the\\nopen window and flew back to the forest, where she told us all the\\nterrible thing she had seen. No one was able to comfort her, for her\\nloving heart was broken; and after that she would often fly away to the\\nhouse to peer through the window at her eggs and her beautiful husband.\\n\\n\"One day she did not return, and after waiting for her nearly two weeks\\nwe sent the bluejay to see what had become of her. Our policeman found\\nthe house, and also found the window of the room open.\\n\\n\"He boldly entered, and discovered Susie and her husband sitting side\\nby side upon the dried limb, their bodies both stiff and dead. The man\\nhad caught the poor wife at last, and the lovers were reunited in\\ndeath.\\n\\n\"Also Policeman Bluejay found his grandfather\\'s mummy in this room, and\\nthe stuffed mummies of many other friends he had known in the forest.\\nSo he was very sorrowful when he returned to us, and from that time we\\nhave feared the heartless men more than ever.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a sad story,\" sighed Twinkle, \"and I\\'ve no doubt it is a true\\none. But all men are not so bad, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\"All men who enter the forest are,\" answered the oriole, positively.\\n\"For they only come here to murder and destroy those who are helpless\\nbefore their power, but have never harmed them in the least. If God\\nloves the birds, as I am sure He does, why do you suppose He made their\\nferocious enemies, the men?\"\\n\\nTwinkle did not reply, but she felt a little ashamed.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER VI] _A Merry Adventure_\\n\\n\"Talking about men,\" said the cuckoo, in a harsh but not very\\nunpleasant voice, \"reminds me of a funny adventure I once had myself. I\\nwas sitting in my nest one day, at the time when I was quite young,\\nwhen suddenly a man appeared before me. You must know that this nest,\\nwhich was rather carelessly built by my mother, was in a thick\\nevergreen tree, and not very high from the ground; so that I found the\\nman\\'s eyes staring squarely into my own.\\n\\n\"Most of you, my dears, have seen men; but this was the strangest sort\\nof man you can imagine. There was white hair upon his face, so long\\nthat it hung down to his middle, and over his eyes were round plates\\nof glass that glittered very curiously. I was so astonished at seeing\\nthe queer creature that I sat still and stared, and this was my\\nundoing. For suddenly there came a rapid \\'whish!\\' through the air, and\\na network of cords fell all around and over me. Then, indeed, I spread\\nmy wings and attempted to fly; but it was too late. I struggled in the\\nnet without avail, and soon gave up the conflict in breathless despair.\\n\\n\"My captor did not intend to kill me, however. Instead, he tried to\\nsoothe my fright, and carried me very gently for many, many miles,\\nuntil we came to a village of houses. Here, at the very top of a high\\nhouse, the man lived in one little room. It was all littered with tools\\nand bits of wood, and on a broad shelf were several queer things that\\nwent \\'tick-tock! tick-tock!\\' every minute. I was thrust, gently enough,\\ninto a wooden cage, where I lay upon the bottom more dead than alive\\nbecause the ticking things at first scared me dreadfully and I was in\\nconstant terror lest I should be tortured or killed. But the glass-eyed\\nold man brought me dainty things to eat, and plenty of fresh water to\\nrelieve my thirst, and by the next day my heart had stopped going\\npitty-pat and I was calm enough to stand up in my cage and look around\\nme.\\n\\n\"My white-whiskered captor sat at a bench with his coat off and his\\nbald head bare, while he worked away busily putting little wheels and\\nsprings together, and fitting them into a case of wood. When one of\\nthem was finished it would sing \\'tick-tock! tick-tock!\\' just like the\\nother queer things on the shelf, and this constant ticking so\\ninterested me that I raised my head and called:\\n\\n\"\\'Cuck-oo! cuck-oo!\\'\"\\n\\n\"\\'That\\'s it!\\' cried the old man, delightedly. \\'That\\'s what I wanted to\\nhear. It\\'s the real cuckoo at last, and not a bit like those cheap\\nimitations.\\'\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t understand at first what he meant, but he worked at his bench\\nall day, and finally brought to my cage a bird made out of wood, that\\nwas carved and painted to look just as I was. It seemed so natural that\\nI flapped my wings and called \\'cuck-oo\\' to it, and the man pressed a\\nlittle bellows at the bottom of the bird and made it say \\'cuck-oo!\\' in\\nreturn. But that cry was so false and unreal that I just shouted with\\nlaughter, and the glass-eyed old man shook his head sadly and said:\\n\\'That will never do. That will never do in the world.\\'\\n\\n\"So all the next day he worked hard trying to make his wooden bird say\\n\\'cuck-oo!\\' in the proper way; and at last it really spoke quite\\nnaturally, so that it startled even me when I heard it. This seemed to\\nplease my captor very much; so he put it inside one of the ticking\\nthings on the shelf, and by-and-by a door opened and the wooden bird\\njumped out and cried \\'Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo!\\' and then jumped back\\nagain and the door closed with a snap.\\n\\n\"\\'Bravo!\\' cried old white-hair; but I was rather annoyed, for I thought\\nthe wooden bird was impudent in trying to ape the ways of live cuckoos.\\nI shouted back a challenge to it, but there was no reply. An hour\\nlater, and every hour, it repeated the performance, but jumped behind\\nthe door when I offered to fight it.\\n\\n\"The next day the man was absent from the room, and I had nothing to\\neat. So I became angry and uneasy. I scratched away at the wooden bars\\nof my cage and tried to twist them with my beak, and at last one of\\nthem, to my great joy, came loose, and I was able to squeeze myself out\\nof the cage.\\n\\n\"But then I was no better off than before, because the windows and the\\ndoor of the room were fast shut. I grew more cross and ill-tempered\\nthan before, when I discovered this, and to add to my annoyance that\\nmiserable wooden bird would every once in awhile jump out and yell\\n\\'Cuck-oo!\\' and then bounce back into its house again, without daring to\\nargue with me.\\n\\n\"This at last made me frantic with rage, and I resolved to be revenged.\\nThe next time the wooden bird made its appearance I new upon it in a\\nflash and knocked it off the little platform before it had uttered its\\ncry more than twice. It fell upon the floor and broke one of its wings;\\nbut in an instant I dashed myself upon it and bit and scratched the\\nimpudent thing until there was not a bit of paint left upon it. Its\\nhead came off, too, and so did its legs and the other wing, and before\\nI was done with it no one ever would have known it was once a clever\\nimitation of myself. Finding that I was victorious I cried \\'Cuck-oo!\\'\\nin triumph, and just then the little door of the ticking thing opened\\nand the platform where the wooden bird had stood came out of it and\\nremained for a time motionless. I quickly flew up and perched upon it,\\nand shouted \\'Cuck-oo!\\' again, in great glee. As I did so, to my\\namazement the platform on which I stood leaped backward, carrying me\\nwith it, and the next instant the door closed with a snap and I found\\nmyself in darkness.\\n\\n\"Wildly I fluttered my wings; but it was of no use. I was in a prison\\nmuch worse than the cage, and so small that I could hardly turn around\\nin it. I was about to die of terror and despair when I chanced to\\nremember that at certain times the door would open to push out the bird\\nand allow it to say \\'Cuck-oo!\\' before it shut again. So, the next time\\nit opened in this way, I would be able to make my escape.\\n\\n\"Very patiently I waited in the dark little hole, listening to the\\nsteady \\'tick-tock!\\' of the machinery behind me and trying not to be\\nnervous. After awhile I heard the old man come into the room and\\nexclaim sorrowfully because his captive cuckoo had escaped from its\\ncage. He could not imagine what had become of me, and I kept still and\\nlaughed to myself to think how I would presently surprise him.\\n\\n\"It seemed an age before I finally heard the click that opened the door\\nin front of me. Then the platform on which I sat sprang out, and I\\nfluttered my wings and yelled \\'Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo!\\' as loud as I could.\\nThe old man was standing right in front of me, his mouth wide open with\\nastonishment at the wonderfully natural performance of his wooden bird,\\nas he thought me. He shouted \\'Bravo!\\' again, and clapped his hands; and\\nat that I flew straight into his face, and clawed his white hair with\\nall my might, and screamed as loud as I could.\\n\\n\"He screamed, too, being taken by surprise, and tumbled over backward\\nso that he sat down upon the floor with a loud bump. I flew to the\\nwork-bench, and then the truth dawned upon him that I was not the\\nwooden bird but the real one.\\n\\n\"\\'Good gracious!\\' said he, \\'I\\'ve left the window open. The rascal will\\nescape!\\'\\n\\n\"I glanced at the window and saw that it was indeed wide open. The\\nsight filled me with triumphant joy. Before the old man could get upon\\nhis feet and reach the window I had perched upon the sill, and with one\\nparting cry of \\'Cuck-oo!\\' I spread my wings and flew straight into the\\nair.\\n\\n\"Well, I never went back to enquire if he enjoyed the trick I had\\nplayed upon him, but I\\'ve laughed many a time when I thought of the old\\nfellow\\'s comic expression when a real cuckoo instead of a painted one\\nflew out of his ticking machine.\"\\n\\nAs the cuckoo ended his tale the other birds joined in a chorus of\\nshrill laughter; but Chubbins said to them, gravely:\\n\\n\"He was a smart man, though, to make a cuckoo-clock. I saw one myself,\\none time, and it was a wonderful thing. The cuckoo told what time it\\nwas every hour.\"\\n\\n\"Was it made of wood?\" asked the bluejay.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that,\" replied the boy-lark; \"but of course it wasn\\'t a\\nreal bird.\"\\n\\n\"It only shows,\" remarked the bobolink, \"how greatly those humans\\nadmire us birds. They make pictures of us, and love to keep us in cages\\nso they can hear us sing, and they even wear us in their bonnets after\\nwe are dead.\"\\n\\n\"I think that is a dreadful thing,\" said the goldfinch, with a shudder.\\n\"But it only proves that men are our greatest enemies.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t forget the women,\" said Twinkle. \"It\\'s the women that wear birds\\nin their hats.\"\\n\\n\"Mankind,\" said Robin Redbreast, gravely, \"is the most destructive and\\nbloodthirsty of all the brute creation. They not only kill for food,\\nbut through vanity and a desire for personal adornment. I have even\\nheard it said that they kill for amusement, being unable to restrain\\ntheir murderous desires. In this they are more cruel than the\\nserpents.\"\\n\\n\"There is some excuse for the poor things,\" observed the bluejay, \"for\\nnature created them dependent upon the animals and birds and fishes.\\nHaving neither fur nor feathers to protect their poor skinny bodies,\\nthey wear clothing made of the fleece of sheep, and skins of seals and\\nbeavers and otters and even the humble muskrats. They cover their feet\\nand their hands with skins of beasts; they sleep upon the feathers of\\nbirds; their food is the flesh of beasts and birds and fishes. No\\ncreated thing is so dependent upon others as man; therefore he is the\\ngreatest destroyer in the world. But he is not alone in his murderous,\\ndespoiling instinct. While you rail at man, my friends, do not forget\\nthat birds are themselves the greatest enemies of birds.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" cried the magpie, indignantly.\\n\\n\"Perhaps the less you say about this matter the better,\" declared the\\nbluejay, swinging his club in a suggestive manner, and looking sharply\\nat the magpie.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a slander,\" said the blackbird. \"I\\'m sure you can\\'t accuse _me_\\nof injuring birds in any way.\"\\n\\n\"If you are all innocent, why are we obliged to have a policeman?\"\\nenquired the little wren, in a nervous voice.\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" said Twinkle, appealing to the bluejay; \"are the big birds\\nreally naughty to the little ones?\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is the same with us as it is with men,\" replied the policeman.\\n\"There are good ones and bad ones among us, and the bad ones have to be\\nwatched. Men destroy us wantonly; other animals and the sly serpents\\nprey upon us and our eggs for food; but these are open enemies, and we\\nknow how we may best avoid them. Our most dangerous foes are those\\nbandits of our own race who, instead of protecting their brethren,\\nsteal our eggs and murder our young. They are not always the biggest\\nbirds, by any means, that do these things. The crow family is known to\\nbe treacherous, and the shrike is rightly called the \\'butcher-bird,\\'\\nbut there are many others that we have reason to suspect feed upon\\ntheir own race.\"\\n\\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed the girl-lark.\\n\\nThe birds all seemed restless and uneasy at this conversation, and\\nlooked upon one another with suspicious glances. But the bluejay\\nsoothed them by saying:\\n\\n\"After all, I suppose we imagine more evil than really exists, and\\nsometimes accuse our neighbors wrongfully. But the mother birds know\\nhow often their nests have been robbed in their absence, and if they\\nsuspect some neighbor of the crime instead of a prowling animal it is\\nbut natural, since many birds cannot be trusted. There are laws in the\\nforest, of course; but the guilty ones are often able to escape. I\\'ll\\ntell you of a little tragedy that happened only last week, which will\\nprove how apt we are to be mistaken.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER VII] _The Bluejay\\'s Story_\\n\\n\"There is no more faithful mother in the forest than the blue titmouse,\\nwhich is a cousin to the chickadee,\" continued the policeman, \"and this\\nspring Tom Titmouse and his wife Nancy set up housekeeping in a little\\nhollow in an elm-tree about half a mile north of this spot. Of course,\\nthe first thing Nancy did was to lay six beautiful eggs--white with\\nbrown spots all over them--in the nest. Tom was as proud of these eggs\\nas was Nancy, and as the nest was hidden in a safe place they flew away\\ntogether to hunt for caterpillars, and had no thought of danger. But on\\ntheir return an hour later what was their sorrow to find the nest\\nempty, and every pretty egg gone. On the ground underneath the tree\\nwere scattered a few bits of shell; but the robber was nowhere to be\\nseen.\\n\\n\"Tom Titmouse was very indignant at this dreadful crime, and came to me\\nat once to complain of the matter; but of course I had no idea who had\\ndone the deed. I questioned all the birds who have ever been known to\\nslyly steal eggs, and every one denied the robbery. So Nancy Titmouse\\nsaw she must lay more eggs, and before long had another six speckled\\nbeauties in the bottom of her nest.\\n\\n\"They were more careful now about leaving home; but the danger seemed\\npast. One bright, sunny morning they ventured to fly to the brook to\\ndrink and bathe themselves, and on their return found their home\\ndespoiled for a second time. Not an egg was left to them out of the\\nsix, and while Nancy wept and wailed Tom looked sharply around him and\\nsaw a solitary shrike sitting on a limb not far away.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s a shrike?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"It is a bird that looks a good deal like that mocking-bird sitting\\nnext you; but it bears a bad character in the forest and has earned the\\nvile name of \\'butcher-bird.\\' I admit that I am always obliged to keep\\nan eye upon the shrike, for I expect it to get into mischief at any\\ntime. Well, Tom Titmouse naturally thought the shrike had eaten Nancy\\'s\\neggs, so he came to me and ordered me to arrest the robber. But the\\nshrike pleaded his innocence, and I had no proof against him.\\n\\n\"Again Nancy, with true motherly courage and perseverance, laid her\\neggs in the nest; and now they were never left alone for a single\\nminute. Either she or Tom was always at home, and for my part I watched\\nthe shrike carefully and found he did not fly near the nest of the\\ntitmice at all.\\n\\n\"The result of our care was that one fine day the eggs hatched out, and\\nsix skinny little titmice, with big heads and small bodies, were\\nnestling against Nancy\\'s breast. The mother thought they were\\nbeautiful, you may be sure, and many birds gathered around to\\ncongratulate her and Tom, and the brown thrush sang a splendid song of\\nwelcome to the little ones.\\n\\n\"When the children got a little stronger it did not seem necessary to\\nguard the nest so closely, and the six appetites required a good many\\ninsects and butterfly-eggs to satisfy them. So Tom and Nancy both flew\\naway to search for food, and when they came back they found, to their\\nhorror, that their six little ones had been stolen, and the nest was\\nbare and cold. Nancy nearly fainted with sorrow, and her cries were\\npitiful and heart-rending; but Tom Titmouse was dreadfully angry, and\\ncame to me demanding vengeance.\\n\\n\"\\'If you are any good at all as a policeman,\\' said he, \\'you will\\ndiscover and punish the murderer of my babies.\\'\\n\\n\"So I looked all around and finally discovered, not far from the nest\\nof the titmice, four of their children, all dead and each one impaled\\nupon the thorn of a bush that grew close to the ground. Then I decided\\nit was indeed the shrike, for he has a habit of doing just this thing;\\nkilling more than he can eat and sticking the rest of his murdered\\nvictims on thorns until he finds time to come back and devour them.\\n\\n\"I was also angry, by that time; so I flew to the shrike\\'s nest and\\nfound him all scratched and torn and his feathers plucked in many\\nplaces.\\n\\n\"\\'What has happened to you?\\' I asked.\\n\\n\"\\'I had a fight with a weasel last night,\\' answered the shrike, \\'and\\nboth of us are rather used up, today.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Still,\\' said I, sternly, \\'you had strength enough to kill the six\\nlittle titmice, and to eat two of them.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I never did,\\' said he, earnestly; \\'my wings are too stiff to fly.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Do not lie about it, I beg of you,\\' said I; \\'for we have found four\\nof the dead titmice stuck on the thorns of a bush, and your people have\\nbeen known to do such things before.\\'\\n\\n\"At this the shrike looked worried.\\n\\n\"\\'Really,\\' said he, \\'I cannot understand it. But I assure you I am\\ninnocent.\\'\\n\\n\"Nevertheless, I arrested him, and made him fly with me to the Judgment\\nTree, where all the birds had congregated. He was really stiff and\\nsore, and I could see it hurt him to fly; but my duty was plain. We\\nselected a jury of twelve birds, and Judge Bullfinch took his seat on a\\nbough, and then the trial began.\\n\\n\"Tom Titmouse accused the shrike of murder, and so did Nancy, who had\\nnearly cried her eyes out. I also gave my evidence. But the prisoner\\ninsisted strongly that he was innocent, and claimed he had not left his\\nnest since his fight with the weasel, and so was guiltless of the\\ncrime.\\n\\n\"But no one had any sympathy for him, or believed what he said; for it\\nis often the case that when one has earned a bad character he is\\nthought capable of any wickedness. So the jury declared him guilty, and\\nthe judge condemned him to die at sundown. We were all to fall upon the\\nprisoner together, and tear him into bits with bill and claw; but while\\nwe waited for the sun to sink Will Sparrow flew up to the Judgment Tree\\nand said:\\n\\n\"\\'Hello! What\\'s going on here?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'We are just about to execute a criminal,\\' replied the judge.\\n\\n\"\\'What has he been doing?\\' asked Will, eyeing the shrike curiously.\\n\\n\"\\'He killed the titmice children this morning, and ate two of them, and\\nstuck the other four upon a thorn bush,\\' explained the judge.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, no; the shrike did not do that!\\' cried Will Sparrow. \\'I saw the\\ncrime committed with my own eyes, and it was the cunning weasel--the\\none that lives in the pine stump--that did the dreadful murder.\\'\\n\\n\"At this all the birds set up an excited chatter, and the shrike again\\nscreamed that he was innocent. So the judge said, gravely: \\'Will\\nSparrow always speaks the truth. Release the prisoner, for we have\\nmisjudged him. We must exact our vengeance upon the weasel.\\'\\n\\n\"So we all flew swiftly to the pine stump, which we knew well, and when\\nwe arrived we found the weasel sitting at the edge of his hole and\\nlaughing at us.\\n\\n\"\\'That is the very weasel I fought with,\\' said the shrike. \\'You can see\\nwhere I tore the fur from his head and back with my sharp beak.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'So you did,\\' answered the weasel; \\'and in return I killed the little\\ntomtits.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Did you stick them on the thorns?\\' asked Judge Bullfinch.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes,\\' said the weasel. \\'I hoped you would accuse the shrike of the\\nmurder, and kill him to satisfy my vengeance.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'We nearly fell into the trap,\\' returned the judge; \\'but Will Sparrow\\nsaw your act and reported it just in time to save the shrike\\'s life.\\nBut tell me, did you also eat Nancy Titmouse\\'s eggs?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Of course,\\' confessed the weasel, \\'and they were very good, indeed.\\'\\n\\n\"Hearing this, Tom Titmouse became so excited that he made a furious\\ndash at the weasel, who slipped within his hole and escaped.\\n\\n\"\\'I condemn you to death!\\' cried the judge.\\n\\n\"\\'That\\'s all right,\\' answered the weasel, sticking just the tip of his\\nnose out of the hole. \\'But you\\'ve got to catch me before you can kill\\nme. Run home, my pretty birds. You\\'re no match for a weasel!\\'\\n\\n\"Then he was gone from sight, and we knew he was hidden safely in the\\nstump, where we could not follow him, for the weasel\\'s body is slim and\\nslender. But I have not lived in the forest all my life without\\nlearning something, and I whispered a plan to Judge Bullfinch that met\\nwith his approval. He sent messengers at once for the ivory-billed\\nwoodpeckers, and soon four of those big birds appeared and agreed to\\nhelp us. They began tearing away at the stump with their strong beaks,\\nand the splinters flew in every direction. It was not yet dark when the\\ncunning weasel was dragged from his hole and was at the mercy of the\\nbirds he had so cruelly offended. We fell upon him in a flash, and he\\nwas dead almost instantly.\"\\n\\n\"What became of the shrike?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"He left the forest the next day,\" answered Policeman Bluejay. \"For\\nalthough he was innocent of this crime, he was still a butcher-bird,\\nand he knew our people had no confidence in him.\"\\n\\n\"It was lucky Will Sparrow came in time,\" said the girl-lark. \"But all\\nthese stories must have made you hungry, so I\\'d like to invite my\\nguests to have some refreshments.\"\\n\\nThe birds seemed much surprised by this invitation, and even Policeman\\nBluejay wondered what she was going to do. But Twinkle whispered to\\nChubbins, and both the bird-children flew into their basket and\\nreturned with their claws full of cookie. They repeated the journey\\nmany times, distributing bits of the rare food to all of the birds who\\nhad visited them, and each one ate the morsel eagerly and declared that\\nit was very good.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said the policeman, when the feast was over, \"let us all go to\\nthe brook and have a drink of its clear, sweet water.\"\\n\\nSo they flew away, a large and merry band of all sizes and colors; and\\nthe child-larks joined them, skimming the air as lightly and joyously\\nas any of their new friends. It did not take them long to reach a\\nsparkling brook that wound its way through the forest, and all the\\nfeathered people drank their fill standing upon the low bank or upon\\nstones that rose above the level of the water.\\n\\nAt first the children were afraid they might fall into the brook; but\\npresently they gained courage, and when they saw the thrush and\\nbullfinch plunge in and bathe themselves in the cool water Chubbins\\ndecided to follow their example, and afterward Twinkle also joined\\nthem.\\n\\nThe birds now bade the child-larks good-bye and promised to call upon\\nthem again, and soon all had flown away except the bluejay, who said he\\nwould see Twinkle and Chubbins safe home again, so that they would not\\nget lost.\\n\\nThey thanked him for this kindness, and when they had once more settled\\nupon the limb beside their nest the bluejay also bade them good night\\nand darted away for one last look through the forest to see that all\\nwas orderly for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER VIII] _Mrs. Hootaway_\\n\\nAs the child-larks sat side by side upon their limb, with the soft gray\\nnest near at hand, the twilight fell and a shadow began to grow and\\ndeepen throughout the forest.\\n\\n\"Twink,\" said Chubbins, gravely, \"how do you like it?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the girl, \"it isn\\'t so bad in the daytime, but it\\'s\\nworse at night. That bunch of grass mixed up with the stems of leaves,\\nthat they call a nest, isn\\'t much like my pretty white bed at home,\\nChubbins.\"\\n\\n\"Nor mine,\" he agreed. \"And, Twink, how ever can we say our prayers\\nwhen we haven\\'t any hands to hold up together?\"\\n\\n\"Prayers, Chub,\" said the girl, \"are more in our hearts than in our\\nhands. It isn\\'t what we _do_ that counts; it\\'s what we feel. But the\\nmost that bothers me is what the folks at home will think, when we\\ndon\\'t come back.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ll hunt for us,\" Chubbins suggested; \"and they may come under\\nthis tree, and call to us.\"\\n\\n\"If they do,\" said Twinkle, \"we\\'ll fly right down to them.\"\\n\\n\"I advise you not to fly much, in the night,\" said a cheery voice\\nbeside them, and Wisk the squirrel stuck his head out of the hollow\\nwhere he lived. \"You\\'ve had quite a party here today,\" he continued,\\n\"and they behaved pretty well while the policeman was around. But some\\nof them might not be so friendly if you met them alone.\"\\n\\n\"Would any bird hurt us?\" asked the girl, in surprise.\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve seen a magpie meet a thrush, and fly away alone,\" replied\\nWisk. \"And the wrens and chickadees avoid the cuckoo as much as\\npossible, because they are fond of being alive. But the policeman keeps\\nthe big birds all in order when he is around, and he makes them all\\nafraid to disobey the laws. He\\'s a wonderful fellow, that Policeman\\nBluejay, and even we squirrels are glad he is in the forest.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Well, we also fear some of the birds,\" answered Wisk. \"The lady in the\\nthird flat, for instance, Mrs. Hootaway, is said to like a squirrel for\\na midnight meal now and then, when mice and beetles are scarce. It is\\nalmost her hour for wakening, so I must be careful to keep near home.\"\\n\\n\"Tut--tut--tut!\" cried a harsh voice from above. \"What scandal is this\\nyou are talking, Mr. Wisk?\"\\n\\nThe squirrel was gone in a flash; but a moment later he put out his\\nhead again and turned one bright eye toward the upper part of the tree.\\nThere, on a perch outside her hollow, sat the gray owl, pruning her\\nfeathers. It was nearly dark by this time, and through the dusk Mrs.\\nHootaway\\'s yellow eyes could be seen gleaming bright and wide open.\\n\\n\"What nonsense are you putting into the heads of these little\\ninnocents?\" continued the owl, in a scolding tone.\\n\\n\"No nonsense at all,\" said Wisk, in reply. \"The child-larks are safe\\nenough from you, because they are under the protection of Policeman\\nBluejay, and he would have a fine revenge if you dared to hurt them.\\nBut my case is different. The laws of the birds do not protect\\nsquirrels, and when you\\'re abroad, my dear Mrs. Hootaway, I prefer to\\nremain snugly at home.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure,\" remarked the owl, with a laugh. \"You are timid and\\nsuspicious by nature, my dear Wisk, and you forget that although I have\\nknown you for a long time I have never yet eaten you.\"\\n\\n\"That is my fault, and not yours,\" retorted the squirrel.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not after you tonight, neighbor, nor after birds, either. I\\nknow where there are seven fat mice to be had, and until they are all\\ngone you may cease to worry.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad to hear that,\" replied Wisk. \"I wish there were seven hundred\\nmice to feed your appetite. But I\\'m not going to run into danger\\nrecklessly, nevertheless, and it is my bed-time. So good night, Mrs.\\nHootaway; and good night, little child-larks.\" The owl did not reply,\\nbut Twinkle and Chubbins called good night to the friendly squirrel,\\nand then they hopped into their nest and cuddled down close together.\\n\\nThe moon was now rising over the trees and flooding the gloom of the\\nforest with its subdued silver radiance. The children were not sleepy;\\ntheir new life was too strange and wonderful for them to be able to\\nclose their eyes at once. So they were rather pleased when the gray owl\\nsettled on the branch beside their nest and began to talk to them.\\n\\n\"I\\'m used to slanders, my dears,\" she said, in a pleasanter tone than\\nshe had used before, \"so I don\\'t mind much what neighbor Wisk says to\\nme. But I do not wish you to think ill of the owl family, and so I must\\nassure you that we are as gentle and kindly as any feathered creatures\\nin the forest--not excepting the Birds of Paradise.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure of that,\" replied Twinkle, earnestly. \"You are too soft and\\nfluffy and pretty to be bad.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the prettiness,\" said the gray owl, evidently pleased by the\\ncompliment. \"It is the nature of owls to be kind and sympathetic. Those\\nwho do not know us very well say harsh things about us, because we fly\\nin the night, when most other birds are asleep, and sleep in the\\ndaytime when most other birds are awake.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you do that?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Because the strong light hurts our eyes. But, although we are abroad\\nin the night, we seek only our natural prey, and obey the Great Law of\\nthe forest more than some others do.\"\\n\\n\"What is the Great Law?\" enquired Twinkle, curiously.\\n\\n\"Love. It is the moral law that is above all laws made by living\\ncreatures. The whole forest is ruled by love more than it is by fear.\\nYou may think this is strange when you remember that some animals eat\\nbirds, and some birds eat animals, and the dreadful creeping things eat\\nus both; but nevertheless we are so close to Nature here that love and\\ntenderness for our kind influences us even more than it does mankind--\\nthe careless and unthinking race from which you came. The residents of\\nthe forest are good parents, helpful neighbors, and faithful friends.\\nWhat better than this could be said of us?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, I\\'m sure, if it is true,\" replied the girl.\\n\\n\"Over in the Land of Paradise,\" continued the owl, thoughtfully, \"the\\nbirds are not obliged to take life in order to live themselves; so they\\ncall us savage and fierce. But I believe our natures are as kindly as\\nthose of the Birds of Paradise.\"\\n\\n\"Where is this Land of Paradise you speak of?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Directly in the center of our forest. It is a magical spot, protected\\nfrom intrusion not by any wall or barred gates, but by a strong wind\\nthat blows all birds away from that magnificent country except the\\nBirds of Paradise themselves. There is a legend that man once lived\\nthere, but for some unknown crime was driven away. But the birds have\\nalways been allowed to inhabit the place because they did no harm.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see it,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"So would I,\" confessed the gray owl, with a sigh; \"but there is no use\\nof my attempting to get into the Paradise of Birds, because the wind\\nwould blow me back. But now it is getting quite dark, and I must be off\\nto seek my food. Mrs. \\'Possum and I have agreed to hunt together,\\ntonight.\"\\n\\n\"Who is Mrs. \\'Possum?\" the girl asked.\\n\\n\"An animal living in the lowest hollow of this tree,\" answered the owl.\\n\"She is a good-natured creature, and hunts by night, as I do. She is\\nslow, but, being near the ground, she can spy a mouse much quicker than\\nI can, and then she calls to me to catch it. So between us we get\\nplenty of game and are helpful to each other. The only drawback is that\\nMrs. \\'Possum has four children, which she carries in her pouch wherever\\nshe goes, and they have to be fed as well as their mother. So the\\n\\'possums have five mouths to my one, and it keeps us busy to supply\\nthem all.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very kind of you to help her,\" remarked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Oh, she helps me, too,\" returned the owl, cheerfully. \"But now good\\nnight, my dears. You will probably be sound asleep when I get home\\nagain.\"\\n\\nOff flew Mrs. Hootaway with these words, and her wings moved so\\nnoiselessly that she seemed to fade away into the darkness like a\\nghost.\\n\\nThe child-larks sat looking at the silver moon for a time; but\\npresently Twinkle\\'s eyelids drooped and she fell fast asleep, and\\nChubbins was not long in following her example.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER IX] _The Destroyers_\\n\\nA loud shouting and a bang that echoed like a clap of thunder through\\nthe forest awoke the bird-children from their dreams.\\n\\nOpening their eyes with a start they saw that the gray dawn was\\nbreaking and a sort of morning twilight made all objects in the forest\\ndistinct, yet not so brilliant as the approaching daylight would.\\nShadows still lay among the bushes and the thickest branches; but\\nbetween the trees the spaces were clearly visible.\\n\\nThe children, rudely awakened by the riot of noise in their ears, could\\ndistinguish the barking of dogs, the shouts of men calling to the\\nbrutes, and the scream of an animal in deep distress. Immediately\\nafter, there was a whirl overhead and the gray owl settled on the limb\\nbeside their nest.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve got her!\" she exclaimed, in a trembling, terrified voice. \"The\\nmen have shot Mrs. \\'Possum dead, and the dogs are now tearing her four\\nbabies limb from limb!\"\\n\\n\"Where are they?\" whispered Twinkle, her little heart beating as\\nviolently as if the dread destroyers had always been her mortal\\nenemies.\\n\\n\"Just below us. Isn\\'t it dreadful? We had such a nice night together,\\nand Mrs. \\'Possum was so sweet and loving in caring for her little ones\\nand feeding them! And, just as we were nearly home again, the dogs\\nsprang upon my friend and the men shot her dead. We had not even\\nsuspected, until then, that our foes were in the forest.\"\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins craned their necks over the edge of the nest and\\nlooked down. On the ground stood a man and a boy, and two great dogs\\nwere growling fiercely and tearing some bloody, revolting object with\\ntheir cruel jaws.\\n\\n\"Look out!\" cried the voice of Wisk, the squirrel. \"He\\'s aiming at\\nyou--look out!\"\\n\\nThey ducked their heads again, just as the gun roared and flamed fire\\nbeneath them.\\n\\n\"Oh-h-h!\" wailed Mrs. Hootaway, fluttering violently beside them. \"They\\nstruck me that time--the bullet is in my heart. Good-bye, my dears.\\nRemember that--all--is love; all is--love!\"\\n\\nHer voice died away to a whisper, and she toppled from the limb.\\nTwinkle and Chubbins tried to save their dying friend from falling, but\\nthe gray owl was so much bigger than they that they could not support\\nthe weight of her body. Slowly she sank to the ground and fell upon the\\nearth with a dull sound that was dreadful to hear.\\n\\nInstantly Twinkle darted from the nest and swooped downward, alighting\\non the ground beside the owl\\'s quivering body. A big dog came bounding\\ntoward her. The man was reloading his gun, a few paces away.\\n\\n\"Call off your dog!\" shouted Twinkle, wildly excited. \"How dare you\\nshoot the poor, harmless birds? Call off your dog, I say!\"\\n\\nBut, even as she spoke, the words sounded in her own ears strange and\\nunnatural, and more like the chirping of a bird than the language of\\nmen. The hunter either did not hear her or he did not understand her,\\nand the dog snarled and bared its wicked teeth as it sprang greedily\\nupon the child-lark.\\n\\nTwinkle was too terrified to move. She glared upon the approaching\\nmonster helplessly, and it had almost reached her when a black object\\nfell from the skies with the swiftness of a lightning streak and struck\\nthe dog\\'s back, tearing the flesh with its powerful talons and driving\\na stout, merciless beak straight through the skull of the savage brute.\\n\\nThe dog, already dead, straightened out and twitched convulsively. The\\nman shouted angrily and sprang upon the huge bird that had slain his\\npet, at the same time swinging his gun like a club.\\n\\n\"Quick!\" said the eagle to Twinkle, \"mount with me as swiftly as you\\ncan.\"\\n\\nWith the words he rose into the air and Twinkle darted after him, while\\nChubbins, seeing their flight from his nest, joined them just in time\\nto escape a shot from the boy\\'s deadly gun.\\n\\nThe inquisitive squirrel, however, had stuck his head out to see what\\nwas happening, and one of the leaden bullets buried itself in his\\nbreast. Chubbins saw him fall back into his hollow and heard his\\nagonized scream; but he could not stay to help his poor friend. An\\ninstant later he had joined the eagle and Twinkle, and was flying as\\nhard and swift as his wonderful lark wings could carry him up, up into\\nthe blue sky.\\n\\nThe sunshine touched them now, while below the tragic forest still lay\\nburied in gloom.\\n\\n\"We are quite safe here, for I am sure no shot from a gun could reach\\nus,\" said the eagle. \"So let us rest upon our wings for a while. How\\nlucky it was that I happened to be around in time to rescue you, my\\nlittle friends.\"\\n\\n\"I am very grateful, indeed,\" answered Twinkle, holding her wings\\noutstretched so that she floated lightly in the air beside her rescuer.\\n\"If you had been an instant later, the dog would have killed me.\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" returned the eagle. \"I saw your danger while I was in the\\nair, and determined to act quickly, although I might myself have been\\nshot by the man had his gun been loaded. But I have noticed that a bold\\naction is often successful because it causes surprise, and the foe does\\nnot know what to do.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m \\'shamed of those people,\" said Chubbins, indignantly. \"What right\\nhad they to come to the forest and kill the pretty owl, and the dear\\nlittle squirrel, and the poor mama \\'possum and her babies?\"\\n\\n\"They had the right of power,\" said the eagle, calmly. \"It would be a\\nbeautiful world were there no destroyers of life in it; but the earth\\nand air and water would then soon become so crowded that there would\\nnot be room for them all to exist. Don\\'t blame the men.\"\\n\\n\"But they are cruel,\" said Twinkle, \"and kill innocent, harmless birds\\nand animals, instead of the wicked ones that could be better spared.\"\\n\\n\"Cruelty is man\\'s nature,\" answered the eagle. \"Of all created things,\\nmen, tigers and snakes are known to be the most cruel. From them we\\nexpect no mercy. But now, what shall be our next movement? I suppose it\\nwill be best for you to keep away from the forest until the men are\\ngone. Would you like to visit my home, and meet my wife and children?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed!\" cried Twinkle; \"if you will be kind enough to let us.\"\\n\\n\"It will be a great pleasure to me,\" said the eagle. \"Follow me\\nclosely, please.\"\\n\\nHe began flying again, and they kept at his side. By and by they\\nnoticed a bright, rosy glow coming from a portion of the forest beneath\\nthem.\\n\\n\"What is that?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"It is the place called the Paradise of Birds,\" answered their\\nconductor. \"It is said to be the most beautiful place in all the world,\\nbut no one except the Birds of Paradise are allowed to live there.\\nThose favored birds sometimes enter our part of the forest, but we are\\nnever allowed to enter theirs.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see that place,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Well, you two child-larks are different from all other birds,\"\\nremarked the eagle, \"and for that reason perhaps you would be allowed\\nto visit the paradise that is forbidden the rest of us. If ever I meet\\none of the beautiful birds that live there, I will ask it to grant you\\nthe privilege.\"\\n\\n\"Do!\" said Twinkle and Chubbins, in one eager breath. They flew for a\\nlong time, high in the air, but neither of the bird-children seemed to\\ntire in the least. They could not go quite as fast as the eagle,\\nhowever, who moderated his speed so that they could keep up with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER X] _In the Eagle\\'s Nest_\\n\\nGradually the forest passed out of sight and only bleak, rugged\\nmountains were below them. One peak rose higher than the others, and\\nfaced the sea, and to this point the great eagle directed their flight.\\n\\nOn a crag that jutted out from the mountain was the eagle\\'s nest, made\\nof rude sticks of wood gathered from the forest. Sitting beside the\\nnest was Mrs. Eagle, larger and more pompous even than her husband,\\nwhile squatting upon the edge of the nest were two half-grown eaglets\\nwith enormous claws and heads, but rather skinny bodies that were\\ncovered with loose and ragged feathers. Neither the nest nor the\\neaglets appeared to be very clean, and a disagreeable smell hung over\\nthe place.\\n\\n\"This is funny,\" said Mrs. Eagle, looking at the child-larks with\\nsurprise. \"Usually you kill your game before you bring it home,\\nJonathan; but today it seems our dinner has flown to us willingly.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re for us!\" cried one of the eaglets, making a quick dash to\\nseize Twinkle, who darted out of his reach.\\n\\n\"One for each of us!\" screamed the other eaglet, rushing at Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Peace--be quiet!\" said the eagle, sternly. \"Cannot you tell friends\\nfrom food, you foolish youngsters? These are two little friends of mine\\nwhom I have invited to visit us; so you must treat them in a civil\\nmanner.\"\\n\\n\"Why not eat them?\" asked one of the eaglets, looking at the\\nchild-larks with hungry eyes.\\n\\n\"Because I forbid you. They are my guests, and must be protected and\\nwell treated. And even if this were not so, the larks are too small to\\nsatisfy your hunger, you little gluttons.\"\\n\\n\"Jonathan,\" said Mrs. Eagle, coldly, \"do not reproach our offspring for\\ntheir hunger. We sent you out this morning to procure a supply of food,\\nand we expected you to bring us home something good to eat, instead of\\nthese useless little creatures.\"\\n\\nThe eagle seemed annoyed at being scolded in this manner.\\n\\n\"I had an adventure in the forest,\" he said, \"and came near being shot\\nand killed by a man. That is the reason I came home so soon.\"\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins were standing together at the edge of the crag\\nwhen one of the eaglets suddenly spread out his wide, stiff wings and\\npushed them over the precipice. They recovered themselves before they\\nhad fallen far, and flew to the ledge again just in time to see the\\nfather eagle cuff his naughty son very soundly. But the mother only\\nlaughed in her harsh voice and said:\\n\\n\"It is so early in the day, Jonathan, that I advise you to go again in\\nsearch of food. Our sweet darlings will not be comforted until they\\nhave eaten.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" answered the eagle. \"I am sorry you cannot treat my guests\\nmore politely, for they are all unaccustomed to such rudeness. But I\\nsee that it will be better for me to take them away with me at once.\"\\n\\n\"Do,\" said Mrs. Eagle; and the eaglets cried: \"Better let us eat \\'em,\\ndaddy. They are not very big, but they\\'re better than no breakfast at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re dis\\'greeable things!\" said Twinkle, indignantly; \"and I don\\'t\\nlike you a bit. So _there!\"_\\n\\n\"Come on, Twink,\" said Chubbins. \"Let\\'s go away.\"\\n\\n\"I will take you back to the forest,\" the eagle declared, and at once\\nrose into the air. Twinkle and Chubbins followed him, and soon the nest\\non the crag was left far behind and they could no longer hear the hoot\\nof the savage young ones.\\n\\nFor a time the eagle flew in silence. Then he said:\\n\\n\"You must forgive my family for not being more hospitable. You must\\nknow that they live a very lonely life, and have no society because\\nevery living thing fears them. But I go abroad more and see more of the\\nworld, so I know very well how guests ought to be treated.\"\\n\\n\"You have been very kind to us, Mr. Eagle,\" replied the girl-lark, \"and\\nyou saved my life when the dog would have killed me. I don\\'t blame you\\nany for what your family did. My mama says lots of people show off\\nbetter abroad than they do at home, and that\\'s your case exactly. If I\\nwere you I wouldn\\'t take any more visitors to my nest.\"\\n\\n\"I do not intend to,\" answered the eagle. \"But I am glad that you think\\nwell of me personally, if you do not of my family, and I assure you it\\nhas been a real pleasure to me to assist you. Were you like ordinary\\nbirds, you would be beneath my notice; but I am wise enough to\\nunderstand that you are very unusual and wonderful little creatures,\\nand if at any time I can serve you further, you have but to call me,\\nand I will do what I can for you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you very much,\" replied Twinkle, who realized that the great\\nbird had acted more gently toward them than it is the nature of his\\nwild race to do.\\n\\nThey had just reached the edge of the forest again when they saw a bird\\napproaching them at a great speed, and soon it came near enough for\\nthem to see that it was Policeman Bluejay. He wore his official helmet\\nand carried his club, and as soon as he came beside them he said:\\n\\n\"Thank goodness I\\'ve found you at last. I\\'ve been hunting for you an\\nhour, and began to fear you had met with some misfortune.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been with the eagle,\" said the girl. \"He saved our lives and\\ncarried us away from where the dreadful men were.\"\\n\\n\"We have had sad doings in the forest today--very sad, indeed,\"\\ndeclared the bluejay, in a grave voice. \"The hunters did even more\\ndamage than usual. They killed Jolly Joe, the brown bear, and Sam Fox,\\nand Mrs. \\'Possum and her babies, and Wisk the squirrel; so that the\\nanimals are all in mourning for their friends. But our birds suffered\\ngreatly, also. Mrs. Hootaway is dead, and three pigeons belonging to a\\nhighly respected family; but the saddest of all is the murder of Mr.\\nand Mrs. Goldfinch, both of whom were killed by the same shot. You may\\nremember, my dears, that they were at your reception yesterday, and as\\ngay and happy as any of the company present. In their nest are now five\\nlittle children, too young and weak to fly, and there is no one to feed\\nthem or look after them.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that is dreadful!\" exclaimed Twinkle. \"Can\\'t Chubbins and I do\\nsomething for the little goldfinches?\"\\n\\n\"Why, that is why I was so anxious to find you,\" answered Policeman\\nBluejay. \"You haven\\'t laid any eggs yet, and have no one to depend upon\\nyou. So I hoped you would adopt the goldfinch babies.\"\\n\\n\"We will,\" said Chubbins, promptly. \"We can feed them out of our\\nbasket.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes,\" chimed in the girl. \"We couldn\\'t catch grubs for them, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be necessary,\" observed the policeman, with a sly wink at the\\neagle. \"They\\'re too young yet to know grubs from grub.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XI] _The Orphans_\\n\\nThe eagle now bade them good-bye and flew away in search of prey, while\\nthe bluejay and the child-larks directed their flight toward that part\\nof the great forest where they lived.\\n\\n\"Are you sure the men have gone?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the policeman; \"they left the forest as soon as they had\\nshot Jolly Joe, for the brown bear was so heavy that they had to carry\\nhim on a pole resting across their shoulders. I hope they won\\'t come\\nagain very soon.\"\\n\\n\"Did they take Mrs. Hootaway with them?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Yes; she will probably be stuffed, poor thing!\"\\n\\nPresently they passed near the rosy glow that lighted up the center of\\nthe forest with its soft radiance, and the girl said:\\n\\n\"That is the Paradise Land, where the Birds of Paradise live. The eagle\\nhas promised to ask one of those birds to let us visit their country.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I can do better than that, if you wish to visit the Paradise,\"\\nresponded the bluejay; \"for the Guardian of the Entrance is a special\\nfriend of mine, and will do whatever I ask him to.\"\\n\\n\"Will he, really?\" asked the girl, in delight.\\n\\n\"To be sure. Some day I will take you over there, and then you will see\\nwhat powerful friends Policeman Bluejay has.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like that,\" declared Twinkle.\\n\\nTheir swift flight enabled them to cover the remaining distance very\\nrapidly, and soon they were at home again.\\n\\nThey first flew to the nest of the goldfinches, which was in a tree not\\nfar from the maple where the lark-children lived. There they found the\\ntiny birds, who were yet so new that they were helpless indeed. Mrs.\\nRedbreast was sitting by the nest when they arrived, and she said:\\n\\n\"The poor orphans are still hungry, although I have fed them all the\\ninsects I could find near. But I am glad that you have come, for it is\\ntime I was at home looking after my own little ones.\"\\n\\n\"Chubbins and I have \\'dopted the goldfinches,\" said Twinkle, \"so we will\\nlook after them now. But it was very nice of you, Mrs. Redbreast, to\\ntake take care of them until we arrived.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I like to be neighborly,\" returned the pretty bird; \"and as long\\nas cruel men enter our forest no mother can tell how soon her own\\nlittle ones will be orphaned and left helpless.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" said the policeman, nodding gravely.\\n\\nSo Mrs. Redbreast flew away and now Chubbins looked curiously into the\\nnest, where several fluffy heads were eagerly lifted with their bills\\nas wide open as they could possibly stretch.\\n\\n\"They must be just _awful_ hungry, Twink,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"Oh, they\\'re always like that,\" observed Policeman Bluejay, calmly.\\n\"When anyone is around they open their mouths to be fed, whether they\\nare hungry or not. It\\'s the way with birdlets.\"\\n\\n\"What shall we feed them?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Oh, anything at all; they are not particular,\" said the bluejay, and\\nthen he flew away and left the child-larks to their new and interesting\\ntask.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be the father, and you be the mother,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"All right,\" answered Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Peep! peep! peep!\" said the tiny goldfinches.\\n\\n\"I wonder if the luncheon in our basket would agree with them,\"\\nremarked the girl, looking at the open mouths reflectively as she\\nperched her own brown body upon the edge of the deep nest.\\n\\n\"Might try it,\" suggested the boy. \"The cop says they\\'re not\\nparticular, and what\\'s good enough for us ought to be good enough for\\nthem.\"\\n\\nSo they flew to where the basket hung among the thick leaves of the\\ntree, which had served to prevent the men from discovering it, and\\ncrept underneath the cloth that covered it.\\n\\n\"Which do you think they\\'d like best,\" asked Chubbins, \"the pickles or\\nthe cheese?\"\\n\\n\"Neither one,\" Twinkle replied. \"The sandwiches will be best for them.\\nWait; I\\'ll pick out some of the meat that is between the slices of\\nbread. They\\'ll be sure to like that.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" agreed Chubbins, promptly. \"They\\'ll think it\\'s bugs.\"\\n\\nSo each one dragged out a big piece of meat from a sandwich, and by\\nholding it fast in one claw they managed to fly with the burden to the\\nnest of the goldfinch babies.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t give it to \\'em all at once,\" cautioned the girl. \"It would choke\\n\\'em.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\nHe tore off a tiny bit of the meat and dropped it into one of the\\nwide-open bills. Instantly it was gone and the mouth was open again for\\nmore. They tried to divide the dinner equally among them, but they all\\nlooked so alike and were so ravenous to eat everything that was dropped\\ninto their bills that it was hard work to keep track of which had been\\nfed and which had not. But the child-larks were positive that each one\\nhad had enough to keep it from starving, because there was a big bunch\\nin front of each little breast that was a certain proof of a full crop.\\n\\nThe next task of the guardians was to give the birdlets drink; so\\nTwinkle and Chubbins flew to the brook and by hunting around a while\\nthey found an acorn-cup that had fallen from one of the oak trees. This\\nthey filled with water, and then Twinkle, who was a trifle larger than\\nthe boy-lark, clutched the cup firmly with her toes and flew back to\\nthe orphans without spilling more than a few drops. They managed to\\npour some of the water into each open mouth, and then Twinkle said:\\n\\n\"There! they won\\'t die of either hunger or thirst in a hurry, Chub. So\\nnow we can feed ourselves.\"\\n\\n\"Their mouths are still open,\" returned the boy, doubtfully.\\n\\n\"It must be a habit they have,\" she answered. \"Wouldn\\'t you think\\nthey\\'d get tired stretching their bills that way?\"\\n\\n\"Peep! peep! peep!\" cried the baby goldfinches.\\n\\n\"You see,\" said the boy, with a wise look, \"they don\\'t know any better.\\nI had a dog once that howled every time we shut him up. But if we let\\nhim alone he stopped howling. We\\'ll go and get something to eat and let\\nthese beggars alone a while. Perhaps they\\'ll shut their mouths by the\\ntime we get back again.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" replied Twinkle.\\n\\nThey got their own luncheon from the basket, and afterward perched on\\nthe tree near the nest of the little goldfinches. They did not feel at\\nall comfortable in their old nest in the maple, because they could not\\nforget the tragic deaths of the inhabitants of the three hollows in the\\ntree--the three \"flats\" as poor Wisk had merrily called them.\\n\\nDuring the afternoon several of the birds came to call upon the\\norphans, and they all nodded approval when they found the child-larks\\nwatching over the little ones. Twinkle questioned some of the mothers\\nanxiously about that trick the babies had of keeping their bills open\\nand crying for food, but she was told to pay no attention to such\\nactions.\\n\\nNevertheless, the pleadings of the orphans, who were really stuffed\\nfull of food, made the child-larks so nervous that they hailed with\\ndelight the arrival of Policeman Bluejay in the early evening. The busy\\nofficer had brought with him Mrs. Chaffinch, a widow whose husband had\\nbeen killed a few days before by a savage wildcat.\\n\\nMrs. Chaffinch declared she would be delighted to become a mother to\\nthe little goldfinches, and rear them properly. She had always had good\\nsuccess in bringing up her own children, she claimed, and the\\ngoldfinches were first cousins to the chaffinches, so she was sure to\\nunderstand their ways perfectly.\\n\\nTwinkle did not want to give up her charges at first, as she had become\\ninterested in them; but Chubbins heaved a sigh of relief and declared\\nhe was glad the \"restless little beggars\" had a mother that knew more\\nabout them than he did. The bluejay hinted that he considered the\\nwidow\\'s experience would enable her to do more for the baby goldfinches\\nthan could a child-lark who had never yet laid an egg, and so Twinkle\\nwas forced to yield to his superior judgment.\\n\\nMrs. Chaffinch settled herself in a motherly manner upon the nest, and\\nthe two bird-children bade her good-night and returned to their own\\nmaple tree, where they had a rather wakeful night, because Chubbins\\nthoughtlessly suggested that the place might be haunted by the ghosts\\nof the gray owl, Wisk, and Mrs. \\'Possum.\\n\\nBut either the poor things had no ghosts or they were too polite to\\nbother the little child-larks.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XII] _The Guardian_\\n\\nThe next morning ushered in a glorious day, sunny and bright. The sky\\nwas a clear blue, and only a slight breeze ruffled the leaves of the\\ntrees. Even before Twinkle and Chubbins were awake the birds were\\ncalling merrily to one another throughout the forest, and the chipmonks\\nchirped in their own brisk, businesslike way as they scuttled from tree\\nto tree.\\n\\nWhile the child-larks were finishing their breakfast Policeman Bluejay\\ncame to them, his feathers looking fresh and glossy and all his\\ngorgeous colorings appearing especially beautiful in the sunshine.\\n\\n\"Today will be a rare day to visit the Paradise,\" he said; \"so I have\\ncome to escort you to the Guardian of the Entrance, who I am sure will\\narrange for you to enter that wonderful country.\"\\n\\n\"It is very kind of you to remember our wish,\" said Twinkle. \"We are\\nall ready.\"\\n\\nSo they flew above the tree-tops and began their journey toward the\\ncenter of the forest.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your p\\'liceman\\'s hat and club?\" Chubbins asked the bluejay.\\n\\n\"Why, I left them at home,\" was the reply. \"I\\'m not on official duty\\ntoday, you know, and the Guardian does not like to see anything that\\nlooks like a weapon. In his country there are no such things as\\nquarrels or fighting, or naughtiness of any sort; for as they have\\neverything they want there is nothing to quarrel over or fight for. The\\nBirds of Paradise have laws, I understand; but they obey them because\\nthey are told to, and not because they are forced to. It would be a bad\\ncountry for a policeman to live in.\"\\n\\n\"But a good place for everyone else,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Perhaps so,\" agreed the policeman, reluctantly. \"But I sometimes think\\nthe goody-goody places would get awful tiresome to live in, after a\\ntime. Here in our part of the forest there is a little excitement, for\\nthe biggest birds only obey our laws through fear of punishment, and I\\nunderstand it is just the same in the world of men. But in the Birds\\'\\nParadise there lives but one race, every member of which is quite\\nparticular not to annoy any of his fellows in any way. That is why they\\nwill admit no disturbing element into their country. If you are\\nadmitted, my dears, you must be very careful not to offend any one that\\nyou meet.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll try to be good,\" promised Chubbins.\\n\\n\"I would not dare to take any of my own people there,\" continued the\\nbluejay, flying swiftly along as they talked together; \"but you two are\\ndifferent, and more like the fairy Birds of Paradise themselves than\\nlike our forest birds. That is the reason I feel sure the Guardian will\\nadmit you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m naughty sometimes, and so is Chubbins,\" said Twinkle, honestly.\\n\"But we try not to be any naughtier than we can help.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure you will behave very nicely,\" replied the bluejay.\\n\\nAfter a time the rosy glow appeared reflected in the blue sky, and as\\nthey flew toward it the soft and delightful radiance seemed to grow and\\ndeepen in intensity. It did not dazzle their eyes in the least, but as\\nthe light penetrated the forest and its furthest rays fell upon the\\ngroup, they experienced a queer sense of elation and light-hearted joy.\\n\\nBut now the breeze freshened and grew more strong, pressing against\\ntheir feathered breasts so gently yet powerfully that they soon\\ndiscovered they were not advancing at all, but simply fluttering in the\\nair.\\n\\n\"Drop down to the ground,\" whispered the bluejay; and they obeyed his\\ninjunction and found that close to the earth the wind was not so\\nstrong.\\n\\n\"That is a secret I learned some time ago,\" said their friend. \"Most\\nbirds who seek to enter the Paradise try to beat against the wind, and\\nare therefore always driven back; but there is just one way to approach\\nthe Guardian near enough to converse with him. After that it depends\\nentirely upon his good-will whether you get any farther.\"\\n\\nThe wind still blew so strongly that it nearly took their breath away,\\nbut by creeping steadily over the ground they were able to proceed\\nslowly, and after a time the pressure of the wind grew less and less,\\nuntil it suddenly ceased altogether.\\n\\nThen they stopped to rest and to catch their breaths, but before this\\nhappened Twinkle and Chubbins both uttered exclamations of amazement at\\nthe sight that met their eyes.\\n\\nBefore them was a grove composed of stately trees not made of wood, but\\nhaving trunks of polished gold and silver and leaves of exquisite\\nmetallic colorings. Beneath the trees was a mass of brilliant flowers,\\nexceedingly rare and curious in form, and as our little friends looked\\nupon them these flowers suddenly began a chant of greeting and then\\nsang a song so sweet and musical that the lark-children were entranced\\nand listened in rapt delight.\\n\\nWhen the song ended the flowers all nodded their heads in a pretty way,\\nand Twinkle drew a long breath and murmured:\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it odd to hear flowers sing? I\\'m sure the birds themselves\\ncannot beat that music.\"\\n\\n\"They won\\'t try,\" replied the policeman, \"for Birds of Paradise do not\\nsing.\"\\n\\n\"How strange!\" exclaimed the girl.\\n\\n\"The land they live in is so full of music that they do not need to,\"\\ncontinued the bluejay. \"But before us is the entrance, leading through\\nthe limbs of that great golden tree you see at the left. Fly swiftly\\nwith me, and perch upon the middle branch.\"\\n\\nWith these words he darted toward the tree, and Twinkle and Chubbins\\nfollowed. In a few seconds they alighted upon the branch and found\\nthemselves face to face with the first Bird of Paradise they had yet\\nseen.\\n\\nHe possessed a graceful carriage and a most attractive form, being in\\nsize about as large as a common pigeon. His eyes were shrewd but gentle\\nin expression and his pose as he stood regarding the newcomers was\\ndignified and impressive. But the children had little time to note\\nthese things because their wondering eyes were riveted upon the bird\\'s\\nmagnificent plumage. The feathers lay so smoothly against his body that\\nthey seemed to present a solid surface, and in color they were a\\nglistening emerald green upon the neck and wings, shading down on the\\nbreast to a softer green and then to a pure white. The main\\nwing-feathers were white, tipped with vivid scarlet, and the white\\nfeathers of his crest were also tipped with specks of flame. But his\\ntail feathers were the most beautiful of all his gay uniform. They\\nspread out in the shape of a fan, and every other feather was brilliant\\ngreen and its alternate feather snow white.\\n\\n\"How lovely!\" cried Twinkle, and the bird bowed its head and with a\\nmerry glance from its eyes responded:\\n\\n\"Your admiration highly honors me, little stranger.\"\\n\\n\"This,\" said Policeman Bluejay, \"is the important official called the\\nGuardian of the Entrance of Paradise. Sir Guardian, permit me to\\nintroduce to you two children of men who have been magically\\ntransformed into skylarks against their will. They are not quite birds,\\nbecause their heads retain the human shape; but whatever form they may\\nbear, their natures are sweet and innocent and I deem them worthy to\\nassociate for a brief time with your splendid and regal race. Therefore\\nI have brought them here to commend them to your hospitality and\\ngood-will, and I hope you will receive them as your guests.\"\\n\\n\"What are your names, little strangers?\" asked the Guardian.\\n\\n\"Mama calls me Twinkle,\" said the girl.\\n\\n\"I\\'m Chubbins,\" said the boy.\\n\\nThe Guardian looked attentively at the bluejay.\\n\\n\"You know our regulations,\" said he; \"no birds of the forest are\\nadmitted to our Paradise.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" replied the policeman. \"I will await my little friends here.\\nIt is pleasure enough for me to have just this glimpse of your\\nbeautiful fairyland.\"\\n\\nThe Guardian nodded his approval of this speech.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" he answered, \"you shall remain and visit with me. If all\\nforest birds were like you, my friend, there would be little danger in\\nadmitting them into our society. But they are not, and the laws must be\\nregarded. As for the child-larks, I will send them first to the King,\\nin charge of the Royal Messenger, whom I will now summon.\"\\n\\nHe tossed his head upward with an abrupt motion, and in the tree-top a\\nchime of golden bells rang musically in the air. The flowers beneath\\nthem caught up the refrain, and sang it softly until another bird came\\ndarting through the air and alighted on the golden limb beside the\\nGuardian.\\n\\nThe newcomer was differently garbed from the other. His plumage was\\norange and white, the crest and wing-feathers being tipped with bright\\nblue. Nor was he so large as the Guardian, nor so dignified in\\ndemeanor. Indeed, his expression was rather merry and roguish, and as\\nhe saw the strangers he gave a short, sharp whistle of surprise.\\n\\n\"My dear Ephel,\" said the Guardian, \"oblige me by escorting these\\nchild-larks to the presence of his Majesty the King.\"\\n\\n\"I am delighted to obey your request,\" answered Ephel the Messenger,\\nbrightly. Then, turning to Twinkle and Chubbins, he added: \"I trust you\\nwill find my society agreeable during our flight to the royal monarch\\nof Paradise.\"\\n\\nTwinkle was too much embarrassed by this politeness to answer at once,\\nbut Chubbins said \"Sure thing!\" in a matter-of-fact voice, and the\\nMessenger nodded gaily and continued:\\n\\n\"Then we will go, if it pleases you.\"\\n\\nHe spread his wings in a flash of color and sped away into the\\nParadise, and the children eagerly followed him.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XIII] _The King Bird_\\n\\nMore and more magnificence was unfolded as they advanced into this\\nveritable fairyland of the birds. Vines of silver climbed up the golden\\ntrunks of trees and mingled their twining threads with the brilliant\\nleaves. And now upon the trees appeared jewelled blossoms that sparkled\\nmost exquisitely in the rosy-hued radiance that, in this favored spot,\\nhad taken the place of sunshine. There were beds of plants with\\nwide-spreading leaves that changed color constantly, one hue slowly\\nmelting into another and no two leaves on the same plant having the\\nsame color at the same time. Yet in spite of the vivid coloring that\\nprevailed everywhere, each combination seemed in perfect harmony and\\nserved to delight the senses.\\n\\nBushes that emitted a grateful fragrance bore upon slender branches\\nlittle bells that at times tinkled in the perfumed breeze and played\\nsweet melodies, while here and there were clusters of fountain-lilies\\nthat shot sprays of crystal water high into the air. When the water\\nfell back again and the drops struck against the broad leaves of the\\nplants, they produced a melodious sound that was so delightful that\\nTwinkle thought she could listen to it for hours.\\n\\nTheir guide flew silently on, and the two children were so much amazed\\nby their surroundings that they had no words for questions or even\\nremarks.\\n\\nThe scene was ever shifting and becoming more and more lovely and\\nfascinating, and the paradise was more extensive than they had thought\\nit.\\n\\nBy and bye Ephel the Messenger approached the central part, where was a\\ngreat arbor thickly covered with masses of pure white flowers. Some of\\nthese were large, like chrysanthemums and mammoth white double roses,\\nwhile among them were twined smaller and more delicate blossoms, like\\nthe bells of lilies-of-the-valley.\\n\\nEphel entered the arch of the arbor and flew on, for it was of great\\nextent and continually enlarged from the point of entrance, so that at\\nlast the child-larks found themselves in a lofty circular chamber\\nbanked on sides and roof with solid masses of the snow-white flowers,\\nwhich filled the air with a sweet and agreeable perfume. The floor was\\nalso a mass of white blossoms, so that the place resembled the inside\\nof a huge cornucopia.\\n\\nBut the eyes of the little strangers were not directed so much to the\\narbor itself as to the group of splendid birds that occupied the\\nflower-chamber and perched upon a wide-spreading bush of filigree gold\\nthat rose from the middle of the floor and spread its dainty branches\\nin every direction.\\n\\nOn the lower branches sat many birds of marvellous colorings, some\\nhaving blue the predominant tint in their feathers, and others green,\\nor scarlet, or brilliant yellows. In strong contrast with these were a\\nfew modest-looking birds with soft brown feathers covering their\\ngraceful forms, that sat silently upon the lowest and most retired\\nbranch of the golden bush; but still greater was the contrast of all\\npresent with the magnificence of the one occupying the topmost branch.\\n\\nThis gorgeous creature, whose splendor dominated the white bower, at\\nonce won the children\\'s attention, and they had no doubt they were\\ngazing upon the King Bird of Paradise.\\n\\nThe feathers of his head and neck were so fine that they looked like a\\ncovering of velvet. These seemed to be, at first, of a delicate\\nlavender color, but the children observed that they shone with a\\ndifferent tint at every movement the King made. The body feathers, also\\nas glossy as velvet, were of a rich royal purple, shading to lavender\\nand then to white upon his breast. His wing plumes were white, tipped\\nwith specks of lustrous gold.\\n\\nBut by far the most astonishing part of the King\\'s plumage was that\\nwhich consisted of the dainty, fern-like plumes that rose from his body\\nand tail and spread in graceful and bewildering curves both right and\\nleft, until his form seemed to be standing in a feathery bower of\\nresplendent beauty. All the colors of the rainbow were seen in these\\ndelicate feathers, and against the white background of the arch this\\nmonarch of the feathered world appeared more royally magnificent than\\nany words can describe.\\n\\nBoth Twinkle and Chubbins gasped with amazement and delight as, at the\\ncommand of Ephel, they alighted upon a lowly branch of the golden bush\\nand bowed their heads before the ruler of the birds\\' fairyland.\\n\\n\"Ah, whom have we here?\" asked the King, in a soft voice, as he\\nstrutted and proudly turned himself upon his perch.\\n\\n\"Strangers, your Majesty,\" answered the Messenger. \"They are sent to\\nyou by the Guardian of the Entrance because they are gentle and\\ninnocent, and are neither birds nor mortals, but a part of both.\"\\n\\n\"They are certainly very curious,\" remarked the King, staring at the\\nhuman heads upon the lark bodies. \"May I ask you, little strangers, how\\nyou happen to exist in your present form?\"\\n\\nTwinkle, tossing her head to throw back a straggling lock of hair that\\nhad fallen across her eyes, began in her sweet voice to tell the story\\nof their enchantment, and not only the King but all the Birds of\\nParadise present listened intently to her words.\\n\\nWhen she had finished the King exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Indeed, my dear child-larks, you are worthy to be our guests in\\nfairyland. So it will please me if you will be as happy and comfortable\\nas possible, and enjoy your stay with us as much as you can. My people\\nwill delight to honor and amuse you, and Ephel shall continue to guide\\nyou wherever you go.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" returned Twinkle, earnestly; and Chubbins added, in his\\nblunt way: \"Much obliged.\"\\n\\n\"But, before you go,\" continued his Majesty, \"tell me what you think of\\nmy royal person. Am I not beautiful?\"\\n\\n\"You are, indeed,\" replied Twinkle; \"only--\"\\n\\n\"Only what?\" asked the King, as she hesitated.\\n\\n\"Only I\\'m sorry you are so vain, and strut around so, and want everyone\\nto see how beautiful you are.\"\\n\\n\"Why should I not? Is not vanity one of the great virtues?\" asked the\\nKing, in a surprised voice.\\n\\n\"My mama says people ought not to think themselves nice, or pretty,\"\\nsaid the child. \"With us, to be vain is a fault, and we are taught to\\nbe modest and unassuming.\"\\n\\n\"How remarkable!\" exclaimed the King. \"And how very thoughtless your\\nmother must be. Here we think that if God creates us beautiful it is a\\nsin not to glory in His work, and make everyone acknowledge the kindly\\nskill of the Supreme Maker\\'s hand. Should I try to make others think,\\nor should I myself think, that I am not most gracefully formed and most\\ngorgeously clothed, I would be guilty of the sin of not appreciating\\nthe favor of God, and deserve to be punished.\"\\n\\nTwinkle was amazed, but could find no words to contradict this\\nastonishing idea.\\n\\n\"I had not thought of it in that way,\" she answered. \"Perhaps I am\\nwrong, your Majesty; and certainly you are very beautiful.\"\\n\\n\"Think it over,\" said the King, graciously. \"Learn to be grateful for\\nevery good thing that is yours, and proud that you have been selected\\nby Nature for adornment. Only in this way may such rare favors be\\ndeserved. And now the royal Messenger will show you the sights of our\\nParadise, and try to entertain you pleasantly while you are our\\nguests.\"\\n\\nHe turned aside, with these words, and fluttered his waving feathers so\\nthat their changing tints might dazzle the eyes of all observers. But\\nimmediately afterward he paused and cried out:\\n\\n\"Dear me! One of my wing plumes is disarranged. Help me, you ladies!\"\\n\\nAt once the small brown birds on the lower branches, who had been\\nmodestly quiet because they had no gay plumage, flew up to the King and\\nwith their bills skillfully dressed his feathers, putting the wing\\nplume into its place again and arranging it properly, while the other\\nbirds looked on with evident interest.\\n\\nAs the lark-children turned away to follow the Messenger Chubbins\\nremarked:\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad _I_ haven\\'t got all those giddy feathers.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" asked Twinkle, who had been rather awed by the King\\'s splendor.\\n\\n\"Because it would take all my time to keep \\'em smooth,\" answered the\\nboy. \"The poor King can\\'t do much more than admire himself, so he don\\'t\\nget time to have fun.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XIV] _A Real Fairyland_\\n\\nAs they left the royal arbor of white flowers the Messenger turned to\\nthe left and guided his guests through several bright and charming\\navenues to a grove of trees that had bright blue bark and yellow\\nleaves. Scattered about among the branches were blossoms of a delicate\\npink color, shaped like a cup and resembling somewhat the flower of the\\nmorning-glory.\\n\\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked Ephel.\\n\\n\"Oh, I could eat something, I guess,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\nThe Messenger flew to one of the trees and alighted upon a branch where\\nthree of the pink, cup-shaped flowers grew in a row. The children\\nfollowed him, and sitting one before each blossom they looked within\\nthe cups and found them filled with an unknown substance that both\\nlooked and smelled delicious and appetizing.\\n\\n\"It is royal amal,\" said their guide, busily pecking at his cup with\\nhis bill. \"Help yourselves, little ones. You will find it very nice\\nindeed.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Twinkle, \"I\\'d be glad to eat it if I could. But it\\nwouldn\\'t do Chubbins and me a bit of good to stick our noses into these\\ncups.\"\\n\\nEphel turned to look at them.\\n\\n\"True,\" he remarked; \"it was very careless of me to forget that you\\nhave no bills. How are you accustomed to eat?\"\\n\\n\"Why, with spoons, and knives and forks,\" said the girl.\\n\\n\"You have but to ask for what you need,\" declared the royal Messenger.\\n\\nTwinkle hesitated, scarcely knowing what to say. At last she spoke\\nboldly: \"I wish Chub and I had spoons.\"\\n\\nHardly had the words left her lips when two tiny golden spoons appeared\\nin the flower-cups. Twinkle seized the spoon before her in one claw and\\ndipped up a portion of the strange food, which resembled charlotte\\nrusse in appearance. When she tasted it she found it delicious; so she\\neagerly ate all that the blossom contained.\\n\\nWhen she looked around for Chubbins she found he was gone. He had\\nemptied his cup and carried the golden spoon to another blossom on a\\nhigher limb, where the girl discovered him eating as fast as he could\\ndip up the food.\\n\\n\"Let us go to another tree,\" said Ephel. \"There are many excellent\\nthings to eat, and a variety of food is much more agreeable than\\nfeasting upon one kind.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" called Chubbins, who had succeeded in emptying the second\\ncup.\\n\\nAs they flew on Twinkle said to the guide:\\n\\n\"I should think the blossoms would all be emptied in a little while.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they fill up again in a few moments,\" replied Ephel. \"Should we go\\nback even now, I think we would find them all ready to eat again. But\\nhere are the conona bushes. Let us taste these favorite morsels.\"\\n\\nThe bushes on which they now rested had willow-green branches with\\nsilver balls growing thickly upon them. Ephel tapped lightly upon one\\nof the balls with his bill and at once it opened by means of a hinge in\\nthe center, the two halves of the ball lying flat, like plates. On one\\nside Twinkle found tiny round pellets of cake, each one just big enough\\nto make a mouthful for a bird. On the other side was a thick substance\\nthat looked like jelly.\\n\\n\"The proper thing to do,\" said their guide, \"is to roll one of the\\npellets in the jelly, and then eat it.\"\\n\\nHe showed Twinkle how to do this, and as she had brought her golden\\nspoon with her it was easy enough. Ephel opened a ball for Chubbins and\\nthen one for himself, and the children thought this food even nicer\\nthan the first they had eaten.\\n\\n\"Now we will have some fruit,\" declared the Messenger. He escorted his\\ncharges to an orchard where grew many strange and beautiful trees\\nhanging full of fruits that were all unknown to the lark-children. They\\nwere of many odd shapes and all superbly colored, some gleaming like\\nsilver and gold and others being cherry-red or vivid blue or royal\\npurple in shade. A few resembled grapes and peaches and cherries; but\\nthey had flavors not only varied and delicious but altogether different\\nfrom the fruits that grow outside of the Birds\\' Paradise.\\n\\nAnother queer thing was, that as fast as the children ate one fruit,\\nanother appeared in its place, and they hopped from branch to branch\\nand tree to tree, trying this one and that, until Chubbins exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Really, Twink, I can\\'t eat another mouthful.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid we\\'ve both been stuffing ourselves, Chub,\" the girl\\nreplied. \"But these things taste so good it is hard to stop at the\\nright time.\"\\n\\n\"Would you like to drink?\" asked Ephel.\\n\\n\"If you please,\" Twinkle answered.\\n\\n\"Then follow me,\" said the guide.\\n\\nHe led them through lovely vistas of wonderful trees, down beautiful\\nwinding avenues that excited their admiration, and past clusters of\\nflowering plants with leaves as big as umbrellas and as bright as a\\npainter\\'s palette. The Paradise seemed to have been laid out according\\nto one exquisite, symmetrical plan, and although the avenues or paths\\nbetween the trees and plants led in every direction, the ground beneath\\nthem was everywhere thickly covered with a carpet of magnificent\\nflowers or richly tinted ferns and grasses. This was because the birds\\nnever walked upon the ground, but always flew through the air.\\n\\nOften, as they passed by, the flowers would greet them with sweet songs\\nor choruses and the plants would play delightful music by rubbing or\\nstriking their leaves against one another, so that the children\\'s ears\\nwere constantly filled with harmony, while their eyes were feasted on\\nthe bewildering masses of rich color, and each breath they drew was\\nfragrant with the delicious odors of the blossoms that abounded on\\nevery side.\\n\\n\"Of all the fairylands I\\'ve ever heard of or read about,\" said Twinkle,\\n\"this certainly is the best.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s just a peach of a fairyland,\" commented Chubbins, approvingly.\\n\\n\"Here is the nectar tree,\" presently remarked the royal Messenger, and\\nhe paused to allow them to observe it.\\n\\nThe tree was all of silver--silver trunk and branches and leaves--and\\nfrom the end of each leaf or branch dripped sparkling drops of a\\npink-tinted liquid. These glistened brightly as they fell through the\\nair and lost themselves in a bed of silver moss that covered all the\\nground beneath the tree.\\n\\nEphel flew to a branch and held his mouth open so that a drop from\\nabove fell into it. Twinkle and Chubbins followed his example, and\\nfound the pink liquid very delightful to drink. It seemed to quench\\ntheir thirst and refresh them at the same time, and when they flew from\\nthe queer dripping tree they were as light-hearted and gay as any two\\nchildren so highly favored could possibly have felt.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you any water in your paradise?\" asked the little girl-lark.\\n\\n\"Yes, of course,\" Ephel answered. \"The fountain-lilies supply what\\nwater we wish to drink, and the Lustrous Lake is large enough for us\\nall to bathe in. Besides these, we have also the Lake of Dry Water, for\\nyou must know that the Lustrous Lake is composed of wet water.\"\\n\\n\"I thought all water was wet,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"It may be so in your country,\" replied the Royal Messenger, \"but in\\nour Paradise we have both dry and wet water. Would you like to visit\\nthese lakes?\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XV] _The Lake of Dry Water_\\n\\nThey flew through the jewelled gardens for quite a way, emerging at\\nlast from among the trees to find before them a pretty sheet of water\\nof a greenish hue. Upon the shore were rushes that when swayed by the\\nbreeze sang soft strains of music.\\n\\n\"This,\" announced their guide, \"is the Lake of Dry Water.\"\\n\\n\"It _looks_ wet, all right,\" said Chubbins, in a tone of doubt.\\n\\n\"But it isn\\'t,\" declared Ephel. \"Watch me, if you please.\"\\n\\nHe hovered over the lake a moment and then dove downward and\\ndisappeared beneath the surface. When he came up again he shook the\\ndrops of water from his plumage and then flew back to rejoin his\\nguests.\\n\\n\"Look at me,\" he said. \"My feathers are not even damp.\" They looked,\\nand saw that he spoke truly. Then Chubbins decided to try a bath in the\\ndry water, and also plunged into the lake. When he came to the surface\\nhe floated there for a time, and ducked his head again and again; but\\nwhen he came back to the others not a hair of his head nor a feather of\\nhis little brown body was in the least moist.\\n\\n\"That\\'s fine water,\" said the boy-lark. \"I suppose you Birds of\\nParadise bathe here all the time.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered Ephel; \"for only wet water is cleansing and refreshing.\\nWe always take our daily baths in the Lustrous Lake. But here we\\nusually sail and disport ourselves, for it is a comfort not to get wet\\nwhen you want to play in the water.\"\\n\\n\"How do you sail?\" asked Twinkle, with interest.\\n\\n\"I will show you,\" replied their guide.\\n\\nHe flew to a tall tree near, that had broad, curling leaves, and\\nplucked a leaf with his bill. The breeze caught it at once and wafted\\nit to the lake, so that it fell gently upon the water.\\n\\n\"Get aboard, please,\" called Ephel, and alighted upon the broad surface\\nof the floating leaf. Twinkle and Chubbins followed, one sitting in\\nfront of their guide and one behind him. Then Ephel spread out his\\nwings of white and orange, and the breeze pushed gently against them\\nand sent the queer boat gliding over the surface of the dry water.\\n\\n\"Sometimes, when the wind is strong,\" said the Royal Messenger, \"these\\nfrail craft upset, and then we are dumped into the water. But we never\\nmind that, because the water is dry and we are not obliged to dress our\\nfeathers again.\"\\n\\n\"It is very convenient,\" observed Twinkle, who was enjoying the sail.\\n\"Could one be drowned in this lake?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose an animal, like man, could, for it is as impossible to\\nbreathe beneath dry water as it is beneath wet. But only birds live\\nhere, and they cannot drown, because as soon as they come to the\\nsurface they fly into the air.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Twinkle, musingly.\\n\\nThey sailed way across the lake, and because the wind was gentle they\\ndid not upset once. On reaching the farther shore they abandoned the\\nleaf-boat and again took wing and resumed their flight through the\\navenues.\\n\\nThere was a great variety of scenery in the Paradise, and wherever they\\nwent something new and different was sure to meet their view.\\n\\nAt one place the avenue was carpeted with big pansies of every color\\none could imagine, some of them, indeed, having several colors blended\\ntogether upon their petals. As they passed over the pansies Twinkle\\nheard a chorus of joyous laughter, and looking downward, she perceived\\nthat the pansies all had faces, and the faces resembled those of happy\\nchildren.\\n\\n\"Wait a minute,\" she cried to Chubbins and the guide, and then she flew\\ndownward until she could see the faces more plainly. They smiled and\\nnodded to the girl-lark, and laughed their merry laughter; but when she\\nspoke to them Twinkle found they were unable to answer a single word.\\n\\nMany of the faces were exceedingly beautiful; but others were bold and\\nsaucy, and a few looked at her with eyes twinkling with mischief. They\\nseemed very gay and contented in their paradise, so Twinkle merely\\nkissed one lovely face that smiled upon her and then flew away to rejoin\\nher companions.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XVI] _The Beauty Dance_\\n\\nBefore long they came to another and larger sheet of water, and this\\nTwinkle decided was the most beautiful lake she had ever seen. Its\\nwaters were mostly deep blue in color, although they had a changeable\\neffect and constantly shifted from one hue to another. Little waves\\nrippled all over its surface, and the edges of the waves were\\nglistening jewels which, as they scattered in spray and fell into the\\nbosom of the lake, glinted and sparkled with a thousand flashing\\nlights. Here were no rushes upon the shore, but instead of them banks\\nof gorgeous flowers grew far down to the water\\'s edge, so that the last\\nones dipped their petals into the lake itself.\\n\\nNestling upon this bank of flowers the Royal Messenger turned to his\\ncompanions and said:\\n\\n\"Here let us rest for a time, while I call the friendly fishes to\\nentertain you.\"\\n\\nHe ended his speech with a peculiar warble, and at its sound a score of\\nfishes thrust their heads above the surface of the water. Some of them\\nwere gold-fish and some silver-fish, but others had opal tints that\\nwere very pretty. Their faces were jolly in expression and their eyes,\\nChubbins thought, must be diamonds, because they sparkled so brightly.\\n\\nSwimming softly here and there in the lovely waters of the Lustrous\\nLake, the fishes sang this song:\\n\\n  \"We are the fishes of the lake;\\n  Our lives are very deep;\\n  We\\'re always active when awake\\n  And quiet when asleep.\\n\\n  \"We get our fins from Finland,\\n  From books we get out tales;\\n  Our eyes they come from Eyerland\\n  And weighty are our scales.\\n\\n  \"We love to flop and twist and turn\\n  Whenever \\'tis our whim.\\n  Yet social etiquette we learn\\n  Because we\\'re in the swim.\\n\\n  \"Our beds, though damp, are always made;\\n  We need no fires to warm us;\\n  When we swim out we\\'re not afraid,\\n  For autos cannot harm us.\\n\\n  \"We\\'re independent little fish\\n  And never use umbrellas.\\n  We do exactly as we wish\\n  And live like jolly fellows.\"\\n\\nAs the fishes concluded their song they leaped high into the air and\\nthen plunged under the water and disappeared, and it was hard to tell\\nwhich sparkled most brilliantly, their gold and silver bodies or the\\nspray of jewels they scattered about them as they leaped.\\n\\n\"If you should dive into this lake,\" said Ephel the Messenger, \"your\\nfeathers would be dripping wet when you came out again. It is here we\\nBirds of Paradise bathe each morning, after which we visit the Gleaming\\nGlade to perform our Beauty Dance.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see that glade,\" said Twinkle, who was determined to\\nlet nothing escape her that she could possibly see.\\n\\n\"You shall,\" answered Ephel, promptly. \"We will fly there at once.\"\\n\\nSo he led the way and presently they entered a thicker grove of trees\\nthan any they had before noticed. The trunks were so close together\\nthat the birds could only pass between then in single file, but as they\\nproceeded in this fashion it was not long before they came to a\\ncircular space which the child-lark knew at once must be the Gleaming\\nGlade.\\n\\nThe floor was of polished gold, and so bright that as they stood upon\\nit they saw their forms reflected as in a mirror. The trees surrounding\\nthem were also of gold, being beautifully engraved with many attractive\\ndesigns and set with rows of brilliant diamonds. The leaves of the\\ntrees, however, were of burnished silver, and bore so high a gloss that\\neach one served as a looking-glass, reproducing the images of those\\nstanding in the glade thousands of times, whichever way they chanced to\\nturn.\\n\\nThe gleam of these mirror-like leaves was exceedingly brilliant, but\\nEphel said this radiance was much stronger in the morning, when the\\nrosy glow of the atmosphere was not so powerful.\\n\\n\"Then,\" said he, \"the King Bird and all the Nobility of Paradise, who\\nrejoice in the most brilliant plumage, come here from their bath and\\ndance upon the golden floor the Beauty Dance, which keeps their blood\\nwarm until the feathers have all dried. While they dance they can\\nadmire their reflections in the mirrors, which adds greatly to their\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t they have music to dance by?\" asked Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" the Messenger replied. \"There is a regular orchestra that\\nplays exquisite music for the dance; but the musicians are the female\\nBirds of Paradise, who, because their plumage is a modest brown, are\\nnot allowed to take part in the Beauty Dance.\"\\n\\n\"I think the brown birds with the soft gray breasts are just as pretty\\nas the gaily clothed ones,\" said Twinkle. \"The male birds are too\\nbright, and tire my eyes.\"\\n\\nEphel did not like this speech, for he was very proud of his own\\ngorgeous coloring; but he was too polite to argue with his guest, so he\\nlet the remark pass.\\n\\n\"You have now witnessed the most attractive scenes in our favored\\nland,\" he said; \"but there are some curious sights in the suburbs that\\nmight serve to interest you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! have you suburbs, too?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed. We do not like to come into too close contact with the\\ncoarse, outer world, so we have placed the flying things that are not\\nbirds midway between our Paradise and the great forest. They serve us\\nwhen we need them, and are under our laws and regulations; but they are\\nso highly favored by being permitted to occupy the outer edge of our\\nglorious Paradise that they willingly obey their masters. After all,\\nthey live happy lives, and their habits, as I have said, may amuse you.\\n\\n\"Who are they?\" enquired Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Come with me, and you shall see for yourselves.\"\\n\\nThey flew away from the grove of the Gleaming Glade and Ephel led them\\nby pleasant routes into a large garden with many pretty flowers in it.\\nMostly it was filled with hollyhocks--yellow, white, scarlet and\\npurple.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XVII] _The Queen Bee_\\n\\nAs they approached they heard a low, humming sound, which grew louder\\nas they advanced and aroused their curiosity.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked Twinkle, at last.\\n\\nEphel answered: \"It is the suburb devoted to the bees.\"\\n\\n\"But bees are not birds!\" exclaimed Twinkle.\\n\\n\"No; as I have told you, the suburbs contain flying things that cannot\\nbe called birds, and so are unable to live in our part of the Paradise.\\nBut because they have wings, and love all the flowers and fruits as we\\ndo ourselves, we have taken them under our protection.\"\\n\\nEphel perched upon a low bush, and when the child-larks had settled\\nbeside him he uttered a peculiar, shrill whistle. The humming sound\\ngrew louder, then, and presently hundreds of great bees rose above the\\nflower tops and hovered in the air. But none of them approached the\\nbush except one monstrous bumble-bee that had a body striped with black\\nand gold, and this one sailed slowly toward the visitors and alighted\\ngracefully upon a branch in front of them.\\n\\nThe bee was all bristling with fine hairs and was nearly half as big as\\nTwinkle herself; so the girl shrank back in alarm, and cried:\\n\\n\"Oh-h-h! I\\'m afraid it will sting me!\"\\n\\n\"How ridiculous!\" answered the bee, laughing in a small but merry\\nvoice. \"Our stings are only for our enemies, and we have no enemies in\\nthis Paradise; so we do not use our stingers at all. In fact, I\\'d\\nalmost forgotten I had one, until you spoke.\"\\n\\nThe words were a little mumbled, as if the insect had something in its\\nmouth, but otherwise they were quite easy to understand.\\n\\n\"Permit me to introduce her Majesty the Queen Bee,\" said their guide.\\n\"These, your highness, are some little child-larks who are guests of\\nour King. I have brought them to visit you.\"\\n\\n\"They are very welcome,\" returned the Queen Bee. \"Are you fond of\\nhoney?\" she asked, turning to the children.\\n\\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Chubbins; \"but we\\'ve just eaten, and we\\'re chock\\nfull now.\"\\n\\n\"You see,\" the Queen remarked, \"my people are all as busy as bees\\ngathering the honey from every flower.\"\\n\\n\"What do you do with it?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Oh, we eat part of it, and store up the rest for a rainy day.\"\\n\\n\"Does it ever rain here?\" enquired Chubbins.\\n\\n\"Sometimes, at night, when we are all asleep, so as to refresh and\\nmoisten the flowers, and help them to grow.\"\\n\\n\"But if it rains at night, there can\\'t be any rainy days,\" remarked\\nTwinkle; \"so I can\\'t see the use of saving your honey.\"\\n\\n\"Nor can I,\" responded the Queen, laughing again in her pleasant way.\\n\"Out in the world people usually rob us of our stores, and so keep us\\nbusy getting more. But here there are not even robbers, so that the\\nhoney has been accumulating until we hardly know what to do with it. We\\nhave built a village of honeycombs, and I have just had my people make\\nme a splendid palace of honey. But it is our way to gather the sweet\\nstuff, whether we need it or not, so we have to act according to our\\nnatures. I think of building a mountain of honey next.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see that honey palace,\" said Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Then come with me,\" answered the Queen Bee, \"for it will give me\\npleasure to show it to you.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we go?\" asked the girl-lark, turning to Ephel.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" he returned. \"It is quite a wonderful sight, and may\\ninterest you.\"\\n\\nSo they all flew away, the Queen Bee taking the lead, and passed\\ndirectly over the bed of flowers with its swarm of buzzing, busy bees.\\n\\n\"They remind me of a verse from \\'Father Goose,\\'\" said Twinkle, looking\\ncuriously but half fearfully at the hundreds of big insects.\\n\\n\"What is the verse?\" asked the Queen.\\n\\n\"Why, it goes this way,\" answered the girl:\\n\\n  \"\\'A bumble-bee was buzzing on a yellow hollyhock\\n  When came along a turtle, who at the bee did mock,\\n  Saying \"Prithee, Mr. Bumble, why make that horrid noise?\\n  It\\'s really distracting, and every one annoys.\"\\n\\n  \"\\'\"I\\'m sorry,\" said, quite humble, the busy droning bee,\\n  \"The noise is just my bumble, and natural, you see.\\n  And if I didn\\'t buzz so I\\'m sure that you\\'ll agree\\n  I\\'d only be a big fly, and not a bumble-bee.\"\\'\"\\n\\n\"That is quite true,\" said the bee, \"and describes our case exactly.\\nBut you should know that we are not named \\'bumblebees\\' by rights, but\\n\\'Humble Bees.\\' The latter is our proper name.\"\\n\\n\"But why \\'humble?\\'\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Because we are common, work-a-day people, I suppose, and not very\\naristocratic,\" was the reply. \"I\\'ve never heard why they changed our\\nname to \\'bumble,\\' but since you recited that verse I imagine it is on\\naccount of the noise our wings make.\"\\n\\nThey had now passed over the flower beds and approached a remarkable\\nvillage, where the houses were all formed of golden-yellow honey-combs.\\nThere were many pretty shapes among these houses, and some were large\\nand many stories in height while others were small and had but one\\nstory. Some had spires and minarets reaching up into the air, and all\\nwere laid out into streets just like a real village.\\n\\nBut in the center stood a great honey-comb building with so many gables\\nand roofs and peaks and towers that it was easy to guess it was the\\nQueen Bee\\'s palace, of which she had spoken.\\n\\nThey flew in at a second-story window and found themselves in a big\\nroom with a floor as smooth as glass. Yet it was composed of man\\nsix-sided cells filled with honey, which could be seen through the\\ntransparent covering. The walls and roof were of the same material, and\\nat the end of the room was a throne shaped likewise of the honey cells,\\nlike everything else. On a bench along the wall sat several fat and\\nsleepy-looking bumble-bees, who scarcely woke up when their queen\\nentered.\\n\\n\"Those are the drones,\" she said to her visitors. \"It is useless to\\nchide them for their laziness, because they are too stupid to pay\\nattention to even a good scolding. Don\\'t mind them in any way.\"\\n\\nAfter examining the beautiful throne-room, they visited the sleeping\\nchambers, of which there were many, and afterward the parlors and\\ndining-room and the work-rooms.\\n\\nIn these last were many bees building the six-sided pockets or cells\\nfor storing the honey in, or piling them up in readiness for the return\\nof those who were gathering honey from the flowers.\\n\\n\"We are not really honey-bees,\" remarked the Queen; \"but gathering\\nhoney is our chief business, after all, and we manage to find a lot of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t your houses melt when it rains?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"No, for the comb of the honey is pure wax,\" the Queen Bee replied.\\n\"Water does not melt it at all.\"\\n\\n\"Where do you get all the wax?\" Chubbins enquired.\\n\\n\"From the flowers, of course. It grows on the stamens, and is a fine\\ndust called pollen, until we manufacture it into wax. Each of my bees\\ncarries two sacks, one in front of him, to put the honey in, and one\\nbehind to put the wax in.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s funny,\" said the boy-lark.\\n\\n\"I suppose it may be, to you,\" answered the Queen, \"but to us it is a\\nvery natural thing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XVIII] _Good News_\\n\\nEphel and the children now bade the good-natured Queen Bee good-bye,\\nand thanked her for her kindness. The Messenger led them far away to\\nanother place that he called a \"suburb,\" and as they emerged from a\\nthick cluster of trees into a second flower garden they found the air\\nfilled with a great assemblage of butterflies, they being both large\\nand small in size and colored in almost every conceivable manner.\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins had seen many beautiful butterflies, but never\\nsuch magnificent ones as these, nor so many together at one time. Some\\nof them had wings fully as large as those of the Royal Messenger\\nhimself, even when he spread them to their limit, and the markings of\\nthese big butterfly wings were more exquisite than those found upon the\\ntail-feathers of the proudest peacocks.\\n\\nThe butterflies paid no attention to their visitors, but continued to\\nflutter aimlessly from flower to flower. Chubbins asked one of them a\\nquestion, but got no reply.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t they talk?\" he enquired of Ephel.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the Messenger, \"they all know how to talk, but when they\\nspeak they say nothing that is important. They are brainless, silly\\ncreatures, for the most part, and are only interesting because they are\\nbeautiful to look at. The King likes to watch the flashes of color as\\nthey fly about, and so he permits them to live in this place. They are\\nvery happy here, in their way, for there is no one to chase them or to\\nstick pins through them when they are caught.\"\\n\\nJust then a chime of bells tinkled far away in the distance, and the\\nRoyal Messenger listened intently and then said:\\n\\n\"It is my summons to his Majesty the King. We must return at once to\\nthe palace.\"\\n\\nSo they flew into the air again and proceeded to cross the lovely\\ngardens and pass through the avenues of jewelled trees and the fragrant\\norchards and groves until they came at last to the royal bower of white\\nflowers.\\n\\nThe child-larks entered with their guide and found the gorgeous King\\nBird of Paradise still strutting on his perch on the golden bush and\\nenjoying the admiring glances of his courtiers and the ladies of his\\nfamily. He turned as the children entered and addressed his Messenger,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Ephel, have you shown the strangers all the sights of\\nour lovely land?\"\\n\\n\"Most of them, your Majesty,\" replied Ephel.\\n\\n\"What do you think of us now?\" asked the King, turning his eyes upon\\nthe lark-children.\\n\\n\"It must be the prettiest place in all the world!\" cried Twinkle, with\\nreal enthusiasm.\\n\\nHis Majesty seemed much pleased. \"I am very sorry you cannot live here\\nalways,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not,\" declared Chubbins. \"It\\'s too pretty. I\\'d get tired of it\\nsoon.\"\\n\\n\"He means,\" said Twinkle, hastily, for she feared the blunt remark\\nwould displease the kindly King, \"that he isn\\'t really a bird, but a\\nboy who has been forced to wear a bird\\'s body. And your Majesty is wise\\nenough to understand that the sort of life you lead in your fairy\\nparadise would be very different from the life that boys generally\\nlead.\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" replied the King. \"A boy\\'s life must be a dreadful one.\"\\n\\n\"It suits me, all right,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\nThe King looked at him attentively.\\n\\n\"Would you really prefer to resume your old shape, and cease to be a\\nbird?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, if I could,\" Chubbins replied.\\n\\n\"Then I will tell you how to do it,\" said the King. \"Since you told me\\nyour strange story I have talked with my Royal Necromancer, who knows a\\ngood deal about magic, and especially about that same tuxix who\\nwickedly transformed you in the forest. And the Royal Necromancer tells\\nme that if you can find a tingle-berry, and eat it, you will resume\\nyour natural form again. For it is the one antidote in all the world\\nfor the charm the tuxix worked upon you.\"\\n\\n\"What _is_ a tingle-berry?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously, for this\\ninformation interested her as much as it did Chubbins.\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" said the King, \"for it is a common forest berry, and\\nnever grows in our paradise. But doubtless you will have little trouble\\nin finding the bush of the tingle-berry when you return to the outside\\nworld.\"\\n\\nThe children were both eager to go at once and seek the tingle-berry;\\nbut they could not be so impolite as to run away just then, for the\\nKing announced that he had prepared an entertainment in their honor.\\n\\nSo they sat on a branch of the golden bush beside their friend Ephel,\\nwhile at a nod from the King a flock of the beautiful Birds of Paradise\\nflew into the bower and proceeded to execute a most delightful and\\nbewildering set of aerial evolutions. They flew swiftly in circles,\\nspirals, triangles, and solid squares, and all the time that they\\nperformed sweet music was played by some unseen band. It almost dazzled\\nthe eyes of the child-larks to watch this brilliant flashing of the\\ncolored wings of the birds, but the evolutions only lasted for a few\\nminutes, and then the birds flew out again in regular ranks.\\n\\nThen the little brown lady-birds danced gracefully upon the carpet,\\ntheir dainty feet merely touching the tips of the lovely flowers.\\nAfterward the flowers themselves took part, and sang a delightful\\nchorus, and when this was finished the King said they would now indulge\\nin some refreshment.\\n\\nInstantly a row of bell-shaped blossoms appeared upon the golden bush,\\none for each bird present, and all were filled with a delicious ice\\nthat was as cold and refreshing as if it had just been taken from a\\nfreezer. Twinkle and Chubbins asked for spoons, and received them\\nquickly; but the others all ate the ices with their bills.\\n\\nThe King seemed to enjoy his as much as any one, and Twinkle noticed\\nthat as fast as a blossom was emptied of its contents it disappeared\\nfrom the branch.\\n\\nThe child-larks now thanked the beautiful but vain King very earnestly\\nfor all his kindness to them, and especially for telling them about the\\ntingle-berries; and when all the good-byes had been exchanged Ephel\\nflew with them back to the tree where they had left the Guardian of the\\nEntrance and their faithful comrade, Policeman Bluejay.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XIX] _The Rebels_\\n\\nThey were warmly greeted by the bluejay, who asked:\\n\\n\"Did you enjoy the wonderful Paradise?\"\\n\\n\"Very much, indeed,\" cried Twinkle. \"But we were sorry you could not be\\nwith us.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that,\" returned the policeman, cheerfully. \"I have feasted\\nmy eyes upon all the beauties visible from this tree, and my good\\nfriend the Guardian has talked to me and given me much good advice that\\nwill surely be useful to me in the future. So I have been quite\\ncontented while you were gone.\"\\n\\nThe children now gave their thanks to Ephel for his care of them and\\npolite attention, and the Royal Messenger said he was pleased that the\\nKing had permitted him to serve them. They also thanked the green-robed\\nGuardian of the Entrance, and then, accompanied by Policeman Bluejay,\\nthey quitted the golden tree and began their journey back to the\\nforest.\\n\\nIt was no trouble at all to return. The wind caught their wings and\\nblew against them strongly, so that they had but to sail before the\\nbreeze and speed along until they were deep in the forest again. Then\\nthe wind moderated, and presently died away altogether, so that they\\nwere forced to begin flying in order to continue their journey home.\\n\\nIt was now the middle of the afternoon, and the policeman said:\\n\\n\"I hope all has been quiet and orderly during my absence. There are so\\nmany disturbing elements among the forest birds that I always worry\\nwhen they are left alone for many hours at a time.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure they have behaved themselves,\" returned Twinkle. \"They fear\\nyour power so much that the evil-minded birds do not dare to offend you\\nby being naughty.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" said the policeman. \"They know very well that I will\\nnot stand any nonsense, and will always insist that the laws be\\nobeyed.\"\\n\\nThey were now approaching that part of the forest where they lived, and\\nas the policeman concluded his speech they were surprised to hear a\\ngreat flutter of wings among the trees, and presently a flock of big\\nblack rooks flew toward them.\\n\\nAt the head of the band was a saucy-looking fellow who wore upon his\\nhead a policeman\\'s helmet, and carried under his wing a club.\\n\\nPoliceman Bluejay gave a cry of anger as he saw this, and dashed\\nforward to meet the rooks.\\n\\n\"What does this mean, you rascal?\" he demanded, in a fierce voice.\\n\\n\"Easy there, my fine dandy,\" replied the rook, with a hoarse laugh.\\n\"Don\\'t get saucy, or I\\'ll give you a rap on the head!\"\\n\\nThe rooks behind him shrieked with delight at this impudent speech, and\\nthat made the mock policeman strut more absurdly than ever.\\n\\nThe bluejay was not only astonished at this rebellion but he was\\nterribly angry as well.\\n\\n\"That is my policeman\\'s helmet and club,\" he said sternly. \"Where did\\nyou get them?\"\\n\\n\"At your nest, of course,\" retorted the other. \"We made up our minds\\nthat we have had a miserable bluejay for a policeman long enough; so\\nthe rooks elected me in your place, and I\\'m going to make you birds\\nstand around and obey orders, I can tell you! If you do as I command,\\nyou\\'ll get along all right; if you don\\'t, I\\'ll pound you with your own\\nclub until you obey.\"\\n\\nAgain the rooks screamed in an admiring chorus of delight, and when the\\nbluejay observed their great numbers, and that they were all as large\\nas he was, and some even larger and stronger, he decided not to risk an\\nopen fight with them just then, but to take time to think over what had\\nbest be done.\\n\\n\"I will call the other birds to a meeting,\" he said to the rook, \"and\\nlet them decide between us.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t do any good,\" was the reply. \"We rooks have decided the\\nmatter already. We mean to rule the forest, after this, and if any one,\\nor all of the birds, dare to oppose us, we\\'ll fight until we force them\\nto serve us. Now, then, what do you intend to do about it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll think it over,\" said Policeman Bluejay.\\n\\n\"Oho! oho! He\\'s afraid! He\\'s a coward!\" yelled the rooks; and one of\\nthem added:\\n\\n\"Stand up and fight, if you dare!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll fight your false policeman, or any one of you at a time,\" replied\\nthe bluejay.\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t; you\\'ll fight us all together, or not at all,\" they\\nanswered.\\n\\nThe bluejay knew it would be foolish to do that, so he turned away and\\nwhispered to the lark-children:\\n\\n\"Follow me, and fly as swiftly as you can.\"\\n\\nLike a flash he darted high into the air, with Twinkle and Chubbins\\nright behind him, and before the rooks could recover from their\\nsurprise the three were far away.\\n\\nThen the big black birds gave chase, uttering screams of rage; but they\\ncould not fly so swiftly as the bluejay and the larks, and were soon\\nobliged to abandon the pursuit.\\n\\nWhen at last he knew that they had escaped the rooks, Policeman Bluejay\\nentered the forest again and went among the birds to call them all to a\\nmeeting. They obeyed the summons without delay, and were very indignant\\nwhen they heard of the rebellion of the rooks and the insults that had\\nbeen heaped upon their regularly elected officer. Judge Bullfinch\\narrived with his head bandaged with soft feathers, for he had met the\\nrook policeman and, when he remonstrated, had been severely pounded by\\nthe wicked bird\\'s club.\\n\\n\"But what can we do?\" he asked. \"The rooks are a very powerful tribe,\\nand the magpies and cuckoos and blackbirds are liable to side with\\nthem, if they seem to be stronger than we are.\"\\n\\n\"We might get all our people together and fall upon them in a great\\narmy, and so defeat them,\" suggested an oriole.\\n\\n\"The trouble with that plan,\" decided the judge, \"is that we can only\\ndepend upon the smaller birds. The big birds might desert us, and in\\nthat case we would be badly beaten.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps it will be better to submit to the rooks,\" said a little\\nchickadee, anxiously. \"We are neither warriors nor prizefighters, and\\nif we obey our new rulers they may leave us in peace.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed!\" cried a linnet. \"If we submit to them they will think we\\nare afraid, and will treat us cruelly. I know the nature of these\\nrooks, and believe they can only be kept from wickedness by a power\\nstronger than their own.\"\\n\\n\"Hear me, good friends,\" said the bluejay, who had been silent because\\nhe was seriously thinking; \"I have a plan for subduing these rebels,\\nand it is one that I am sure will succeed. But I must make a long\\njourney to accomplish my purpose. Go now quietly to your nests; but\\nmeet me at the Judgment Tree at daybreak to-morrow morning. Also be\\nsure to ask every friendly bird of the forest to be present, for we\\nmust insist upon preserving our liberty, or else be forever slaves to\\nthese rooks.\"\\n\\nWith these words he rose into the air and sped swiftly upon his errand.\\n\\nThe other birds looked after him earnestly.\\n\\n\"I think it will be well for us to follow his advice,\" said Judge\\nBullfinch, after a pause. \"The bluejay is an able bird, and has had\\nmuch experience. Besides, we have ever found him just and honorable\\nsince the time we made him our policeman, so I feel that we may depend\\nupon him in this emergency.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is all we can do,\" replied a robin; and this remark was so\\ntrue that the birds quietly dispersed and returned to their nests to\\nawait the important meeting the next morning.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XX] _The Battle_\\n\\nTwinkle and Chubbins flew slowly home to their nests in the maple tree,\\npausing to ask every bird they met where tingle-berries grew. But none\\nof them could tell.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry we did not ask Policeman Bluejay,\" said Chubbins.\\n\\n\"I intended to ask him, but we hadn\\'t time,\" replied Twinkle. \"But he\\nwill be back to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder what he\\'s going to do,\" remarked the boy.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know, Chub; but it\\'ll be the right thing, whatever it is. You\\nmay be sure of that.\"\\n\\nThey visited the nest of the baby goldfinches, and found the Widow\\nChaffinch still caring for the orphans in her motherly way. The little\\nones seemed to be as hungry as ever, but the widow assured the\\nlark-children that all five had just been fed.\\n\\n\"Did you ever hear of a tingle-berry?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Yes; it seems to me I have heard of that berry,\" was the reply. \"If I\\nremember rightly my grandmother once told me of the tingle-berries, and\\nwarned me never to eat one. But I am quite certain the things do not\\ngrow in our forest, for I have never seen one that I can recollect.\"\\n\\n\"Where do they grow, then?\" enquired Chubbins.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say exactly where; but if they are not in the forest, they\\nmust grow in the open country.\"\\n\\nThe child-larks now returned to their own nest, and sat snuggled up in\\nit during the evening, talking over the day\\'s experiences and the\\nwonderful things they had seen in the fairy-like Paradise of the Birds.\\nSo much sight-seeing had made them tired, so when it grew dark they\\nfell fast asleep, and did not waken until the sun was peeping over the\\nedge of the trees.\\n\\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the girl, \"we shall be late at the meeting\\nat the Judgment Tree. Let\\'s hurry, Chub.\"\\n\\nThey ate a hasty breakfast from the contents of their basket, and after\\nflying to the brook for a drink and a dip in the cool water they\\nhurried toward the Judgment Tree.\\n\\nThere they found a vast assemblage of birds. They were so numerous,\\nindeed, that Twinkle was surprised to find that so many of them\\ninhabited the forest.\\n\\nBut a still greater surprise was in store for her, for immediately she\\ndiscovered sitting upon the biggest branch of the tree twenty-two\\nbluejays, all in a row. They were large, splendidly plumaged birds,\\nwith keen eyes and sharp bills, and at their head was the children\\'s\\nold friend, the policeman.\\n\\n\"These are my cousins,\" he said to the child-larks, proudly, \"and I\\nhave brought them from another forest, where they live, to assist me. I\\nam not afraid of the foolish rooks now, and in a moment we shall fly\\naway to give them battle.\"\\n\\nThe forest birds were all in a flutter of delight at the prompt arrival\\nof the powerful bluejays, and when the word of command was given they\\nall left the tree and flew swiftly to meet the rooks.\\n\\nFirst came the ranks of the twenty-two bluejays, with the policeman at\\ntheir head. Then followed many magpies and cuckoos, who were too clever\\nto side with the naughty rooks when they saw the powerful birds the\\nbluejay had summoned to his assistance. After these flew the smaller\\nbirds, of all descriptions, and they were so many and at the same time\\nso angry that they were likely to prove stubborn foes in a fight.\\n\\nThis vast army came upon the rooks in an open space in the forest.\\nWithout waiting for any words or explanations from the rebels, the\\nsoldierly bluejays fell upon their enemies instantly, fighting fiercely\\nwith bill and claw, while the other birds fluttered in the rear,\\nawaiting their time to join in the affray.\\n\\nPoliceman Bluejay singled out the rook which had stolen his helmet and\\nclub, and dashed upon him so furiously that the black rebel was amazed,\\nand proved an easy victim to the other\\'s superior powers. He threw down\\nthe club and helmet at once; but the bluejay was not satisfied with\\nthat, and attacked the thief again and again, until the air was full of\\nblack feathers torn from the rook\\'s body.\\n\\nAfter all, the battle did not last long; for the rooks soon screamed\\nfor mercy, and found themselves badly plucked and torn by the time\\ntheir assailants finally decided they had been punished enough.\\n\\nLike all blustering, evil-disposed people, when they found themselves\\nconquered they whined and humbled themselves before the victors and\\ndeclared they would never again rebel against Policeman Bluejay, the\\nregularly appointed guardian of the Law of the Forest. And I am told\\nthat after this day the rooks, who are not rightly forest birds, betook\\nthemselves to the nearest villages and farm houses, and contented\\nthemselves with plaguing mankind, who could not revenge themselves as\\neasily as the birds did.\\n\\nAfter the fight Policeman Bluejay thanked his cousins and sent them\\nhome again, and then the birds all surrounded the policeman and cheered\\nhim gratefully for his cleverness and bravery, so that he was the hero\\nof the hour.\\n\\nJudge Bullfinch tried to make a fine speech, but the birds were too\\nexcited to listen to his words, and he soon found himself without an\\naudience.\\n\\nOf course, Twinkle and Chubbins took no part in the fight, but they had\\nhovered in the background to watch it, and were therefore as proud of\\ntheir friend as any of the forest birds could be.\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XXI] _The Tingle-Berries_\\n\\nWhen the excitement of the morning had subsided and the forest was\\nquiet again, Policeman Bluejay came to the nest of the child-larks,\\nwearing his official helmet and club. You may be sure that one of the\\nfirst things Twinkle asked him was if he knew where tingle-berries\\ngrew.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" he replied, promptly. \"They grow over at the north edge of\\nthe forest, in the open country. But you must never eat them, my dear\\nfriend, because they are very bad for birds.\"\\n\\n\"But the Royal Necromancer of the King Bird of Paradise says the\\ntingle-berries will restore us to our proper forms,\" explained the\\ngirl.\\n\\n\"Oh; did he say that? Then he probably knows,\" said the bluejay, \"and I\\nwill help you to find the berries. We birds always avoid them, for they\\ngive us severe pains in our stomachs.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s bad,\" observed Chubbins, uneasily.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Twinkle, \"I\\'d be willing to have a pain or two, just to be\\nmyself again.\"\\n\\n\"So would I, if it comes to that,\" agreed the boy. \"But I\\'d rather have\\nfound a way to be myself without getting the pain.\"\\n\\n\"There is usually but one thing that will overcome an enchantment,\"\\nremarked the bluejay, seriously; \"and if it is a tingle-berry that will\\ndestroy the charm which the old tuxix put upon you, then nothing else\\nwill answer the same purpose. The Royal Necromancer is very wise, and\\nyou may depend upon what he says. But it is late, at this season, for\\ntingle-berries. They do not grow at all times of the year, and we may\\nnot be able to find any upon the bushes.\"\\n\\n\"Cannot we go at once and find out?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously.\\n\\n\"To be sure. It will grieve me to lose you, my little friends, but I\\nwant to do what will give you the most happiness. Come with me,\\nplease.\"\\n\\nThey flew away through the forest, and by and by came upon the open\\ncountry to the north, leaving all the trees behind them.\\n\\n\"Why, this is the place we entered the forest, that day we got\\n\\'chanted!\" cried Twinkle.\\n\\n\"So it is,\" said Chubbins. \"I believe we could find our way home from\\nhere, Twink.\"\\n\\n\"But we can\\'t go home like we are,\" replied the girl-lark. \"What would\\nour folks say, to find us with birds\\' bodies?\"\\n\\n\"They\\'d yell and run,\" declared the boy.\\n\\n\"Then,\" said she, \"we must find the tingle-berries.\"\\n\\nThe bluejay flew with them to some bushes which he said were the kind\\nthe tingle-berries grew upon, but they were all bare and not a single\\nberry could be found.\\n\\n\"There must be more not far away,\" said the policeman, encouragingly.\\n\"Let us look about us.\"\\n\\nThey found several clumps of the bushes, to be sure; but unfortunately\\nno berries were now growing upon them, and at each failure the children\\ngrew more and more sad and despondent.\\n\\n\"If we have to wait until the bushes bear again,\" Twinkle remarked, \"it\\nwill be nearly a year, and I\\'m sure we can\\'t live in the forest all\\nwinter.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" asked the policeman.\\n\\n\"The food in our basket would all be gone, and then we would starve to\\ndeath,\" was the reply. \"We can\\'t eat bugs and worms, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather die!\" declared Chubbins, mournfully.\\n\\nThe bluejay became very thoughtful.\\n\\n\"If we could find some of the tingle bushes growing near the shade of\\nthe forest,\" he said at last, \"there might still be some berries\\nremaining on them. Out here in the bright sunshine the berries soon\\nwither and drop off and disappear.\"\\n\\n\"Then let us look near the trees,\" suggested Twinkle.\\n\\nThey searched for a long time unsuccessfully. It was growing late, and\\nthey were almost in despair, when a sharp cry from Policeman Bluejay\\ndrew the child-larks to his side.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" enquired the girl, trembling with nervous excitement.\\n\\n\"Why,\" said the policeman, \"here is a bush at last, and on it are\\nexactly two ripe tingle-berries!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[CHAPTER XXII] _The Transformation_\\n\\nThey looked earnestly at the bush, and saw that their friend spoke\\ntruly. Upon a high limb was one plump, red berry, looking much like a\\ncranberry, while lower down grew another but smaller berry, which\\nappeared to be partially withered.\\n\\n\"Good!\" the lark-children cried, joyfully; and the next moment Chubbins\\nadded: \"You eat the big berry, Twink.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" she asked, hesitating.\\n\\n\"It looks as if it had more stomach-ache in it,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of that,\" said she. \"But do you suppose the little\\nberry will be enough for you? One side of it is withered, you see.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t matter,\" returned the boy-lark. \"The Royal Necromancer said\\nto eat one berry. He didn\\'t say a little or a big one, you know, or\\nwhether it should be plump or withered.\"\\n\\n\"That is true,\" said the girl-lark. \"Shall I eat mine now?\"\\n\\n\"The sooner the better,\" Chubbins replied.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t forget me, little friend, when you are a human again,\" said\\nPoliceman Bluejay, sadly.\\n\\n\"I shall never forget you,\" Twinkle answered, \"nor any part of all your\\nkindness to us. We shall be friends forever.\"\\n\\nThat seemed to please the handsome blue bird, and Twinkle was so eager\\nthat she could not wait to say more. She plucked the big, plump berry,\\nput it in her mouth with her little claw, and ate it as soon as\\npossible.\\n\\nIn a moment she said: \"Ouch! Oo-oo-oo!\" But it did not hurt so badly,\\nafter all. Her form quickly changed and grew larger; and while Chubbins\\nand Policeman Bluejay watched her anxiously she became a girl again,\\nand the bird\\'s body with its soft gray feathers completely disappeared.\\n\\nAs she felt herself changing she called: \"Good-bye!\" to the bluejay;\\nbut even then he could hardly understand her words.\\n\\n\"Good-bye!\" he answered, and to Twinkle\\'s ears it sounded like\\n\"Chir-r-rip-chee-wee!\"\\n\\n\"How did it feel?\" asked Chubbins; but she looked at him queerly, as if\\nhis language was strange to her, and seemed to be half frightened.\\n\\n\"Guess I\\'ll have to eat my berry,\" he said, with a laugh, and proceeded\\nto pluck and eat it, as Twinkle had done. He yelled once or twice at\\nthe cramp the fruit gave him, but as soon as the pain ceased he began\\nto grow and change in the same way his little comrade had.\\n\\nBut not entirely. For although he got his human body and legs back\\nagain, all in their natural size, his wings remained as they were, and\\nit startled him to find that the magic power had passed and he was\\nstill partly a bird.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Twinkle.\\n\\n\"Is anything wrong?\" enquired the bluejay.\\n\\nThe boy understood them both, although they could not now understand\\neach other. He said to Twinkle:\\n\\n\"I guess the berry wasn\\'t quite big enough.\" Then he repeated the same\\nthing in the bird language to Policeman Bluejay, and it sounded to\\nTwinkle like:\\n\\n\"Pir-r-r-r--eep--cheep--tweet!\"\\n\\n\"What in the world can you do?\" asked the girl, quite distressed. \"It\\nwill be just dreadful if you have to stay like that.\"\\n\\nThe tears came to Chubbins\\' eyes. He tried to restrain them, but could\\nnot. He flapped his little wings dolefully and said:\\n\\n\"I wish I was either one thing or the other! I\\'d rather be a child-lark\\nagain, and nest in a tree, than to go home to the folks in this way.\"\\n\\nPoliceman Bluejay had seen his dilemma at the first, and his sharp eyes\\nhad been roving over all the bushes that were within the range of his\\nvision. Suddenly he uttered a chirp of delight and dashed away,\\nspeedily returning with another tingle-berry in his bill.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the very last one there is!\" said he to Chubbins.\\n\\n\"But it is all that I want,\" cried the boy, brightening at once; and\\nthen, regardless of any pain, he ate the berry as greedily as if he was\\nfond of a stomache-ache.\\n\\nThe second berry had a good effect in one way, for Chubbins\\' wings\\nquickly became arms, and he was now as perfectly formed as he had been\\nbefore he met with the cruel tuxix. But he gave a groan, every once in\\na while, and Twinkle suspected that two berries were twice as powerful\\nas one, and made a pain that lasted twice as long.\\n\\nAs the boy and girl looked around they were astonished to find their\\nbasket standing on the ground beside them. On a limb of the first tree\\nof the forest sat silently regarding them a big blue bird that they\\nknew must be Policeman Bluejay, although somehow or other he had lost\\nhis glossy black helmet and the club he had carried underneath his\\nwing.\\n\\n\"It\\'s almost dark,\" said Twinkle, yawning. \"Let\\'s go home, Chub.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\"\\n\\nHe picked up the basket, and for a few minutes they walked along in\\nsilence.\\n\\nThen the boy asked:\\n\\n\"Don\\'t your legs feel heavy, Twink?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"do yours?\"\\n\\n\"Awful,\" said he.\\n\\n\\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\nL.

It is a handsome building, surrounded by a\\nfinely timbered park of some extent, and, what is more important, by\\nabout 12,000 acres of land, which also appertain to it.  At the period\\nin which I commence this history, there resided in this mansion an\\nelderly spinster of rank, named the Honourable Miss Delmar, sister of\\nthe late Lord de Versely and aunt to the present earl, and an Honourable\\nCaptain Delmar, who was the second son of the deceased nobleman.  This\\nproperty belonged to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was at her entire\\ndisposal upon her decease.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar, at the time I am speaking of, commanded a\\nfrigate employed upon what was designated channel service, which in\\nthose days implied that the captain held a seat in the House of Commons\\nand that he voted with the ministry; and further, that his vote might,\\nwhen required, be forthcoming, the frigate was never sea-going, except\\nduring the recess.  It must be admitted that H.M. ship Paragon did\\noccasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for\\ntwo or three days, until the steward reported that the milk provided for\\nthe captain\\'s table was turning sour; upon which important information\\nthe helm was immediately put up, and the frigate, in a case of such\\nextreme distress, would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her\\nlee.  Now as the Paragon was constantly at Spithead, Captain Delmar was\\nvery attentive in visiting his aunt, who lived at Madeline Hall;\\nill-natured people asserted, because she had so fine an estate in her\\nown gift.  Certain it is, that he would remain there for weeks, which\\ngave great satisfaction to the old lady, who liked her nephew, liked\\nattention, and was even so peculiar as to like sailors.  But it must be\\nobserved that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the\\ncaptain, liked attention, and liked sailors; this was Miss Arabella\\nMason, a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age, who\\nconstantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seen\\na face which she preferred to her own, and who never read any novel\\nwithout discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the\\nheroine and her pretty self.\\n\\nMiss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old\\nLord de Versely, brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was much\\nrespected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of\\nbusiness, in the transaction of which he fell, for he was felling trees,\\nand a tree fell upon him.  He left a widow and two daughters: it was\\nsaid that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off, as her husband had\\nbeen very careful of his earnings.  Mrs Mason, however, did not\\ncorroborate this statement; on the contrary, she invariably pleaded\\npoverty; and the Honourable Miss Delmar, after Lord de Versely\\'s death--\\nwhich happened soon after that of his steward--sent both the daughters\\nto be educated at a country school, where, as everything that is taught\\nis second-rate, young ladies, of course, receive a second-rate\\neducation.  Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar\\nto spend a month at Madeline Hall, and used to bring her eldest\\ndaughter, who had left school, with her.  Latterly, however, the\\ndaughter remained as a fixture, and Mrs Mason received but an\\noccasional invitation.  It may be inquired in what capacity Miss\\nArabella Mason remained at the Hall; she was not a servant, for her\\nposition in life was above that of a menial; neither was she received\\naltogether in the saloon, as she was of too humble a grade to mix with\\ngentry and nobility; she was, therefore, betwixt and between, a sort of\\nhumble companion in the drawing-room, a cut above the housekeeper in the\\nstill-room, a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinster\\'s wishes, a\\nsort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants,\\ntowards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion.  However this\\nposition might be found useful to her mistress, it must be admitted that\\nit was a most unfortunate position for a young, thoughtless, and very\\npretty girl, moreover, who was naturally very lively, very smart in\\nrepartee, and very fond of being admired.\\n\\nAs the Honourable Captain Delmar was very constant in his visits to his\\naunt, it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her\\nhumble companion.  By degrees the intimacy increased, and at last there\\nwere reports in the servants\\' hall, that the captain and Miss Bella\\nMason had been seen together in the evergreen walk; and as the captain\\'s\\nvisits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did\\nthe scandal increase, and people became more ill-natured.  It was now\\nseen that Miss Bella had been very often found in tears, and the old\\nbutler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like\\nresponsive mandarins; the only person who was ignorant of the scandal\\nafloat was the old lady spinster herself.\\n\\nI must now introduce another personage.  The Honourable Captain Delmar\\ndid not, of course, travel without his valet, and this important\\npersonage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been\\ndrafted into the frigate.  Benjamin Keene, for such was his name, was\\ncertainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a\\nvalet; he was very clean in his person, very respectful in his\\ndeportment, and, after the sovereign of Great Britain, looked upon the\\nHonourable Captain Delmar as the greatest person in the world.\\nMoreover, Benjamin Keene, although only a private marine was, without\\nexception, one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being\\nequally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person, he\\nwas the admiration of all the young women.  But Nature, who delights in\\na drawback, had contrived to leave him almost without brains; and\\nfurther, he was wholly uneducated--for he was too stupid to learn--his\\nfaculties were just sufficient to enable him, by constant drilling, to\\nbe perfect in the manual exercise, and mechanically to perform his\\nduties as a valet.\\n\\nBen always accompanied his master to the hall, where the former was at\\none and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants.\\nIt hardly need be observed, that the clever and sprightly Miss Arabella\\nMason considered Ben as one much beneath her, that is, she said so on\\nhis first arrival at Madeline hall; but, strange to say, that two years\\nafterwards, just at the time that reports had been raised that she had\\nbeen frequently discovered in tears, there was a change in her manner\\ntowards him; indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap\\nat the handsome marine: this idea, it is true, was ridiculed by the\\nmajority; but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase.  It was\\nafterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken\\nplace, that Ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal\\nmatch had he not been prompted to it by his master, who actually\\nproposed that he should marry the girl.  That such was the fact is\\nundoubted, although they knew it not; and Ben, who considered the wish\\nof his captain as tantamount to an order, as soon as he could comprehend\\nwhat his captain required of him, stood up erect and raised his hand\\nwith a flourish to his head, in token of his obedience.  Shortly\\nafterwards, Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall, accompanied\\nas usual, by Ben, and the second day after their arrival it was made\\nknown to all whom it might concern, that Miss Arabella Mason had\\nactually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene.\\n\\nOf course, the last person made acquainted with this interesting\\nintelligence was the Honourable Miss Delmar, and her nephew took upon\\nhimself to make the communication.  At first the honourable spinster\\nbridled up with indignation, wondered at the girl\\'s indelicacy, and much\\nmore at her demeaning herself by marrying a private marine.  Captain\\nDelmar replied, that it was true that Ben was only a private, but that\\nevery common soldier was a gentleman by profession.  It was true that\\nBella Mason might have done better--but she was his aunt\\'s servant, and\\nKeene was his valet, so that the disparity was not so very great.  He\\nthen intimated that he had long perceived the growing attachment; talked\\nof the danger of young people being left so much together; hinted about\\nopportunity, and descanted upon morals and propriety.  The Honourable\\nMiss Delmar was softened down by the dexterous reasoning of her nephew;\\nshe was delighted to find so much virtue extant in a sailor; and, after\\nan hour\\'s conversation, the married couple were sent for, graciously\\npardoned, and Mrs Keene, after receiving a very tedious lecture,\\nreceived a very handsome present.  But if her mistress was appeased,\\nMrs Keene\\'s mother was not.  As soon as the intelligence was received,\\nold Mrs Mason set off for Madeline Hall.  She first had a closeted\\ninterview with her daughter, and then with Captain Delmar, and as soon\\nas the latter was over, she immediately took her departure, without\\npaying her respects to the mistress of the Hall, or exchanging one word\\nwith any of the servants; this conduct gave occasion to more\\ninnuendoes--some indeed ascribed her conduct to mortification at her\\ndaughter\\'s having made so imprudent a match, but others exchanged very\\nsignificant glances.\\n\\nThree weeks after the marriage, the Parliament having been prorogued,\\nthe admiral of the port considered that he was justified in ordering the\\nfrigate out on a cruise.  Ben Keene, of course accompanied his master,\\nand it was not until three months had passed away that the frigate\\nreturned into port.  As usual, the Honourable Captain Delmar, as soon as\\nhe had paid his respects to the admiral, set off to visit his aunt,\\naccompanied by his benedict marine.  On his arrival, he found that\\neverything appeared to be in great confusion; indeed an event was\\noccurring which had astonished the whole household; the butler made a\\nprofound bow to the captain; the footmen forgot their usual smirk when\\nhe alighted.  Captain Delmar was ushered in solemn silence into the\\ndrawing-room, and his aunt, who had notice of his arrival received him\\nwith a stiff, prim air of unwonted frigidity, with her arms crossed\\nbefore her on her white muslin apron.\\n\\n\"My dear aunt,\" said Captain Delmar, as she coldly took his proffered\\nhand, \"what is the matter?\"\\n\\n\"The matter is this, nephew,\" replied the old lady--\"that marriage of\\nyour marine and Bella Mason should have taken place six months sooner\\nthan it did.  This is a wicked world, nephew; and sailors, I\\'m afraid,\\nare--\"\\n\\n\"Marines, you should say, in this instance, my dear aunt,\" replied\\nCaptain Delmar, insinuatingly.  \"I must confess that neither sailors nor\\nmarines are quite so strict as they ought to be; however, Ben has\\nmarried her.  Come, my dear aunt, allow me to plead for them, although I\\nam very much distressed that such an event should take place in your\\nhouse.  I think,\" added he, after a pause, \"I shall give Mr Keene seven\\ndozen at the gangway, for his presumption, as soon as I return on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t mend the matter, nephew,\" replied Miss Delmar.  \"I\\'ll turn\\nher out of the house as soon as she can be moved.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll flog him as soon as I get him on board,\" rejoined the captain.\\n\"I will not have your feelings shocked, and your mind harassed in this\\nway, by any impropriety on the part of my followers--most infamous--\\nshameful--abominable--unpardonable,\" interjected the captain, walking\\nthe quarter-deck up and down the room.\\n\\nThe Honourable Miss Delmar continued to talk, and the honourable captain\\nto agree with her in all she said, for an hour at least.  When people\\nare allowed to give vent to their indignation without the smallest\\nopposition they soon talk it away; such was the case with the Honourable\\nMiss Delmar.  When it was first announced that Bella Keene was safely in\\nbed with a fine boy, the offended spinster turned away from the\\ncommunication with horror; when her own maid ventured to remark that it\\nwas a lovely baby, she was ordered to hold her tongue; she would not see\\nthe suffering mother, and the horrid marine was commanded to stay in the\\nkitchen, lest she should be contaminated by meeting him on the stairs;\\nbut every day softened down her indignation, and before a fortnight was\\nover the Honourable Miss Delmar had not only seen but admired the baby;\\nand at last decided upon paying a visit to the mother, who was now\\nsufficiently recovered to undergo a lecture of about two hours\\' length,\\nin which the honourable spinster commented upon her _in_decency,\\n_in_discretion, _in_considerateness, _in_correctness, _in_decorum,\\n_in_continence, and _in_delicacy; pointing out that her conduct was most\\ninexcusable, iniquitous, and most infamous.  The Honourable Miss Delmar\\nhaving had such a long innings then gave it up, because she was out of\\nbreath.  Bella, who waited patiently to make her response, and who was a\\nvery clever girl, then declared, with many tears, that she was aware\\nthat her conduct was _in_excusable, her faults had been _in_voluntary,\\nand her sorrow was _in_expressible; her _in_experience and her\\n_in_fatuation her only apology; that her _in_felicity at her mistress\\'s\\ndispleasure would _in_evitably increase her sufferings; assured her that\\nshe was not _in_corrigible, and that if her mistress would only indulge\\nher with forgiveness, as she hoped to _in_herit heaven she would never\\n_in_cur her anger by committing the same fault again.  Satisfied with\\nthis assurance, the Honourable Miss Delmar softened down, and not only\\nforgave, but actually took the child into her lap that Bella might read\\nthe Bible which she had presented her with.  Reader, the child who had\\nthis great honour conferred upon him, who actually laid in the\\nimmaculate lap, on the apron of immaculate snowy whiteness of the\\nimmaculate Honourable Miss Delmar, was no other person than the narrator\\nof this history--or, if you please it, the Hero of this Tale.\\n\\nThat my mother had so far smoothed things pretty well must be\\nacknowledged; but it was to be presumed that her husband might not be\\npleased at so unusual an occurrence, and already the sneers and\\ninnuendoes of the servants\\' hall were not wanting.  It appeared,\\nhowever, that an interview had taken place between Ben and Captain\\nDelmar shortly after my making my appearance: what occurred did not\\ntranspire, but this is certain that, upon the marine\\'s return to the\\nkitchen, one of the grooms, who ventured to banter him, received such a\\nsound thrashing from Ben that it put an end to all further joking.  As\\nBen had taken up the affair so seriously, it was presumed that if there\\nhad been anticipation of the hymeneal rites he was himself the party who\\nhad been hasty; and that now he was married, he was resolved to resent\\nany impertinent remarks upon his conduct.  At all events, the question\\nnow became one of less interest, as the scandal was of less importance;\\nand as Ben had made known his determination to resent any remarks upon\\nthe subject, not a word more was said, at all events when he was\\npresent.\\n\\nIn due time I was christened, and so completely was my mother\\nreinstalled in the good graces of her mistress, that as Captain Delmar\\nhad volunteered to stand my sponsor, the Honourable Miss Delmar gave the\\nnecessary female security; at the particular request of my mother, the\\ncaptain consented that I should bear his own Christian name, and I was\\nduly registered in the church books as Percival Keene.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO.\\n\\nThere is no security in this world.  A dissolution of Parliament took\\nplace, and on the following election the Honourable Captain Delmar\\'s\\nconstituents, not being exactly pleased at the total indifference which\\nhe had shown to their interests, took upon themselves to elect another\\nmember in his stead, who, as Captain Delmar had previously done,\\npromised everything, and in all probability would follow the honourable\\ncaptain\\'s example by performing nothing.  The loss of his election was\\nfollowed up by the loss of his ship, his majesty\\'s government not\\nconsidering it necessary that Captain Delmar (now that he had leisure to\\nattend to his professional duties) should retain his command.  The\\nfrigate, therefore, was paid off, and recommissioned by another captain\\nwho had friends in Parliament.\\n\\nAs Ben Keene belonged to the marine corps, he could not, of course,\\nremain as valet to Captain Delmar, but was ordered, with the rest of the\\ndetachment, to the barracks at Chatham; my mother, although she was\\ndetermined that she would not live at barracks, was not sorry to leave\\nthe Hall, where she could not fail to perceive that she was, from her\\nimprudent conduct, no longer treated with the respect or cordiality to\\nwhich she had been previously accustomed.  She was most anxious to quit\\na place in which her disgrace was so well known; and Captain Delmar\\nhaving given her his advice, which coincided with her own ideas, and\\nalso a very munificent present to enable her to set up housekeeping,\\ntook his departure from the Hall.  My mother returned to her room as the\\nwheels of his carriage rattled over the gravel of the drive, and many\\nwere the bitter tears which she shed over her unconscious boy.\\n\\nThe following day the Honourable Miss Delmar sent for her; as usual,\\ncommenced with a tedious lecture, which, as before, was wound up at\\nparting with a handsome present.  The day after my mother packed up her\\ntrunks, and with me in her arms set off to Chatham, where we arrived\\nsafely, and immediately went into furnished lodgings.  My mother was a\\nclever, active woman, and the presents which she had at different times\\nreceived amounted to a considerable sum of money, over which her husband\\nhad never ventured to assert any claim.\\n\\nIndeed, I must do Ben Keene the justice to say that he had the virtue of\\nhumility.  He felt that his wife was in every way his superior and that\\nit was only under peculiar circumstances that he could have aspired to\\nher.  He was, therefore, submissive to her in everything, consenting to\\nevery proposal that was made by her, and guided by her opinion.  When,\\ntherefore, on her arrival at Chatham, she pointed out how impossible it\\nwould be for one brought up as she had been to associate with the women\\nin the barracks, and that she considered it advisable that she should\\nset up some business by which she might gain a respectable livelihood,\\nBen, although he felt that this would be a virtual separation _a mensa\\net thoro_, named no objections.  Having thus obtained the consent of her\\nhusband, who considered her so much his superior as to be infallible, my\\nmother, after much cogitation, resolved that she would embark her\\ncapital in a circulating library and stationer\\'s shop; for she argued\\nthat selling paper, pens, and sealing-wax was a commerce which would\\nsecure to her customers of the better class.  Accordingly, she hired a\\nhouse close to the barracks, with a very good-sized shop below, painting\\nand papering it very smartly; there was much taste in all her\\narrangements, and although the expenses of the outlay and the first\\nyear\\'s rent had swallowed up a considerable portion of the money she had\\nlaid by, it soon proved that she had calculated well, and her shop\\nbecame a sort of lounge for the officers, who amused themselves with her\\nsmartness and vivacity, the more so as she had a talent for repartee,\\nwhich men like to find in a very pretty woman.\\n\\nIn a short time my mother became quite the rage, and it was a mystery\\nhow so pretty and elegant a person could have become the wife of a\\nprivate marine.  It was however, ascribed to her having been captivated\\nwith the very handsome person and figure of her husband, and having\\nyielded to her feelings in a moment of infatuation.  The ladies\\npatronised her circulating library; the officers and gentlemen purchased\\nher stationery.  My mother then added gloves, perfumery, canes, and\\nlastly cigars, to her previous assortment and before she had been a year\\nin business, found that she was making money very fast, and increasing\\nher customers every day.  My mother had a great deal of tact; with the\\nother sex she was full of merriment and fond of joking, consequently a\\ngreat favourite; towards her own sex her conduct was quite the reverse;\\nshe assumed a respectful, prudish air, blended with a familiarity which\\nwas never offensive; she was, therefore, equally popular with her own\\nsex, and prospered in every sense of the word.  Had her husband been the\\nleast inclined to have asserted his rights, the position which she had\\ngained was sufficient to her reducing him to a state of subjection.  She\\nhad raised herself, unaided, far above him; he saw her continually\\nchatting and laughing with his own officers, to whom he was compelled to\\nmake a respectful salute whenever they passed by him; he could not\\nventure to address her, or even to come into the shop, when his officers\\nwere there, or it would have been considered disrespectful towards them;\\nand as he could not sleep out of barracks, all his intercourse with her\\nwas to occasionally slink down by the area, to find something better to\\neat than he could have in his own mess, or obtain from her an occasional\\nshilling to spend in beer.  Ben, the marine, found at last that somehow\\nor another, his wife had slipped out of his hands; that he was nothing\\nmore than a pensioner on her bounty a slave to her wishes, and a fetcher\\nand carrier at her command, and he resigned himself quietly to his fate,\\nas better men have done before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE.\\n\\nI think that the reader will agree with me that my mother showed in her\\nconduct great strength of character.  She had been compelled to marry a\\nman whom she despised, and to whom she felt herself superior in every\\nrespect; she had done so to save her reputation.  That she had been in\\nerror is true but situation and opportunity had conspired against her;\\nand when she found out the pride and selfishness of the man to whom she\\nwas devoted, and for whom she had sacrificed so much,--when her ears\\nwere wounded by proposals from his lips that she should take such a step\\nto avoid the scandal arising from their intimacy--when at the moment\\nthat he made such a proposition, and the veil fell down and revealed the\\nheart of man in its selfishness, it is not to be wondered that, with\\nbitter tears, arising from wounded love, anger, and despair at her\\nhopeless position, she consented.  After having lost all she valued,\\nwhat did she care for the future?  It was but one sacrifice more to\\nmake, one more proof of her devotion and obedience.  But there are few\\nwomen who, like my mother, would have recovered her position to the\\nextent that she did.  Had she not shown such determination, had she\\nconsented to have accompanied her husband to the barracks, and have\\nmixed up with the other wives of the men, she would have gradually sunk\\ndown to their level; to this she could not consent.  Having once freed\\nherself from her thraldom, he immediately sunk down to his level, as she\\nrose up to a position in which, if she could not ensure more than\\ncivility and protection, she was at all events secure from insult and\\nill-treatment.\\n\\nSuch was the state of affairs when I had arrived at the important age of\\nsix years, a comic-looking, laughing urchin, petted by the officers, and\\nas fall of mischief as a tree full of monkeys.  My mother\\'s business had\\nso much increased, that, about a year previous to this date, she had\\nfound it necessary to have some one to assist her, and had decided upon\\nsending for her sister Amelia to live with her.  It was, however,\\nnecessary to obtain her mother\\'s consent.  My grandmother had never seen\\nmy mother since the interview which she had had with her at Madeline\\nHall shortly after her marriage with Ben the marine.  Latterly, however,\\nthey had corresponded; for my mother, who was too independent to seek\\nher mother when she was merely the wife of a private marine, now that\\nshe was in flourishing circumstances had first tendered the olive\\nbranch, which had been accepted, as soon as my grandmother found that\\nshe was virtually separated from her husband.  As my grandmother found\\nit rather lonely at the isolated house in which she resided, and Amelia\\ndeclared herself bored to death, it was at last agreed that my\\ngrandmother and my aunt Amelia should both come and take up their\\nresidence with my mother, and in due time they arrived.  Milly, as my\\naunt was called, was three years younger than my mother, very pretty and\\nas smart as her sister, perhaps a little more demure in her look, but\\nwith more mischief in her disposition.  My grandmother was a cross,\\nspiteful old woman; she was very large in her person, but very\\nrespectable in her appearance.  I need not say that Miss Amelia did not\\nlessen the attraction at the circulating library, which after her\\narrival was even more frequented by the officers than before.\\n\\nMy aunt Milly was very soon as fond of me as I was of mischief; indeed\\nit is not to be wondered at, for I was a type of the latter.  I soon\\nloved her better than my mother, for she encouraged me in all my tricks.\\nMy mother looked grave, and occasionally scolded me; my grandmother\\nslapped me hard and rated me continually; but reproof or correction from\\nthe two latter were of no avail; and the former, when she wished to play\\nany trick which she dared not do herself, employed me as her agent; so\\nthat I obtained the whole credit for what were her inventions, and I may\\nsafely add, underwent the whole blame and punishment; but that I cared\\nnothing for; her caresses, cakes, and sugar-plums, added to my natural\\npropensity, more than repaid me for the occasional severe rebukes of my\\nmother, and the vindictive blows I received from the long fingers of my\\nworthy grandmother.  Moreover, the officers took much notice of me, and\\nit must be admitted, that, although I positively refused to learn my\\nletters, I was a very forward child.  My great patron was a Captain\\nBridgeman, a very thin, elegantly-made man, who was continually\\nperforming feats of address and activity; occasionally I would escape\\nwith him and go down to the mess, remain at dinner, drink toasts, and,\\nstanding on the mess-table, sing two or three comic songs which he had\\ntaught me.  I sometimes returned a little merry with the bumpers, which\\nmade my mother very angry, my old grandmother to hold up her hands, and\\nlook at the ceiling through her spectacles, and my aunt Milly as merry\\nas myself.  Before I was eight years old, I had become so notorious,\\nthat any prank played in the town, any trick undiscovered, was\\ninvariably laid to my account; and many were the applications made to my\\nmother for indemnification for broken windows and other damage done, too\\noften, I grant, with good reason, but very often when I had been\\nperfectly innocent of the misdemeanour.  At last I was voted a common\\nnuisance, and every one, except my mother and my aunt Milly, declared\\nthat it was high time that I went to school.\\n\\nOne evening the whole of the family were seated at tea in the back\\nparlour.  I was sitting very quietly and demurely in a corner, a sure\\nsign that I was in mischief, and so indeed I was (for I was putting a\\nlittle gunpowder into my grandmother\\'s snuff-box, which I had purloined,\\njust that she might \"smell powder,\" as they say at sea, without danger\\nof life or limb), when the old woman addressed my mother--\\n\\n\"Bella, is that boy never going to school? it will be the ruin of him.\"\\n\\n\"What will be the ruin of him, mother?\" rejoined my aunt Milly; \"going\\nto school?\"\\n\\n\"Hold your nonsense, child: you are as bad as the boy himself,\" replied\\ngranny.  \"Boys are never ruined by education; girls sometimes are.\"\\n\\nWhether my mother thought that this was an innuendo reflecting upon any\\nportion of her own life, I cannot tell; but she replied very tartly.\\n\\n\"You\\'re none the worse for my education, mother, or you would not be\\nsitting here.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, child,\" replied granny; \"but recollect, neither would you\\nhave married a marine--a private marine, Bella, while your sister looks\\nup to the officers.  Ay,\" continued the old woman, leaving off her\\nknitting and looking at her daughter, \"and is likely to get one, too, if\\nshe plays her cards well--that Lieutenant Flat can\\'t keep out of the\\nshop.\"  (My granny having at this moment given me an opportunity to\\nreplace her snuff-box, I did not fail to profit by it; and as I\\nperceived her knitting-pin had dropped on the floor, I stuck it into the\\nskirt of her gown behind, so that whenever she looked for it, it was\\ncertain ever to be behind her.)\\n\\n\"Mr Flat is of a very respectable family, I hear say,\" continued my\\ngrandmother.\\n\\n\"And a great fool,\" interrupted my mother.  \"I hope Milly won\\'t listen\\nto him.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s an officer,\" replied my granny, \"not a private.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I prefer my private marine, for I can make him do as I\\nplease; if he\\'s a private, I\\'m commanding officer, and intend so to be\\nas long as I live.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, Bella, let us say no more on the old score; but that boy\\nmust go to school.  Deary me, I have dropped my needle.\"\\n\\nMy grandmother rose, and turned round and round, looking for her needle,\\nwhich, strange to say, she could not find; she opened her snuff-box, and\\ntook a pinch to clear her optics.  \"Deary me, why, what\\'s the matter\\nwith my snuff? and where can that needle be?  Child, come and look for\\nthe needle; don\\'t be sticking there in that corner.\"\\n\\nI thought proper to obey the order and pretended to be very diligent in\\nmy search.  Catching aunt Milly\\'s eye, I pointed to the knitting-needle\\nsticking in the hind skirts of my grandmother\\'s gown, and then was down\\non my knees again, while my aunt held her handkerchief to her mouth to\\ncheck her laughter.\\n\\nA minute afterwards, Ben the marine first tapped gently, and then opened\\nthe door and came in; for at that late hour the officers were all at\\ndinner, and the shop empty.\\n\\n\"There are three parcels of books for you to take,\" said my mother; \"but\\nyou\\'ve plenty of time, so take down the tea-things, and get your tea in\\nthe kitchen before you go.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t got a shilling, Bella, about you?  I want some \\'baccy,\"\\nsaid Ben, in his quiet way.\\n\\n\"Yes, here\\'s a shilling, Ben; but don\\'t drink too much beer,\" replied my\\nmother.\\n\\n\"Deary me, what can have become of my needle?\" exclaimed my grandmother,\\nturning round.\\n\\n\"Here it is, ma\\'am,\" said Ben, who perceived it sticking in her skirt.\\n\"That\\'s Percival\\'s work, I\\'ll answer for it.\"\\n\\nMy granny received the needle from Ben, and then turned to me: \"You\\ngood-for-nothing boy; so you put the needle there, did you? pretending\\nto look for it all the while; you shall go to school, sir, that you\\nshall.\"\\n\\n\"You said a needle, granny; I was looking for a needle: you didn\\'t say\\nyour knitting-pin; I could have told you where that was.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, those who hide can find; to school you go, or I\\'ll not stay\\nin the house.\"\\n\\nBen took the tea-tray out of the room.  He had been well drilled in and\\nout of barracks.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go down in the kitchen to father,\" cried I, for I was tired of\\nsitting still.\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t, sir,\" said my mother, \"you naughty boy; the kitchen is\\nnot the place for you, and if ever I hear of you smoking a pipe again--\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman smokes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, he smokes cigars; but a child like you must not smoke a\\npipe.\"\\n\\n\"And now come here, sir,\" said my granny, who had the lid of her\\nsnuff-box off, and held it open in her hand; \"what have you been doing\\nwith my snuff?\"\\n\\n\"Why, granny, have I had your snuff-box the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"How should I know?--a boy like you, with every finger a fish-hook; I do\\nbelieve you have; I only wish I could find you out.  I had fresh snuff\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps they made a mistake at the shop, mother,\" said aunt Milly;\\n\"they are very careless.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can\\'t tell: I must have some more; I can\\'t take this.\"\\n\\n\"Throw it in the fire, granny,\" said I; \"and I\\'ll run with the box and\\nget it full again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it\\'s the best thing I can do,\" replied the old woman,\\nwho went to the grate, and leaning over, poured the snuff out on the\\nlive coals.  The result was a loud explosion and a volume of smoke,\\nwhich burst out of the grate into her face--the dinner and lappets\\nsinged, her spectacles lifted from her nose, and her face as black as a\\nsweep\\'s.  The old woman screamed, and threw herself back; in so doing,\\nshe fell over the chair upon which she had been sitting, and, somehow or\\nanother, tripped me up, and lay with all her weight upon me.  I had been\\njust attempting to make my escape during the confusion--for my mother\\nand Milly were equally frightened--when I found myself completely\\nsmothered by the weight of my now almost senseless granny, and, as I\\nhave before mentioned, she was a very corpulent woman.  Had I been in\\nany other position I should not have suffered so much; but I had\\nunfortunately fallen flat on my back, and was now lying with my face\\nupwards, pressed upon by the broadest part of the old woman\\'s body; my\\nnose was flattened, and my breath completely stopped.  How long my\\ngranny might have remained there groaning I cannot tell; probably, as I\\nwas somewhat a spoiled child before this, it might have ended in her\\ncompletely finishing me; but she was roused up from her state of half\\nsyncope by a vigorous attack from my teeth, which, in the agony of\\nsuffocation, I used with preternatural force of jaw from one so young.\\nI bit right through everything she had on, and as my senses were fast\\ndeparting, my teeth actually met with my convulsive efforts.  My granny,\\nroused by the extreme pain, rolled over on her side, and then it was\\nthat my mother and aunt, who supposed that I had made my escape from the\\nroom, discovered me lifeless, and black in the face.  They ran to me,\\nbut I still held on with my teeth, nor could I be separated from my now\\nscreaming relative, until the admission of fresh air, and a plentiful\\nsprinkling of cold water brought me to my senses, when I was laid on the\\nsofa utterly exhausted.  It certainly was a narrow escape, and it may be\\nsaid that the \"biter was nearly bit.\"  As for my granny, she recovered\\nher fright and her legs, but she did not recover her temper; she could\\nnot sit down without a pillow on the chair for many days, and, although\\nlittle was said to me in consequence of the danger I had incurred, yet\\nthere was an evident abhorrence of me on the part of the old woman, a\\nquiet manner about my mother, and a want of her usual hilarity on the\\npart of my aunt, which were to me a foreboding of something unpleasant.\\nA few days brought to light what was the result of various whisperings\\nand consultations.  It was on a fine Monday morning, that Ben made his\\nappearance at an unusually early hour; my cap was put on my head, my\\ncloak over my shoulders; Ben took me by the hand, having a covered\\nbasket in the other, and I was led away like a lamb to the butcher.  As\\nI went out there was a tear in the eyes of my aunt Milly, a melancholy\\nover the countenance of my mother, and a twinkling expression of\\nsatisfaction in my grandmother\\'s eyes, which even her spectacles could\\nnot conceal from me: the fact was, my grandmother had triumphed, and I\\nwas going to school.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR.\\n\\nAs soon as I was clear of the door, I looked up into Ben\\'s face and\\nsaid, \"Father, where are we going?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied he, \"I am going to take you to school.\"\\n\\n\"School!  What am I going to school for?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"For biting your grandmother, I expect, in the first place, and to get a\\nlittle learning, and a good deal of flogging, if what they say is true!\\nI never was at school myself.\"\\n\\n\"What do you learn, and why are you flogged?\"\\n\\n\"You learn to read, and to write, and to count; I can\\'t do either--\\nmore\\'s the pity; and you are flogged, because without flogging, little\\nboys can\\'t learn anything.\"\\n\\nThis was not a very satisfactory explanation.  I made no further\\ninquiries, and we continued our way in silence until we arrived at the\\nschool door; there was a terrible buzz inside.  Ben tapped, the door\\nopened, and a volume of hot air burst forth, all the fresh air having\\nbeen consumed in repeating the fresh lessons for the day.  Ben walked up\\nbetween the forms, and introduced me to the schoolmaster, whose name was\\nMr Thadeus O\\'Gallagher, a poor scholar from Ireland, who had set up an\\nestablishment at half-a-guinea a quarter for day scholars; he was\\nreckoned a very severe master, and the children were kept in better\\norder in his school than in any other establishment of the kind in the\\ntown; and I presume that my granny had made inquiries to that effect, as\\nthere were one or two schools of the same kind much nearer to my\\nmother\\'s house.  Ben, who probably had a great respect for learning, in\\nconsequence of his having none himself, gave a military salute to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, saying, with his hand still to his hat, \"A new boy, sir,\\ncome to school.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, by the powers! don\\'t I know him?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"it\\'s the\\nyoung gentleman who bit a hole in his grandmother; Master Keene, as they\\ncall him.  Keen teeth, at all events.  Lave him with me; and that\\'s his\\ndinner in the basket I presume; lave that too.  He\\'ll soon be a good\\nboy, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nBen put down the basket, turned on his heel, and left the schoolroom,\\nand me standing by the throne of my future pedagogue--I say throne,\\nbecause he had not a desk, as schoolmasters generally have, but a sort\\nof square dais, about eighteen inches high, on which was placed another\\noblong superstructure of the same height, serving him for a seat; both\\nparts were covered with some patched and torn old drugget, and upon\\nsubsequent examination I found them to consist of three old claret cases\\nwithout covers, which he had probably picked up very cheap; two of them\\nturned upside down, so as to form the lower square, and the third placed\\nin the same way upside down, upon the two lower.  Mr O\\'Gallagher sat in\\ngreat dignity upon the upper one, with his feet on the lower, being thus\\nsufficiently raised upon an eminence to command a view of the whole of\\nhis pupils in every part of the school.  He was not a tall man, but very\\nsquare built, with carroty hair and very bushy red whiskers; to me he\\nappeared a most formidable person, especially when he opened his large\\nmouth and displayed his teeth, when I was reminded of the sign of the\\nRed Lion close to my mother\\'s house.  I certainly never had been before\\nso much awed during my short existence as I was with the appearance of\\nmy pedagogue, who sat before me somewhat in the fashion of a Roman\\ntribune, holding in his hand a short round ruler, as if it were his\\ntruncheon of authority.  I had not been a minute in the school before I\\nobserved him to raise his arm; away went the ruler whizzing through the\\nair, until it hit the skull of the lad for whom it was intended at the\\nother end of the schoolroom.  The boy, who had been talking to his\\nneighbour, rubbed his poll, and whined.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you bring back my ruler, you spalpeen?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\"Be quick, Johnny Target, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nThe boy, who was not a little confused with the blow, sufficiently\\nrecovered his senses to obey the order, and whimpering as he came up,\\nreturned the ruler to the hands of Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"That tongue of yours will get you into more trouble than it will\\nbusiness, I expect, Johnny Target; it\\'s an unruly member, and requires a\\nconstant ruler over it.\"  Johnny Target rubbed his head and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said he, after a short pause, \"did you see what a\\ntundering tump on the head that boy got just now, and do you know what\\nit was for?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your manners, you animal?  No `If you plase.\\'  For the future,\\nyou must not forget to say, `No, sir,\\' or, `No, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\'  D\\'ye\\nmind me--now say yes--what?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what! you little ignoramus; say `yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\' and\\nrecollect, as the parish clerk says, `this is the last time of asking.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! now you see, there\\'s nothing like coming to school--you\\'ve learn\\'t\\nmanners already; and now, to go back again, as to why Johnny Target had\\nthe rap on the head, which brought tears into his eyes?  I\\'ll just tell\\nyou, it was for talking; you see, the first thing for a boy to learn, is\\nto hold his tongue, and that shall be your lesson for the day; you\\'ll\\njust sit down there and if you say one word during the whole time you\\nare in the school, it will end in a blow-up; that means, on the present\\noccasion, that I\\'ll skin you alive as they do the eels, which being\\nrather keen work, will just suit your constitution.\"  I had wit enough\\nto feel assured that Mr O\\'Gallagher was not to be trifled with, so I\\ntook my seat, and amused myself with listening to the various lessons\\nwhich the boys came up to say, and the divers punishments inflicted--few\\nescaped.  At last, the hour of recreation and dinner arrived, the boys\\nwere dismissed, each seized his basket, containing his provisions, or\\nran home to get his meal with his parents: I found myself sitting in the\\nschool-room _tete-a-tete_ with Mr O\\'Gallagher, and feeling very well\\ninclined for my dinner I cast a wistful eye at my basket, but I said\\nnothing; Mr O\\'Gallagher, who appeared to have been in thought, at last\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you may now go out of school, and scream till you\\'re hoarse,\\njust to make up for lost time.\"\\n\\n\"May I take my dinner, sir?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"Is it your dinner you mane?--to be sure you may; but, first, I\\'ll just\\nlook into the basket and its contents; for you see, Mr Keene, there\\'s\\nsome victuals that don\\'t agree with larning; and if you eat them, you\\'ll\\nnot be fit for your work when your play-hours are over.  What\\'s easy of\\ndigestion will do; but what\\'s bad for little boys\\' stomachs may get you\\ninto a scrape, and then it will end in a blow-up; that is, you\\'ll have a\\ntaste of the ferrule or the rod--two assistants of mine, to whom I\\'ve\\nnot yet had the pleasure of introducing you--all in good time.  If what\\nI\\'ve hear of you be true, you and they will be better acquainted afore\\nlong.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher then examined the contents of my basket; my aunt Milly\\nhad taken care that I should be well provided: there was a large paper\\nof beef sandwiches, a piece of bread and cheese, and three or four\\nslices of seed-cake.  Mr O\\'Gallagher opened all the packages, and,\\nafter a pause, said--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, d\\'ye think you would ever guess how I came by all my\\nlarning, and what I fed upon when it was pumped into me?  Then I\\'ll tell\\nyou; it was dry bread, with a little bit of cheese when I could get it,\\nand that wasn\\'t often.  Bread and cheese is the food to make a scholar\\nof ye; and mayhap one slice of the cake mayn\\'t much interfere, so take\\nthem, and run away to the play-ground as fast as you can; and, d\\'ye hear\\nme, Master Keene, recollect your grace before meat--`For what we have\\nreceived, the Lord make us truly thankful.\\'  Now, off wid you.  The rest\\nof the contents are confiscated for my sole use, and your particular\\nbenefit.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher grinned as he finished his oration; and he looked so\\nmuch like a wild beast, that I was glad to be off as fast as I could.  I\\nturned round as I went out of the door, and perceived that the\\nsandwiches were disappearing with wonderful rapidity; but I caught his\\neye: it was like that of a tiger\\'s at his meal, and I was off at\\nredoubled speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE.\\n\\nAs soon as I gained the play-ground, which was, in fact, nothing more\\nthan a small piece of waste land, to which we had no more claim than any\\nother people, I sat down by a post, and commenced my dinner off what Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had thought proper to leave me.  I was afraid of him, it is\\ntrue, for his severity to the other boys convinced me that he would have\\nlittle mercy upon me, if I dared to thwart him; but indignation soon\\nbegan to obtain the mastery over my fears and I began to consider if I\\ncould not be even with him for his barefaced robbery of my dinner; and\\nthen I reflected whether it would not be better to allow him to take my\\nfood if I found out that by so doing he treated me well; and I resolved,\\nat all events, to delay a little.  The hour of play was now over, and a\\nbell summoned us all to school; I went in with the others and took my\\nseat where Mr O\\'Gallagher had before desired me.\\n\\nAs soon as all was silent, my pedagogue beckoned me to him.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"you\\'ll be so good as to lend me your ears--\\nthat is, to listen while I talk to you a little bit.  D\\'ye know how many\\nroads there are to larning?  Hold your tongue.  I ask you because I know\\nyou don\\'t know, and because I\\'m going to tell you.  There are exactly\\nthree roads: the first is the eye, my jewel; and if a lad has a sharp\\neye like yours, it\\'s a great deal that will get into his head by that\\nroad; you\\'ll know a thing when you see it again, although you mayn\\'t\\nknow your own father--that\\'s a secret only known to your mother.  The\\nsecond road to larning, young spalpeen, is the ear; and if you mind all\\npeople say, and hear all you can, you\\'ll gain a great many truths and\\njust ten times as much more in the shape of lies.  You see the wheat and\\nthe chaff will come together, and you must pick the latter out of the\\nformer at any seasonable future opportunity.  Now we come to the third\\nroad to larning, which is quite a different sort of road; because, you\\nsee, the two first give us little trouble, and we trot along almost\\nwhether we will or not: the third and grand road is the head itself,\\nwhich requires the eye and the ear to help it; and two other assistants,\\nwhich we call memory and application; so you see we have the visual,\\nthen the aural, and then the mental roads--three hard words which you\\ndon\\'t understand, and which I shan\\'t take the trouble to explain to such\\nan animal as you are; for I never throw away pearls to swine, as the\\nsaying is.  Now, then, Mr Keene, we must come to another part of our\\nhistory.  As there are three roads to larning, so there are three manes\\nor implements by which boys are stimulated to larn: the first is the\\nruler, which you saw me shy at the thick skull of Johnny Target, and you\\nsee\\'d what a rap it gave him; well, then, the second is the ferrule--a\\nthing you never heard of, perhaps; but I\\'ll show it you; here it is,\"\\ncontinued Mr O\\'Gallagher, producing a sort of flat wooden ladle with a\\nhole in the centre of it.  \"The ruler is for the head, as you have seen;\\nthe ferrule is for the hand.  You have seen me use the ruler; now I\\'ll\\nshow you what I do with the ferrule.\"\\n\\n\"You Tommy Goskin, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nTommy Goskin put down his book, and came up to his master with a good\\ndeal of doubt in his countenance.\\n\\n\"Tommy Goskin, you didn\\'t say your lesson well to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I did, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\" replied Tommy, \"you said I did yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, sir, you didn\\'t say it well yesterday,\" continued Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"Yes I did, sir,\" replied the boy, whimpering.\\n\\n\"And is it you who dares to contradict me?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"at\\nall events, you won\\'t say it well to-morrow, so hold out your right\\nhand.\"\\n\\nPoor Tommy held it out, and roared lustily at the first blow, wringing\\nhis fingers with the smart.\\n\\n\"Now your left hand, sir; fair play is a jewel; always carry the dish\\neven.\"\\n\\nTommy received a blow on his left hand, which was followed up with\\nsimilar demonstrations of suffering.\\n\\n\"There sir you may go now,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"and mind you don\\'t do\\nit again; or else there\\'ll be a blow-up.  And now Master Keene, we come\\nto the third and last, which is the birch for the tail--here it is--have\\nyou ever had a taste?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, you have that pleasure to come, and come it will, I don\\'t\\ndoubt, if you and I are a few days longer acquainted.  Let me see--\"\\n\\nHere Mr O\\'Gallagher looked round the school, as if to find a culprit;\\nbut the boys, aware of what was going on, kept their eyes so attentively\\nto their books, that he could not discover one; at last he singled out a\\nfat chubby lad.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock came accordingly; evidently he gave himself up for lost.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, I just have been telling Master Keene that you\\'re the\\nbest Latin scholar in the whole school.  Now, sir, don\\'t make me out to\\nbe a liar--do me credit,--or, by the blood of the O\\'Gallaghers, I\\'ll\\nflog ye till you\\'re as thin as a herring.  What\\'s the Latin for a cocked\\nhat, as the Roman gentlemen wore with their _togeys_?\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock hesitated a few seconds, and then, without venturing a\\nword of remonstrance, let down his trousers.\\n\\n\"See now the guilty tief, he knows what\\'s coming.  Shame upon you,\\nWalter Puddock, to disgrace your preceptor so, and make him tell a lie\\nto young Master Keene.  Where\\'s Phil Mooney?  Come along, sir, and hoist\\nWalter Puddock: it\\'s no larning that I can drive into you, Phil, but\\nit\\'s sartain sure that by your manes I drive a little into the other\\nboys.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock, as soon as he was on the back of Phil Mooney, received a\\ndozen cuts with the rod, well laid on.  He bore it without flinching,\\nalthough the tears rolled down his cheeks.\\n\\n\"There, Walter Puddock, I told you it would end in a blow-up; go to your\\ndictionary, you dirty blackguard, and do more credit to your education\\nand superior instruction from a certain person who shall be nameless.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher laid the rod on one side, and then continued--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, I\\'ve just shown you the three roads to larning, and\\nalso the three implements to persuade little boys to larn; if you don\\'t\\ntravel very fast by the three first, why you will be followed up very\\nsmartly by the three last--a nod\\'s as good as a wink to a blind horse,\\nany day; and one thing more, you little spalpeen, mind that there\\'s more\\nmustard to the sandwiches to-morrow, or else it will end in a blow-up.\\nNow you\\'ve got the whole theory of the art of tuition, Master Keene;\\nplease the pigs, we\\'ll commence with the practice to-morrow.\"\\n\\nMy worthy pedagogue did not address me any more during that day; the\\nschool broke up at five, and I made haste home, thinking over all that\\nhad passed in the school-room.\\n\\nMy granny and mother were both anxious to know what had passed; the\\nfirst hoped that I had been flogged, the second that I had not, but I\\nrefused to communicate.  I assumed a haughty, indifferent air, for I was\\nangry with my mother, and as for my grandmother, I hated her.  Aunt\\nMilly, however, when we were alone, did not question me in vain.  I told\\nher all that had passed; she bade me be of good heart, and that I should\\nnot be ill-treated if she could help it.\\n\\nI replied, that if I were ill-treated, I would have my revenge somehow\\nor another.  I then went down to the barracks, to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him what had occurred.  He advised me to laugh at\\nthe ruler, the ferrule, and the rod.  He pointed out to me the necessity\\nof my going to school and learning to read and write, at the same time\\nwas very indignant at the conduct of Mr O\\'Gallagher, and told me to\\nresist in every way any injustice or tyranny, and that I should be sure\\nof his support and assistance, provided that I did pay attention to my\\nstudies.\\n\\nFortified by the advice and protection of my two great friends, I made\\nup my mind that I would learn as fast as I could, but if treated ill,\\nthat I would die a martyr, rather than yield to oppression; at all\\nevents, I would, if possible, play Mr O\\'Gallagher a trick for every\\nflogging or punishment I received; and with this laudable resolution I\\nwas soon fast asleep, too fast even to dream.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX.\\n\\nWhen my aunt Milly called me in the morning, that I might be up and have\\nmy breakfast in time for school, I felt as if two years had passed over\\nmy head during the last twenty-four hours.  I had never witnessed\\ntyranny until the day before, and my blood was heated with indignation:\\nI felt myself capable of anything and everything.\\n\\nMy anger was about as great towards my mother and grandmother for having\\nsent me to such a place, as it was against Mr O\\'Gallagher.  Instead of\\ngoing up and kissing my mother, I paid no attention to either her or my\\ngrandmother, much to the mortification of the former and surprise of the\\nlatter, who said, in a very cross manner, \"Where\\'s your manners, child?\\nwhy don\\'t you say good morning?\"\\n\\n\"Because I have not been long enough at school to learn manners,\\ngranny.\"\\n\\n\"Come and kiss me before you go, my child,\" said my mother.\\n\\n\"No, mother; you have sent me to school to be beat, and I never will\\nkiss you again.\"\\n\\n\"Naughty, good-for-nothing boy!\" exclaimed my granny; \"what a bad heart\\nyou must have.\"\\n\\n\"No, that he has not,\" cried my aunt Milly.  \"Sister should have\\ninquired what sort of a school it was before she sent him.\"\\n\\n\"I made every inquiry,\" replied my granny; \"he can\\'t play tricks there.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t I?\" cried I, \"but I will; and not only there but here.  I\\'ll be\\neven with you all; yes, I\\'ll be even with you, granny, if I die for it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you audacious wretch, I\\'ve great a mind to--\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you have, but recollect I can bite; you\\'d better be quiet,\\ngranny, or, as the master says, `it will end in a blow-up.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Only hear the little wretch,\" said my granny, lifting up her hands; \"I\\nshall see you hanged yet, you ungrateful child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not ungrateful,\" replied I, throwing my arms round Milly\\'s neck,\\nand kissing her with fervour; \"I can love those who love me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t love me?\" said my mother, reproachfully.\\n\\n\"I did yesterday, but I don\\'t now; but it\\'s time for me to go, aunt; is\\nmy basket ready?  I don\\'t want father to take me to school, I can do\\nwithout him, and when I don\\'t choose to go any more, I won\\'t; recollect\\nthat, mother.\"  So saying, I seized my basket and quitted the room.\\nThere was a long consultation, I found, after my departure: my mother,\\nwhen my aunt had informed her of Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s conduct, wished to\\nremove me instantly; my grandmother insisted upon it that there was not\\na word of truth in what I had said, and threatened that if I did not\\nremain at that very school, she would leave Chatham, and take my aunt\\nwith her.  As my mother could not part with aunt Milly, the consequence\\nwas, that my grandmother gained the day.\\n\\nI arrived in good time, and took my seat near my master.  I preferred\\ndoing this, as I had had a long conversation with Captain Bridgeman who\\ntold me that although Mr O\\'Gallagher had put the ruler down as\\npunishment Number 1, the ferrule Number 2, and the birch as Number 3,\\nand of course they were considered to be worse as the number rose, that\\nhe considered it to be the very contrary, as he had had them all well\\napplied when he was at school; he ordered me, therefore, never to hold\\nout my hand to the ferrule, by which refusal I should, of course, be\\nflogged; but he assured me that the birch, especially when it is given\\noften, was a mere nothing.  Now I considered that the surest way to\\navoid the ruler was to sit close to my master, who could then have no\\npretence for sending it at my head; the fact was I had determined to\\nsave the more noble portions of my body, and leave Mr O\\'Gallagher to do\\nwhat he pleased with the other: to do him justice, he lost no time.\\n\\n\"Come here, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"where\\'s your manners? why don\\'t you\\nsay good morning to your preceptor?  Can you read at all?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'ye know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I think I do, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I suppose about two out of six-and-twenty.  It\\'s\\nparticular attention that\\'s been paid to your education, I perceive;\\nyou\\'ve nothing to unlearn anyhow, that\\'s something.  Now, sir, do you\\nthink that a classical scholar and a gentleman born, like me, is to\\ndemane myself by hearing you puzzle at the alphabet?  You\\'re quite\\nmistaken, Mr Keene, you must gain your first elements second-hand; so\\nwhere\\'s Thimothy Ruddel?  You, Timothy Ruddel, you\\'ll just teach this\\nyoung Master Keene his whole alphabet, and take care, at the same time,\\nthat you know your own lessons, or it will end in a blow-up; and you,\\nMaster Keene, if you have not larnt your whole alphabet perfect by\\ndinner time, why you\\'ll have a small taste of Number 2, just as a hint\\nto what\\'s coming next.  Go along, you little ignorant blackguard; and\\nyou, Timothy Ruddel, look out for a taste of Number 3, if you don\\'t larn\\nhim and yourself all at once, and at the same time.\"\\n\\nI was very well pleased with this arrangement; I had resolved to learn,\\nand I was doubly stimulated to learn now, to save poor Timothy Ruddel\\nfrom an unjust punishment.\\n\\nIn the three hours I was quite perfect, and Timothy Ruddel, who was\\ncalled up before me, was also able to say his lesson without a blunder\\nvery much to the disappointment of Mr O\\'Gallagher, who observed, \"So\\nyou\\'ve slipped through my fingers, have you, this time, Master Timothy?\\nNever mind, I\\'ll have you yet; and, moreover, there\\'s Master Keene to go\\nthrough the fiery furnace.\"  Just before dinner time I was called up;\\nwith my memory of many of the letters, and the assistance I had received\\nfrom Timothy Ruddel, I felt very confident.\\n\\n\"What letter\\'s that, sir?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"A B C D E.\"\\n\\n\"You little blackguard, I\\'ll dodge you; you think to escape, you?\"\\n\\n\"V, X, P, O.\"\\n\\nMuch to Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s surprise I said them all without one mistake.\\nInstead of commendation I received abuse.  \"By all the powers,\"\\nexclaimed my pedagogue, \"but everything seems to go wrong to-day; my\\nhand has been completely idle; this will never do; didn\\'t you tell me,\\nMr Keene, that you didn\\'t know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"I said I knew some of them, sir.\"\\n\\n\"If my memory is correct, Mr Keene, you told me that you knew two out\\nof twenty-six.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, you said that.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just as much as to tell me, your preceptor, a classical scholar,\\nand a Milesian gentleman to boot, that I lie, for which I intend to have\\nsatisfaction, Mr Keene, I assure you.  You\\'re guilty in two counts, as\\nthey say at the Old Bailey, where you\\'ll be called up to some of these\\ndays, as sure as you stand there; one count is in telling me a lie, in\\nsaying you did not know your alphabet, when it\\'s quite clear that you\\ndid; and, secondly, in giving me the lie, by stating that I said what\\nyou said.  You thought to escape me, but you\\'re mistaken, Mr Keene; so\\nnow, if you please, we will just have a taste of Number 2.  Hould out\\nyour hand, Mr Keene: d\\'ye hear me sir? hould out your hand.\"\\n\\nBut this I positively refused to do.  \"You won\\'t, won\\'t you?  Well,\\nthen, we must increase the punishment for our contempt of court, and at\\nonce commence with Number 3, which we intended to reserve till\\nto-morrow.  Come along, Phil Mooney, there\\'s fresh mate for you to\\ncarry, and come out Number 3, here\\'s fresh ground for you to travel\\nover.\"\\n\\nPhil Mooney and the birch soon made their appearance: I was hoisted by\\nthe one and scourged by the other.\\n\\nThe first taste of the birch is anything but agreeable; I could only\\ncompare it to the dropping of molten lead.  I tried all I could to\\nprevent crying out, but it was impossible, and at last I roared like a\\nmad bull; and I was as mad as a bull, and as dangerous.  Could I have\\npicked up any weapon at the moment that I was dropped from the shoulders\\nof Phil Mooney, it would have gone hard with Mr O\\'Gallagher.  My rage\\nwas greater than my agony.  I stood when I had been landed, my chest\\nheaving, my teeth set fast, and my apparel still in disorder.  The\\nschool was dismissed, and I was left alone with the savage pedagogue,\\nwho immediately took up my basket, and began to rummage the contents.\\n\\n\"Make yourself decent, Mr Keene, and don\\'t be shocking my modesty, and\\ntaking away my appetite.  Did you mention the mustard, as I desired you?\\nUpon my faith, but you\\'re a nice boy and do justice to the\\nrepresentations of your grandmother, and when you see her you may tell\\nher that I did not forget the promise she exacted from me.  You forgot\\nall about the mustard, you little blackguard.  If Phil Mooney was here I\\nwould give you another taste to freshen your memory for to-morrow;\\nhowever, to-morrow will do as well, if the mistake\\'s not corrected.\\nHere, take your victuals, and good appetite to you, you little monster\\nof iniquity.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher tossed me some bread but this time reserved the cheese\\nfor his own eating.  I had adjusted my dress, and I therefore left the\\nschool-room.  I could not sit down without pain, so I leant against a\\npost: the bread remained in my hand untouched; had it been the greatest\\ndelicacy in the world I could not have tasted a morsel; I was giddy from\\nexcess of feeling, my thoughts were rapidly chasing each other when I\\nheard a voice close to me; I looked round, it was Walter Puddock, who\\nhad been flogged the day before.\\n\\n\"Never mind, Keene,\" said he, kindly; \"it hurts at first, but the more\\nyou get it the less you care for it; I don\\'t mind it a bit now; I cries,\\nbecause he goes on flogging till you do, and it\\'s no use having more\\nthan you can help.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t deserve it,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not necessary; you\\'ll get it, as we all do, whether you deserve\\nit or not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try to deserve it in future,\" replied I, clenching my fist;\\n\"I\\'ll be even with him.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what can you do?\"\\n\\n\"Wait a little, and you\\'ll see,\" said I, walking away, for an idea had\\ncome into my head which I wished to follow up.\\n\\nSoon afterwards the bell rang, and we returned to the schoolroom.  I was\\nput under the tuition of another boy, and took care to learn my lesson.\\nWhether it was that he was tired with the exercise, for he flogged and\\nferruled a dozen during that afternoon, or that he thought that my\\nmorning dose had been sufficient, I received no more punishment on that\\nday.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\\n\\nAs soon as school was dismissed, I went straight to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him how I had been treated.  As soon as he heard it,\\nhe exclaimed, \"This is really too bad; I will go with you, and I will\\nconsult with your aunt Amelia.\"\\n\\nIt so happened that aunt Milly was alone in the shop when we arrived,\\nand after a detail of what had passed, she told Captain Bridgeman that\\nmy grandmother had put me to that school out of feelings of ill-will for\\nthe tricks I had played, and had threatened that if I were removed she\\nwould leave Chatham and take her away with her.  My mother required\\nassistance in the shop, and was afraid to affront my grandmother, who\\nwas a very dictatorial, positive old woman, and would certainly keep her\\nresolution; but that rather than I should be treated in such a barbarous\\nmanner she would insist upon my mother taking me away, or would herself\\nleave the place.\\n\\n\"It would never do for you to leave us, Miss Amelia,\" replied Captain\\nBridgeman, \"there are but few attractions in this place, and we cannot\\nspare you; the whole corps would go into deep mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to leave the school,\" interrupted I; \"I would not leave it\\ntill I am revenged, for all the world.  Now, I\\'ll tell you what I want\\nto do--and do it I will, if he cuts me to pieces.  He eats my\\nsandwiches, and tells me if there\\'s not more mustard to-morrow, he\\'ll\\nflog me.  He shall have plenty of mustard, but he shall have something\\nelse.  What can I put into the sandwiches, so as to half kill him?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, my little Percival,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"I\\'ll just\\nask the doctor how much calomel a man may take without a coroner\\'s\\ninquest being required.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that will do nicely,\" said my aunt; \"I\\'ll take care he shall have\\nmustard enough not to perceive it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll go to the barracks and be back directly,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman.\\n\\n\"And I\\'m ready for the flogging as soon as the sandwiches are down his\\nthroat,\" replied I, laughing, \"I don\\'t care a fig for it.\"\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman soon returned with forty grains of calomel, which he\\ndelivered into aunt Milly\\'s hands.  \"That is as much as we dare give the\\nstrongest man without running great danger; we\\'ll try the effect of that\\nupon him, and if he don\\'t improve, I think I shall go up to the school\\nmyself and threaten him.\"\\n\\n\"As for that,\" replied aunt Milly, \"I\\'m sure that sister, if she hears\\nwhat\\'s going on, as she cannot take Percival away, will order her\\nhusband, Ben, to go up and thrash him.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, Miss Amelia, we\\'ll try that if we find it necessary; at\\nall events, we\\'ll see who can persecute most.\"\\n\\n\"Granny has told him to treat me ill,\" said I, \"that\\'s very clear, from\\nwhat he said; never mind, I\\'ll make her sorry for it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Percival! you must not do anything to granny,\" said aunt Milly,\\nlooking very archly; \"I must not hear anything of the kind.\"\\n\\nThe next morning I set off with a full conviction that I should be\\nflogged before night, and notwithstanding that, as full of joy as if I\\nwas going to the fair.\\n\\nThe morning passed as usual; I said my lesson, but not very well; I was\\nthinking so much of my anticipated revenge, that I could not pay\\nattention to my teacher, who was, as usual, one of the boys.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"we\\'ll let the account stand over\\ntill the evening, and then I\\'ll give you a receipt in full; I may have\\none or two lines to add to it before the sun goes down; you\\'ll not\\nescape me this time, anyhow.\"\\n\\nThe boys went out at the dinner hour, leaving me, as before, to wait for\\nmy basket, after the tyrant had helped himself.  I stood by him in\\nsilence while he was rummaging its contents.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene, I\\'ll see if you\\'ve remembered my particular injunction\\nrelative to the mustard.\"\\n\\n\"I told my aunt to put more mustard, sir,\" replied I, humbly, \"it she\\nthat cuts the sandwiches.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, if your aunt has not complied with your request, see if I\\ndon\\'t flay you alive, you little imp of abomination.\"\\n\\nThe sandwiches were pulled out of the paper and tasted.  \"Down on your\\nknees, Mr Keene, and thank all the blessed saints that your aunt has\\nsaved you from at least one-half of what I intended to administer to you\\nthis blessed afternoon, for she has doubled the mustard, you tief,\" said\\nMr O\\'Gallagher, speaking with his mouth as full as it could hold.  Down\\nwent sandwich after sandwich, until they had all disappeared.  Oh! what\\njoy was mine!  I could have tossed up my cap and leapt in the air.\\nHaving received the bread and cheese, for he permitted me to have the\\nlatter on this occasion I went out and enjoyed my meal, delighted with\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s having fallen into the trap I had laid for him.\\n\\nThe bell summoned us in, and all went on as usual for the first two\\nhours, when I thought Mr O\\'Gallagher changed countenance and looked\\nvery pale.  He continued, however, to hear the lessons, until at last I\\nperceived him pass his hand up and down and across his stomach, as if he\\nhad had a twinge; a few minutes afterwards, he compressed his thick\\nlips, and then put his hands to his abdomen.\\n\\n\"Ah! he begins to feel it now,\" thought I; and sure enough he did; for\\nthe pain increased so rapidly that he lost all patience, and vented his\\nfeelings by beating with his ruler, on the heads of the whole class of\\nboys standing up before him, till one or two dropped down, stunned with\\nthe blows.  At last he dropped the ruler, and, pressing both hands to\\nhis stomach, he rolled himself backwards and forwards, and then twisted\\nand distorted his legs till he could bear the pain no longer; and he\\ngave vent to a tremendous Irish howl--grinning and grinding his teeth\\nfor a few seconds, and then howling again, writhing and twisting in\\nevident agony--while the perspiration ran off his forehead.\\n\\n\"Och! murder!  I\\'m poisoned sure.  Lord save my sinful soul!  Oh--oh--\\noh! eh--eh--eh! mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy!  Oh holy St. Patrick!\\nI\\'m kilt entirely:\"--and so subdued was he at last by the pain, that he\\nburst out into a flood of tears, crying and roaring like a child.\\n\\nAgain the paroxysms came on--\"Murder, murder, murder!\" shrieked the\\nwretch at the highest pitch of his voice, so that he was heard at some\\ndistance, and some of the neighbours came in to inquire what was the\\nmatter.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher was now in a fainting state, and leaning against the\\ntable, he could merely say in a low voice, \"A doctor--quick--a doctor.\"\\n\\nThe neighbours perceiving how ill he was, led him out of the\\nschool-rooms into his own apartment, one going for a doctor, and the\\nothers telling the boys they might all go home, a notice of which they\\ngladly availed themselves.\\n\\nI need hardly say, that I made all the haste I could to communicate the\\nsuccessful result of my trick to Milly and Captain Bridgeman.  The\\nmedical man who was summoned, gave Mr O\\'Gallagher some very active\\nmedicine, which assisted to rid him of the calomel; of his having taken\\nwhich, of course, the medical man was ignorant.  The violence of the\\ndose was, however, so great, and left him in such a state, that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher could not leave his room for three days, nor resume his seat\\nin the school until a week had elapsed, during which I remained at home\\nplotting still further mischief.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher resumed his occupations, and I was again sent off to\\nschool.  When I entered the school-room I found him looking very pale\\nand cadaverous; as soon as he saw me his lips were drawn apart, and he\\nshowed his large white teeth, reminding me of the grinning of a hyena;\\nhe did not, however, say anything to me.  My studies were resumed; I\\nsaid my lesson perfectly, but was fully prepared for punishment.  I was,\\nhowever, agreeably disappointed; he did not punish either me or any of\\nthe other boys.\\n\\nI afterwards found out the reason was, that, although necessity\\ncompelled him to re-open his school as soon as he could, he was too weak\\nto undergo the fatigue of following up his favourite diversion.\\n\\nWhen the dinner-hour arrived, and the boys were dismissed, I waited\\npatiently to see what he would do with my basket, which stood beside\\nhim.  \"Take your basket, and eat your dinner, Master Keene,\" said he,\\nwalking out of the school-room into his own apartments.  I could not\\nhelp saying, \"Won\\'t you have the sandwiches, sir?\"\\n\\nHe turned round and gave me a look so penetrating and so diabolical,\\nthat I felt sure that he knew to whom he had been indebted for his late\\nsevere illness.\\n\\nFrom this day forward Mr O\\'G never interfered with the contents of my\\nbasket and I had my dinner all to myself.  The shock which had been\\ngiven to his constitution was so great, that for three or four months he\\nmay be said to have crawled to his school room, and I really began to\\nthink that the affair would turn out more serious than was intended; but\\ngradually he regained his strength, and as he recovered his vigour, so\\ndid he resume his severity.\\n\\nBut I was a great gainer during the three or four months of quiet which\\nreigned during Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s convalescence.  Since I have been grown\\nup, I have often thought, and am indeed confirmed in my opinion, that we\\nlose rather than gain by being educated at too early an age.  Commence\\nwith one child at three years, and with another at seven years old, and\\nin ten years, the one whose brain was left fallow even till seven years\\nold, will be quite as far, if not further advanced, than the child whose\\nintellect was prematurely forced at the earlier age; this is a fact\\nwhich I have since seen proved in many instances, and it certainly was\\ncorroborated in mine.\\n\\nIn six months I could read and write very fairly, and had commenced\\narithmetic; true, I was stimulated on by the advice of Captain\\nBridgeman, the love I bore my aunt Milly, and the hatred which I had for\\nmy master, which made me resolve that I would not deserve punishment on\\nthat score.\\n\\nIt was in May that I administered the dose to Mr O\\'Gallagher; in\\nSeptember he was quite well again, and the ruler, the ferrule, and the\\nrod, were triumphantly at work.  It is useless to say how often I was\\npunished, for it was every day; always once, sometimes twice; I became\\ncompletely callous to it, nay, laughed at it, but my mind was ever at\\nwork upon some mischief, in the way of retaliation.\\n\\nI put little pancakes of cobblers\\' wax on Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, and\\nhe had the pleasure of finding himself stuck fast by the breeches when\\nhe rose up to punish.  I anointed the handle of the ferrule and rod with\\nbird-lime; put dead cats under the claret cases, which composed his seat\\nof authority, so that the smell would drive him distracted before he\\nfound it out.  I drew up with a squirt, all the ink which was in the\\ninkstands fixed in the writing-desks, so as not to be taken out of the\\nsockets, and made good the deficiency with water, which put him to no\\nlittle expense.\\n\\nI once made him almost frantic, by rubbing his handkerchief which always\\nlaid by his side, and with which he was accustomed to wipe his face\\nevery five minutes (for he was profuse in his perspiration), with what\\nis called cow-itch: not being aware of what was the cause, he wiped his\\nface more and more, until he was as red as a peony, and the itching\\nbecame intolerable.\\n\\nOn such occasions he never inquired who was the party, but called me and\\nPhil Mooney.  I, on the other hand, never said a word in way of\\nexpostulation.  I took my flogging, which was as severe as he could give\\nit, as a matter of course, quite satisfied with the exchange.\\n\\nAs Walter Puddock had told me, and, as I have no doubt, the Eton boys\\nwill confirm, after a certain quantity of flagellations, the skin\\nbecomes so hard as to make the punishment almost a matter of\\nindifference and so I found it.  So passed the time until the month of\\nNovember, when I was fully enabled to pay off my worthy pedagogue for\\nall that I was indebted to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\\n\\nThe boys had been saving up all their money to purchase fireworks for\\nthe celebrated 5th of November--a day on which it was said that certain\\npersons, finding it impossible to reform the Lords and Commons, had\\ndetermined to get rid of them at once: why they have not been in similar\\ndanger every year since the first attempt was made, I know not; certain\\nit is, that it is the only reform measure that can ever be effectual.\\nGuy Fawkes and his confederates, whether Popish or Protestant, from the\\ndisregard of human life, certainly proved themselves the founders of a\\nparty, still existing, whose motto is, \"Measures and not Men.\"\\n\\nBut to proceed: Mr O\\'Gallagher had never before attempted to interfere\\nwith the vested rights of urchins on that day; being, however, in a most\\nparticular irascible humour, instead of a whole, he made it known that\\nthere would only be a half, holiday, and we were consequently all called\\nin for morning lessons instead of carrying about, as we had intended,\\nthe effigy of the only true reformer that ever existed in this country.\\n\\nThis made us all very sulky and discontented in the first place, and our\\nanxiety to get out of school was so great, that the lessons were not\\nvery perfect in the second.  The ferrule and rod were called out and\\nliberally administered; but what was our horror and dismay when Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, about an hour before dinner, announced to us that all the\\nsquibs and crackers, with which our pockets were crammed, were to be\\ngiven up immediately; and that, as we had not said our lessons well,\\nthere would be no half-holiday, the whole school were in mute despair.\\n\\nOne by one were the boys summoned up to the throne of Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\nand their pockets searched by Phil Mooney, who emptied them of their\\npyrotechnical contents, all of which were deposited on the dais of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, which, I have before observed, was composed of two\\nempty claret cases turned upside down, surmounted by another, on which\\nMr O\\'Gallagher sat, all three covered with old green baize.\\n\\nBy the time that the whole school had been rifled, the heap of fireworks\\nwas very considerable, and Mr O\\'Gallagher, to prevent any of them being\\nrecovered by the boys, lifted up the claret case on which he sat, and\\nwhich was on the top of the other two, and desired Phil Mooney to put\\nthem all underneath it.  This was done; Mr O\\'Gallagher resumed his\\nseat, and the lessons continued till the dinner hour arrived, but, alas!\\nnot the half-holiday or the fireworks.\\n\\nThe boys went out; some mournful, some angry, some sulky, some\\nfrightened; a few, a very few, declaiming against such injustice.\\n\\nI was in a rage; my blood boiled; at last my invention came to my aid,\\nand, without considering the consequences, I determined how to act.\\n\\nAs it was an hour and a half before school would commence, I hastened\\nhome, and, having spent all my money, begged aunt Milly to give me some;\\nshe gave me a shilling, and with that I bought as much gunpowder as I\\ncould procure, more than a quarter of a pound.\\n\\nI then returned to the school, looked into the school-room, and found it\\nempty; I quickly raised up the claret case, under which the fireworks\\nhad been placed, put the powder under it, leaving only sufficient for a\\nvery small train, which would not be perceived in the green baize\\ncovering; having so done, I left the school-room immediately, and\\nrejoined my companions.  I had a piece of touch-wood, as all the boys\\nhad, to let off their fireworks with, and this I lighted and left in a\\ncorner until the bell should summons us into school.\\n\\nOh! how my heart beat when I heard the sound, so full was I of anxiety\\nlest my project should fail.\\n\\nOnce more we were all assembled.  Mr O\\'Gallagher surveying, with the\\nsmile of a demon, the unhappy and disappointed faces of the boys, was\\nagain perched upon his throne, the rod on one side, the ferrule on the\\nother, and the ruler, that dreaded truncheon of command, clenched in his\\nbroad fist.\\n\\nI had the touchwood lighted and concealed in my hand; gradually I moved\\ndownwards, until at last, unperceived by Mr O\\'Gallagher, I was behind\\nhim, and close to my train of gunpowder.  I gave one look to ascertain\\nif he had observed me; his eye was roving over the school for some\\ndelinquent to throw his ruler at; fearful that he might turn round to\\nme, I no longer hesitated, and the touchwood was applied to the train.\\n\\nIgnorant as I was of the force of gunpowder, it was with astonishment,\\nmingled with horror, that I beheld, in a second, the claret case rise up\\nas if it had wings, and Mr O\\'Gallagher thrown up to the ceiling\\nenveloped in a cloud of smoke, the crackers and squibs fizzing and\\nbanging, while the boys in the school uttered a yell of consternation\\nand fear as they rushed from from the explosion, and afterwards,\\ntumbling over one another, made their escape from the school-room.\\n\\nThe windows had all been blown out with a terrible crash, and the whole\\nschool-room was now covered by the smoke.  There I stood in silent\\ndismay at the mischief which I had done.  The squibs and crackers had\\nnot, however, all finished popping, before I heard the howling of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, who had fallen down upon the centre school-room table.\\n\\nI was still in the school-room, half-suffocated, yet not moving away\\nfrom where I stood, when the neighbours, who had been alarmed by the\\nexplosion and the cries of the boys, rushed in, and perceiving only me\\nand Mr O\\'Gallagher, who still howled, they caught hold of us both, and\\nbore us out in their arms.  It was high time, for the school-room was\\nnow on fire, and in a few minutes more the flames burst out of the\\nwindows, while volumes of smoke forced through the door and soon\\nafterwards the roof.\\n\\nThe engines were sent for, but before they could arrive, or water be\\nprocured, the whole tenement was so enveloped in flames that it could\\nnot be saved.  In an hour, the _locale_ of our misery was reduced to\\nashes.  They had put me on my legs as soon as we got clear of the\\nschool-room, to ascertain whether I was hurt, and finding that I was\\nnot, they left me.\\n\\nI never shall forget what my sensations were, when I beheld the flames\\nand volumes of smoke bursting out; the hurry, and bustle, and confusion\\noutside; the working of the engines, the troops marched up from the\\nbarracks, the crowd of people assembled, and the ceaseless mingling of\\ntongues from every quarter; and all this is my doing, thought I--mine--\\nall mine.\\n\\nI felt delighted that I had no partner or confederate; I could, at all\\nevents, keep my own secret.  I did, however, feel some anxiety as to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, for, much as I detested him, I certainly had no intention\\nto kill him; so after a time, I made inquiries, and found that he was\\nalive: and in no danger, although very much bruised and somewhat burnt.\\n\\nNo one could explain how the catastrophe occurred, further than that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had collected all the squibs and crackers from the boys, and\\nthat they had exploded somehow or another--most people said that it\\nserved him right.  My grandmother shook her head and said, \"Yes, yes,\\ngunpowder will go off, but--\" and she looked at me--\"it requires a match\\nto be put to it.\"  I looked up very innocently, but made no reply.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s favourite expression, to wit, \"that it would end in a\\nblow-up,\" proved, as far as his school was concerned, literally true.\\nHe had not the means of procuring another suitable tenement in Chatham,\\nand as soon as he had recovered from the injuries he had received, he\\nquitted the town.\\n\\nIt was not until he had left, that I ventured to make known to Captain\\nBridgeman, and my aunt Milly, the trifling share I had in the\\ntransaction; and they, perceiving the prudence of keeping my secret,\\ndesired me on no account to let it be known to any one else.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE.\\n\\nAs soon as it was ascertained that Mr O\\'Gallagher was gone, my\\ngrandmother insisted upon my being sent to another school, and on this\\noccasion my mother made the inquiries herself, and I was despatched to\\none much nearer home, and being treated well, not only played fewer\\ntricks, but advanced rapidly in my education; so rapidly indeed, that my\\ngrandmother began to think that I was not so bad a boy as I used to be.\\n\\nAs she treated me more kindly, I felt less inclined to teaze her\\nalthough the spirit of mischief was as undiminished as ever, and was\\nshown in various ways.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that out of the many admirers of my aunt\\nMilly, there were only two who appeared to be at all constant in their\\nattention.  One was Lieutenant Flat, who was positively smitten, and\\nwould have laid his pay and person at her feet, had he received anything\\nlike encouragement; but my aunt disliked him in the first place, and,\\nmoreover, had a very strong feeling towards Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nMr Flat was certainly a very fine-looking soldier, being tall, erect,\\nand well-made, but he was at the same time not over-brilliant; he was,\\nas an officer, the very sort of person my father Ben was as a private.\\n\\nBut the other party, Captain Bridgeman, did not come forward; he\\nappeared to be in doubt, and not at all able to make up his mind.\\n\\nThe fact was, that my mother being married to a private, made any match\\nwith the sister objectionable to the whole corps, as it would be\\nderogatory that one sister should be the wife of a private, and the\\nother of an officer.  Ben would have been able to say, \"My\\nbrother-in-law, the captain of my division,\" which would never have\\ndone; and this Captain Bridgeman felt, and therefore resisted, as well\\nas he could, the inroads which my aunt\\'s beauty and mirth had made into\\nhis heart.  My aunt was exactly a person to suit Captain Bridgeman as a\\nhelpmate, had it not been for this unfortunate alliance of my mother\\'s.\\n\\nLieutenant Flat was too stupid and indifferent to the opinion of the\\nother officers, to care anything about what they thought; he would have\\nmarried Milly long before, but my aunt, who had made up her mind to\\nmarry an officer, did not yet despair of obtaining the captain; and\\nalthough she would not positively dismiss Lieutenant Flat, she merely\\nkept him as a sort of reserve, to fall back upon when every other chance\\nwas gone.\\n\\nI should like, if I possibly could, to give the reader some idea of my\\nmother\\'s circulating-library and sort of universal commodity shop: it\\nwas a low-windowed building, one story high, but running a long way\\nback, where it was joined to a small parlour, in which we generally sat\\nduring the day, as it was convenient in case of company or customers,\\nthe little parlour having a glass door, which permitted us to look into\\nthe shop.\\n\\nIn the front windows, on one side, were all the varieties of tapers,\\nsealing-wax, inkstands, and every kind of stationery, backed by\\nchildren\\'s books, leather writing-cases, prints, caricatures, and\\nTonbridge ware.  In the other windows were ribbons, caps, gloves,\\nscarfs, needles, and other little articles in demand by ladies, and\\nwhich they required independent of their milliners.\\n\\nAt the entrance were sticks and canes; on the counter a case of gold and\\nmore moderate-priced trinkets.  On the shelves of the millinery side\\nwere boxes of gloves, ribbons, buttons, etcetera.  On the opposite side,\\nperfumes, cigars, toothbrushes, combs, scented soaps, and other\\nrequisites for the toilet.\\n\\nAbout ten feet on each side of the shop was occupied with the above\\narticles; the remainder of the shelves were reserved for the\\ncirculating-library.\\n\\nAt the back of the shop were some seats round a small table, on which\\nwas laid the newspaper of the day, and on each side of the parlour-door\\nwere hoops, bats, balls, traps, skittles, and a variety of toys for\\nchildren.\\n\\nMy mother usually attended to the millinery, and my aunt Milly to what\\nmight be termed the gentlemen\\'s side of the shop; the remainder of the\\ngoods and circulating-library were in the hands of both.\\n\\nThere were few hours of the day in which the chairs at the counter and\\nround the table were not taken possession of by some one or another,\\neither reading the paper or a book, or talking, to pass away the time.\\nIn fact, it was a sort of rendezvous, where all who met knew each other,\\nand where the idle of our own sex used to repair to get rid of their\\ntime.  Captain Bridgeman and Mr Flat were certainly the two most\\nconstantly to be found there, although few of the marine officers were a\\nday without paying us a visit.\\n\\nSuch was the _locale_; to describe the company will be more difficult,\\nbut I will attempt it.\\n\\nMy mother, remarkably nicely dressed, is busy opening a parcel of new\\nbooks just arrived.  My aunt Milly behind the counter, on the\\ngentlemen\\'s side, pretending to be working upon a piece of muslin about\\nfive inches square.  Mr Flat sitting near the table, fallen back in his\\nchair, apparently watching the flies on the ceiling.  Captain Bridgeman,\\na very good-looking man, very slight, but extremely active, is sitting\\nat the counter opposite to where my aunt is standing, a small black\\ncane, with a silver head to it, in his hand, and his gloves peculiarly\\nclean and well-fitting.  He has an eye as sharp as an eagle\\'s, a slight\\nhook to his nose, thin lips, and very white teeth; his countenance is as\\nfull of energy and fire as that of lieutenant Flat is heavy and\\nunmeaning.\\n\\n\"Miss Amelia, if I may take the liberty,\" said Captain Bridgeman,\\npointing with his cane to the bit of muslin she is employed upon; \"what\\nare you making? it\\'s too small for any part of a lady\\'s dress.\"\\n\\n\"It is quite large enough for a cuff, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"A cuff; then you are making a cuff, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed she is not, Captain Bridgeman,\" replies my mother; \"it is only\\nto keep herself out of mischief.  She spoils a bit like that every week.\\nAnd that\\'s why it is so small, Captain Bridgeman; it would be a pity to\\nspoil a larger piece.\"\\n\\n\"I really was not aware that such a mere trifle would keep you out of\\nmischief,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"You know,\" replied Aunt Milly, \"that idleness is the root of all evil,\\nCaptain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Flat, do you hear that?\" says Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"What?\" replies Flat.\\n\\n\"That idleness is the root of all evil; what an evil-disposed person you\\nmust be.\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking,\" replied Flat.\\n\\n\"I suspect it\\'s only lately you\\'ve taken to that.  Who or what were you\\nthinking about?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I believe I was thinking how long it would be before dinner was\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very rude, Mr Flat; you might have said that you were thinking\\nabout me,\" replied my aunt.\\n\\n\"Well, so I was at first, and then I began to think of dinner-time.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be offended, Miss Amelia; Flat pays you a great compliment in\\ndividing his attentions; but I really wish to know why ladies will spoil\\nmuslin in such a predetermined manner.  Will you explain that, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Captain Bridgeman: a piece of work is very valuable to a woman,\\nespecially when she finds herself in company with gentlemen like you.\\nIt saves her from looking down, or looking at you, when you are talking\\nnonsense; it prevents your reading in her eyes what is passing in her\\nmind, or discovering what effect your words may have upon her; it saves\\nmuch awkwardness, and very often a blush; sometimes a woman hardly knows\\nwhich way to look; sometimes she may look any way but the right.  Now a\\nbit of muslin with a needle is a remedy for all that, for she can look\\ndown at her work, and not look up till she thinks it advisable.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for your explanation, madam; I shall always take it as a\\ngreat compliment if I see a lady very busy at work when I\\'m conversing,\\nwith her.\"\\n\\n\"But you may flatter yourself, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied my mother;\\n\"the attention to her work may arise from perfect indifference, or from\\npositive annoyance.  It saves the trouble of making an effort to be\\npolite.\"\\n\\n\"And pray, may I inquire, Miss Amelia, what feeling may cause your\\nparticular attention to your work at this present moment?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps in either case to preserve my self-possession,\" replied Amelia;\\n\"or perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, I may prefer looking at a piece of\\nmuslin to looking at a marine officer.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not very flattering,\" replied the captain; \"if you spoil the\\nmuslin, you\\'re determined not to spoil me.\"\\n\\n\"The muslin is of little value,\" said Amelia, softly, walking to the\\nother side of the shop, and turning over the books.\\n\\n\"Mr Flat,\" said my mother, \"your subscription to the library is out\\nlast month; I presume I can put your name down again?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know; I never read a book,\" replied Mr Flat, yawning.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not at all necessary, Mr Flat,\" said my mother; \"in most\\nbusinesses there are sleeping partners; besides, if you don\\'t read, you\\ncome here to talk, which is a greater enjoyment still, and luxuries must\\nbe paid for.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try another quarter,\" replied Mr Flat, \"and then--\"\\n\\n\"And then what?\" said my aunt Milly, smiling.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" says Flat.  \"Is that clock of yours right, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"It is; but I am fearful that your thoughts run faster than the clock,\\nMr Flat; you are thinking of the dress-bugle for dinner.\"\\n\\n\"No, I was not.\"\\n\\n\"Then you were thinking of yourself?\"\\n\\n\"No, I wasn\\'t, Mrs Keene,\" said Flat, rising, and walking out of the\\nshop.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" said he, turning round as he went out, \"what I was\\nthinking of, Mrs Keene; not of myself,--I was thinking of my bull pup.\"\\n\\nMy mother burst out a laughing as the lieutenant disappeared.  \"I was\\nnot far wrong when I said he was thinking of himself,\" said she, \"for a\\n_calf_ is a sort of _bull pup_.\"\\n\\nAt this sally Captain Bridgeman laughed, and danced about the shop; at\\nlast he said, \"Poor Flat!  Miss Amelia, he\\'s desperately in love with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s more than I am with him,\" said Amelia, calmly.\\n\\nHere two ladies came in.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman made a most polite bow.  \"I trust Mrs Handbell is\\nquite well and Miss Handbell--I hardly need ask the question with the\\ncharming colour you have?\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman, you appear to live in this library; I wonder Mrs\\nKeene don\\'t take you into partnership.\"\\n\\n\"If I were not honoured with the custom of Mrs Handbell and other\\nladies; I fear that my shop would have little attraction for gentlemen,\"\\nreplied my mother, with a courtesy.\\n\\n\"Mrs Keene is quite correct in her surmise, Miss Handbell,\" said\\nCaptain Bridgeman, \"now that I have seen you, I shall not think my\\nmorning thrown away.\"\\n\\n\"If report says true, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied Mrs Handbell, \"you\\nwould be quite as often here, even if no ladies were to be customers of\\nMrs Keene.  Mrs Keene, have you any of that narrow French ribbon\\nleft?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have, madam; it was off this piece, was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but I really don\\'t know exactly how much I require; perhaps you\\nwill measure it and allow me to return what is left?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, madam; will you take it with you, or shall I send it?\"\\n\\n\"I wish for it directly; will you be very long in measuring it, for I\\nought to be home now?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you\\'ll have the kindness to measure what you take off yourself,\\nmadam,\" replied my mother, \"and then you need not wait.\"\\n\\n\"You put confidence in me, I observe, Mrs Keene,\" replied Mrs\\nHandbell; \"well, I will do you justice.\"\\n\\nMy mother smiled most graciously, put the piece of ribbon in paper, and\\nhanded it to Mrs Handbell, who, bowing to Captain Bridgeman, quitted\\nthe shop.\\n\\n\"I wonder whether you would trust me in that way?\" said Captain\\nBridgeman to my mother.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I should; Amelia says you will help yourself to cigars\\nand that she is sure you cheat when you count them.\"\\n\\n\"Does she really say that?  Well, I did think that if there was any one\\nwho would have upheld my character, it would have been Miss Amelia.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, she is getting tired of so doing.\"\\n\\n\"Or tired of me, Mrs Keene, which would be worse still.  Here comes a\\nfair young lady--Miss Evans, if I mistake not; I believe she is a good\\ncustomer to your library?\"\\n\\n\"She reads a great deal, and is therefore only a customer to the\\nlibrary.\"\\n\\n\"Ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning Miss Evans,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"you come for more\\nfood for the mind, I presume?\"  (Miss Evans gave a bob, and turned to my\\nmother.)\\n\\n\"Have you anything new, Mrs Keene?  I have brought back the three\\nvolumes of Godolphin.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, I have some books down to-day.\"\\n\\nWhile Miss Evans was selecting from the new books, enter Mr Jones, Mr\\nSmith, and Mr Claville, of the marine corps, for cigars.  Amelia comes\\nout to attend them--they purchase a few articles, and are talking very\\nloud, when three more ladies enter the shop, all for books.\\n\\nIt being now about three o\\'clock, the customers and loungers come in\\nfast.  Captain Bridgeman saunters away in company with his brother\\nofficers; other parties enter, who are succeeded by fresh claimants for\\nbooks or the other articles to be procured in the repository.\\n\\nThis demand continues till about five o\\'clock, when the library becomes\\nempty; I come home from school, my father slinks in from barracks, and\\nmy mother and sister return to the back parlour, where they find my\\ngrandmother, as usual, very busy with her knitting.\\n\\nSuch is a fair sample of what took place at our shop every succeeding\\nday.  My mother made few bad debts, and rapidly added to her savings.\\nMy aunt Milly still balancing between the certainty of Lieutenant Flat\\nand the chance of Captain Bridgeman, and I dividing my time and talents\\nbetween learning and contriving mischief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN.\\n\\nAbout six months after I had blown up the school of Mr O\\'Gallagher, the\\ncompany to which my father Ben belonged was ordered afloat again, and\\nshortly afterwards sailed for the East Indies, in the Redoubtable, 74.\\nThat my mother was very much pleased at his departure, I do not scruple\\nto assert; but whether she ever analysed her feelings, I cannot pretend\\nto say; I rather think that all she wished was, that the chapter of\\naccidents would prevent Ben\\'s reappearance, as she was ashamed of him as\\na husband, and felt that he was an obstacle to her sister\\'s advancement.\\n\\nSo one fine day Ben wished us all good bye; my mother was very generous\\nto him, as she could well afford to be.  I rather think that Ben himself\\nwas not sorry to go, for, stupid as he was, he must have felt what a\\ncypher he had become, being treated, not only by my mother, but by\\neverybody else, even by me, as a sort of upper servant.\\n\\nIt so happened, that about a month after Ben\\'s departure, Captain Delmar\\nhad, through the interest of his uncle, Lord de Versely, been appointed\\nto a ship which was lying in the Medway, and he came down to Chatham to\\njoin her.  He had no idea that my mother was there, for he had lost\\nsight of her altogether, and had it not been for me, might very probably\\nhave left the town without having made the discovery.\\n\\nAmong other amusements, I had a great partiality for a certain bull pup,\\nmentioned by Lieutenant Flat in the former chapter, and which he had\\nmade me a present of; the pup was now grown up, and I had taught it many\\ntricks; but the one which afforded me most amusement (of course, at\\nother people\\'s expense) was, that I had made out of oakum a sham\\npigtail, about a foot and a half long, very strong and think, with an\\niron hook at the upper end of it.\\n\\nThe sham tail I could easily hook on to the collar of any one\\'s coat\\nfrom behind, without their perceiving it; and Bob had been instructed by\\nme, whenever I told him to fetch it (and not before), to jump up at the\\ntail wherever it might be, and hang on to it with all the tenacity of\\nthe race.\\n\\nAs it may be supposed, this was a great source of mirth in the barracks;\\nit was considered a good joke, and was much applauded by Captain\\nBridgeman; but it was not considered a good joke out of the barracks;\\nand many an old woman had I already frightened almost out of her senses,\\nby affixing the tail to any portion of the back part of her dress.\\n\\nIt so happened, that one afternoon, as I was cruising about with Bob at\\nmy heels, I perceived the newly-arrived Captain Delmar, in all the pomp\\nof pride of full uniform, parading down the street with a little middy\\nat his heels; and I thought to myself, \"Law! how I should like to hang\\nmy tail to his fine coat, if I only dared;\" the impulse had become so\\nstrong, that I actually had pulled up my pinafore and disengaged the\\ntail ready for any opportunity, but I was afraid that the middy would\\nsee me.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had passed close to me, the middy at his heels was\\npassing, and I thought all chance was gone, when, suddenly, Captain\\nDelmar turned short round and addressed the little officer, asking him\\nwhether he had brought the order-book with him?  The middy touched his\\nhat, and said, \"No;\" upon which Captain Delmar began to inflict a most\\nserious lecture upon the lad for forgetting what he had forgotten\\nhimself, and I again passed by.\\n\\nThis was an opportunity I could not resist; while the captain and middy\\nwere so well employed giving and receiving I fixed my oakum tail to the\\ncollar of the Captain\\'s gold-laced coat, and then walked over to the\\nother side of the street with Bob at my heels.\\n\\nThe middy being duly admonished, Captain Delmar turned round again and\\nresumed his way; upon which I called Bob, who was quite as ready for the\\nfun as I was, and pointing to the captain, said, \"Fetch it, Bob.\"  My\\ncompanion cleared the street in three or four bounds, and in a few\\nseconds afterwards made a spring up the back of Captain Delmar, and\\nseizing the tail, hung by it with his teeth, shaking it with all his\\nmight as he hung in the air.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was, to use a sailor\\'s term, completely taken aback;\\nindeed he was nearly capsized by the unexpected assault.  For a short\\ntime he could not discover what it was; at last, by turning his head\\nover his shoulder and putting his hand behind him, he discovered who his\\nassailant was.\\n\\nJust at that time, I called out \"Mad dog! mad dog!\" and Captain Delmar,\\nhearing those alarming words, became dreadfully frightened; his cocked\\nhat dropped from his head, and he took to his heels as fast as he could,\\nrunning down the street, with Bob clinging behind him.\\n\\nThe first open door he perceived was that of my mother\\'s library; he\\nburst in, nearly upsetting Captain Bridgeman, who was seated at the\\ncounter, talking to Aunt Milly, crying out \"Help! help!\"  As he turned\\nround, his sword became entangled between his legs, tripped him up, and\\nhe fell on the floor.  This unhooked the tail, and Bob galloped out of\\nthe shop, bearing his prize to me, who, with the little middy, remained\\nin the street convulsed with laughter.  Bob delivered up the tail, which\\nI again concealed under my pinafore, and then with a demure face\\nventured to walk towards my mother\\'s house, and, going in at the back\\ndoor, put Master Bob in the wash-house out of the way; the little middy\\nwho had picked up the captain\\'s hat, giving me a wink as I passed him,\\nas much as to say, I won\\'t inform against you.\\n\\nIn the meantime Captain Delmar had been assisted to his legs by Captain\\nBridgeman, who well knew who had played the trick, and who, as well as\\nAunt Milly, had great difficulty in controlling his mirth.\\n\\n\"Merciful heaven! what was it?  Was the animal mad?  Has it bitten me?\"\\nexclaimed Captain Delmar, falling back in his chair, in which he had\\nbeen seated by Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"I really do not know,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"but you are not\\nhurt, sir, apparently, nor indeed is your coat torn.\"\\n\\n\"What dog--whose dog can it be?--it must be shot immediately--I shall\\ngive orders--I shall report the case to the admiral.  May I ask for a\\nglass of water?  Oh, Mr Dott! you\\'re there, sir; how came you to allow\\nthat dog to fasten himself on my back in that way?\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" said the middy, presenting his cocked hat to the\\ncaptain, \"I did draw my dirk to kill him, but you ran away so fast that\\nI couldn\\'t catch you.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir, you may go down to the boat and wait for orders,\"\\nreplied the captain.\\n\\nAt this moment my mother, who had been dressing herself, made her first\\nappearance, coming out of the back parlour with a glass of water, which\\naunt Milly had gone in for.  Perceiving a gold-laced captain, she\\nadvanced all smiles and courtesies, until she looked in his face, and\\nthen she gave a scream, and dropped the tumbler on the floor, much to\\nthe surprise of Captain Bridgeman, and also of aunt Milly, who, not\\nhaving been at the Hall, was not acquainted with the person of Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nJust at this moment in came I, looking as demure as if, as the saying\\nis, \"butter would not melt in my mouth,\" and certainly as much\\nastonished as the rest at my mother\\'s embarrassment; but she soon\\nrecovered herself, and asked Captain Delmar if he would condescend to\\nrepose himself a little in the back parlour.  When my mother let the\\ntumbler fall, the captain had looked her full in the face and recognised\\nher, and, in a low voice, said, \"Excessively strange,--so very\\nunexpected!\"  He then rose up from the chair and followed my mother into\\nthe back room.\\n\\n\"Who can it be?\" said Aunt Milly to Captain Bridgeman, in a low tone.\\n\\n\"I suppose it must be the new captain appointed to the Calliope.  I read\\nhis name in the papers,--the Honourable Captain Delmar.\"\\n\\n\"It must be him,\" replied Milly; \"for my sister was brought up by his\\naunt, Mrs Delmar; no wonder she was surprised at meeting him so\\nsuddenly.  Percival, you naughty boy,\" continued Milly, shaking her\\nfinger at me, \"it was all your doing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Aunt Milly! you should have seen him run,\" replied I, laughing at\\nthe thought.\\n\\n\"I\\'d recommend you not to play with post captains,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman, \"or you may get worse than you give.  Mercy on us!\" exclaimed\\nhe, looking at me full in the face.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said aunt Milly.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman leant over the counter, and I heard him whisper, \"Did\\nyou ever see such a likeness as between the lad and Captain Delmar?\"\\n\\nMilly blushed a little, nodded her head, and smiled, as she turned away.\\nCaptain Bridgeman appeared to be afterwards in a brown study; he tapped\\nhis boot with his cane, and did not speak.\\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed, during which Captain Delmar remained\\nwith my mother in the parlour, when she opened the door, and beckoned me\\nto come in.  I did so not without some degree of anxiety, for I was\\nafraid that I had been discovered: but this doubt was soon removed;\\nCaptain Delmar did me the honour to shake hands with me, and then patted\\nmy head saying, he hoped I was a good boy, which, being compelled to be\\nmy own trumpeter, I very modestly declared that I was.  My mother, who\\nwas standing up behind, lifted up her eyes at my barefaced assertion.\\nCaptain Delmar then shook hands with my mother, intimating his intention\\nof paying her another visit very soon, and again patting me on the head,\\nquitted the parlour, and went away through the shop.\\n\\nAs soon as Captain Delmar was gone, my mother turned round, and said,\\n\"You naughty, mischievous boy, to play such pranks.  I\\'ll have that dog\\nkilled, without you promise me never to do so again.\"\\n\\n\"Do what again, mother?\"\\n\\n\"None of your pretended innocence with me.  I\\'ve been told of the\\npigtail that Bob pulls at.  That\\'s all very well at the barracks with\\nthe marines, sir, but do you know _who_ it is that you have been playing\\nthat trick to?\"\\n\\n\"No mother, I don\\'t.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"Who is he, you undutiful child? why, he\\'s--he\\'s the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what of that?\" replied I.  \"He\\'s a naval captain, ain\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but he\\'s the nephew of the lady who brought me up and educated me.\\nIt was he that made the match between me and our father: so if it had\\nnot been for him, child, you never would have been born.\"\\n\\n\"Oh that\\'s it,\" replied I.  \"Well, mother, if it had not been for me,\\nhe\\'d never have come into the shop, and found you.\"\\n\\n\"But, my child, we must be serious; you must be very respectful to\\nCaptain Delmar, and play no tricks with him; for you may see him very\\noften, and, perhaps, he will take a fancy to you; and if he does, he may\\ndo you a great deal of good, and bring you forward in the world; so\\npromise me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I\\'ll promise you I\\'ll leave him alone if you wish it.\\nLaw, mother, you should have seen how the middy laughed at him; it was\\nreal fun to make a gallant captain run in the way he did.\"\\n\\n\"Go along, you mischievous animal, and recollect your promise to me,\"\\nsaid my mother, as she went into the shop where she found that Captain\\nBridgeman, to whom she intended to explain how it was that she had\\ndropped the tumbler of water, had gone away.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of consultation between my grandmother and my\\nmother on that evening; my aunt and I were sent out to to take a walk,\\nthat we might not overhear what passed, and when we returned we found\\nthem still in close conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar was now a frequent visitor to my mother,\\nand a good customer to the library.  He did, however, generally contrive\\nthat his visit should be paid late in the afternoon, just after the\\nmarine officers had retired to dress for dinner; for he was a very\\nhaughty personage, and did not think it proper for any officers of an\\ninferior grade to come \"between the wind and his nobility.\"\\n\\nI cannot say that I was partial to him; indeed, his pomposity, as I\\nconsidered it, was to me a source of ridicule and dislike.  He took more\\nnotice of me than he did of anybody else; but he appeared to consider\\nthat his condescending patronage was all that was necessary; whereas,\\nhad he occasionally given me a half-crown I should have cherished better\\nfeelings towards him: not that I wanted money, for my mother supplied me\\nvery liberally, considering my age: but although you may coax and\\nflatter a girl into loving you, you cannot a boy, who requires more\\nsubstantial proofs of your good-will.\\n\\nThere were a great many remarks not very flattering to my mother, made\\nbehind her back, as to her former intimacy with Captain Delmar; for,\\nsomehow or another, there always is somebody who knows something,\\nwherever doubts or surmises arise, and so it was in this case; but if\\npeople indulged in ill-natured remarks when she was not there, they did\\nnot in her presence; on the contrary, the friendship of so great a man\\nas the Honourable Captain Delmar appeared rather to make my mother a\\nperson of more consequence.\\n\\nShe was continually pointing out to me the propriety of securing the\\ngood will of this great personage, and the more she did so, the more I\\nfelt inclined to do the reverse; indeed, I should have broke out into\\nopen mutiny, if it had not been for Captain Bridgeman, who sided with my\\nmother, and when I went to him to propose playing another trick upon the\\nnoble captain, not only refused to aid me, but told me, if I ever\\nthought of such a thing, he would never allow me to come to his rooms\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Why, what good can he do to me?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"He may advance you properly in life--who knows?--he may put you on the\\nquarter-deck, and get you promoted in the service.\"\\n\\n\"What, make a middy of me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and from a midshipman you may rise to be a post-captain, or\\nadmiral,--a much greater rank than I shall ever obtain,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman; \"so take my advice, and do as your mother wishes; be very\\ncivil and respectful to Captain Delmar, and he may be as good as a\\nfather to you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not saying much,\" replied I, thinking of my father Ben; \"I\\'d\\nrather have two mothers than two fathers.\"  And here the conversation\\nended.\\n\\nI had contracted a great alliance with Mr Dott, the midshipman, who\\nfollowed Captain Delmar about, just as Bob used to follow me, and\\ngenerally remained in the shop or outside with me, when his captain\\ncalled upon my mother.  He was a little wag, as full of mischief as\\nmyself, and even his awe of his captain, which, as a youngster in the\\nservice, was excessive, would not prevent him from occasionally breaking\\nout.  My mother took great notice of him, and when he could obtain leave\\n(which, indeed, she often asked for him), invited him to come to our\\nhouse, when he became my companion during his stay; we would sally out\\ntogether, and vie with each other in producing confusion and mirth at\\nother people\\'s expense; we became the abhorrence of every old\\nfruit-woman and beggar in the vicinity.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar heard occasionally of my pranks, and looked very majestic\\nand severe; but as I was not a middy, I cared little for his frowns.  At\\nlast an opportunity offered which I could not resist; and, not daring to\\nmake known my scheme either to Captain Bridgeman or Aunt Milly, I\\nconfided it to Tommy Dott, the little middy, who, regardless of the\\nconsequences, joined me in it heart and soul.\\n\\nThe theatre had been opened at Chatham, and had met with indifferent\\nsuccess.  I went there once with my aunt Milly, and twice with Mr Dott;\\nI, therefore, knew my _locale_ well.  It appeared that one of the female\\nperformers, whose benefit was shortly to take place, was very anxious to\\nobtain the patronage of Captain Delmar, and, with the usual tact of\\nwomen, had applied to my mother in the most obsequious manner,\\nrequesting her to espouse her cause with the gallant captain.\\n\\nMy mother, pleased with the idea of becoming, as it were, a patroness\\nunder the rose, did so effectually exert her influence over the captain,\\nthat, in a day or two afterwards, play-bills were posted all over the\\ntown, announcing that the play of _The Stranger_, with the farce of\\n_Raising the Wind_, would be performed on Friday evening, for the\\nbenefit of Miss Mortimer under the patronage of the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar, and the officers of his Majesty\\'s ship Calliope.  Of course the\\ngrateful young lady sent my mother some tickets of admission, and two of\\nthem I reserved for Tommy Dott and myself.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had made a large party of ladies, and of course all the\\nofficers of the ship attended: the house was as full as it could hold.\\nMy mother and aunt were there in a retired part of the boxes; Tommy Dott\\nand I entered the theatre with them, and afterwards had gone up to what\\nis, at the theatres at seaports, usually denominated the slips, that is,\\nthe sides of the theatre on the same range as the gallery.  There was\\nCaptain Delmar with all his ladies and all his officers, occupying\\nnearly the whole of the side of the dress circle below us, we having\\ntaken our position above him, so that we might not be observed.\\n\\nThe performance commenced.  Miss Mortimer, as _Mrs Haller_, was very\\neffective; and in the last scene was compelling the eyes of the company\\nto water, when we thought we would produce a still greater effect.\\n\\nWe had purchased a pound of the finest Scotch snuff, which we had\\nenclosed in two pasteboard cases, similar in form to those of squibs,\\nonly about six times the size, and holding half a pound of snuff each.\\nOur object was, in doing this, that, by jerking it all out with a heave,\\nwe might at once throw it right into the centre of the theatre above, so\\nthat in its descent it might be fairly distributed among all parties.\\n\\nThere was no one in the slips with us, except midshipmen, and a\\ndescription of people who would consider it a good joke, and never would\\npeach if they perceived we were the culprits.\\n\\nAt a signal between us, just as _Mrs Haller_ was giving a paper to her\\nhusband did we give our shower of snuff to the audience, jerking it\\nright across the theatre.  In a few minutes the effect was prodigious;\\nCaptain Delmar\\'s party being right beneath us, probably received a\\ngreater share, for they commenced sneezing fast, then the boxes on the\\nother side, the pit followed, and at last _Mr and Mrs Haller_ and the\\n_Stranger_ were taken with such a fit of sneezing that they could no\\nlonger talk to each other.\\n\\nThe children were brought out to their parents to effect their\\nreconciliation, but they did nothing but sneeze, poor things; and at\\nlast the uproar was tremendous, and the curtain was dropped, not to loud\\nplaudits, but to loud sneezings from every part of the theatre.\\n\\nNever was there anything so ludicrous; the manager sent officers up to\\ndiscover the offenders but no one could tell who had played the trick;\\nhe then came before the curtain to make a speech upon the occasion, but,\\nhaving sneezed seven or eight times, he was obliged to retire with his\\nhandkerchief to his nose; and the audience, finding it impossible to\\ncheck the titillation of the olfactory nerves, abandoned the theatre as\\nfast as they could, leaving the farce of _Raising the Wind_ to be\\nperformed to empty beaches.\\n\\nI hardly need say, that as soon as we had thrown the snuff, Mr Dott and\\nI had gone down and taken our places very demurely in the box by the\\nside of my mother, and appeared just as astonished, and indeed added as\\nmuch as possible to the company of sneezers.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was very furious at this want of respect of certain\\nparties unknown, and had we been discovered, whatever might have been my\\nfate, it would have gone hard with Tommy Dott; but we kept our own\\ncounsel, and escaped.\\n\\nThat I was suspected by Aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman is certain, and\\nmy aunt taxed me with it, but I would not confess; my mother also had\\nher suspicions, but as Captain Delmar had none, that was of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nThe success of this trick was a great temptation to try another or two\\nupon the noble captain.  He was, however saved by the simple fact of\\nH.M. ship Calliope being reported manned and ready for sea; orders were\\nsent down for his going round to Portsmouth to await the commands of the\\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and Captain Delmar came to pay his\\nfarewell visit.\\n\\nThe report from the schoolmaster had been very favourable and Captain\\nDelmar then asked me, for the first time, if I would like to be a\\nsailor.  As Captain Bridgeman had advised me not to reject any good\\noffer on the part of the honourable captain, I answered in the\\naffirmative; whereupon the captain replied, that if I paid attention to\\nmy learning, in a year\\'s time he would take me with him on board of his\\nfrigate.\\n\\nHe then patted my head, forgot to give me half a crown, and, shaking\\nhands with my mother and aunt, quitted the house, followed by Tommy\\nDott, who, as he went away, turned and laughed his adieu.\\n\\nI have not mentioned my grandmother lately.  The fact is, that when\\nCaptain Delmar made his appearance, for some cause or another, which I\\ncould not comprehend, she declared her intention of going away and\\npaying a visit to her old acquaintances at the Hall.  She did so.  As I\\nafterwards found out from what I overheard, she had a very great\\naversion to the noble captain: but the cause of her aversion was never\\ncommunicated to me.  Soon after the sailing of the Calliope, she again\\nmade her appearance, took her old seat in the easy-chair, and resumed\\nher eternal knitting as before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\\n\\nAnother year of my existence passed rapidly away; I was nearly thirteen\\nyears old, a sturdy bold boy, well fitted for the naval profession,\\nwhich I now considered decided upon, and began to be impatient to leave\\nschool, and wondered that we heard nothing of Captain Delmar, when news\\nwas received from another quarter.\\n\\nOne morning Captain Bridgeman came much earlier than usual, and with a\\nvery grave face put on especially for the occasion.  I had not set off\\nfor school, and ran up to him; but he checked me, and said, \"I must see\\nyour mother directly, I have very important news for her.\"\\n\\nI went in to tell my mother, who requested Captain Bridgeman to come\\ninto the parlour, and not being aware of the nature of the\\ncommunication, ordered Aunt Milly and me into the shop; we waited for\\nsome minutes, and then Captain Bridgeman made his appearance.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"Read this newspaper,\" said he; \"there is a despatch from India, it will\\ntell you all about it, and you can show it to your sister, when she is\\nmore composed.\"\\n\\nCurious to know what the matter could be, I quitted the shop, and went\\ninto the parlour, where I saw my mother with her face buried in the sofa\\npillow, and apparently in great distress.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, mother?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh! my child, my child!\" replied my mother, wringing her hands, \"you\\nare an orphan, and I am a lonely widow.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said my grandmother, \"why, are you such a fool, as not to\\nunderstand that your father is dead?\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead, is he?\" replied I, \"I\\'ll go and tell Aunt Milly;\" and\\naway I went out of the parlour to Milly, whom I found reading the\\nnewspaper.\\n\\n\"Aunt,\" said I, \"father\\'s dead, only to think!  I wonder how he died!\"\\n\\n\"He was killed in action, dear,\" said my aunt; \"look here, here is the\\naccount, and the list of killed and wounded.  D\\'ye see your father\\'s\\nname--Benjamin Keene, marine?\"\\n\\n\"Let me read all about it, Aunt Milly,\" replied I, taking the paper from\\nher; and I was soon very busy with the account of the action.\\n\\nMy readers must not suppose that I had no feeling, because I showed none\\nat my father\\'s death; if they call to mind the humble position in which\\nI had always seen my father, who dared not even intrude upon the\\npresence of those with whom my mother and I were on familiar terms, and\\nthat he was ordered about just like a servant by my mother, who set me\\nno example of fear or love for him, they will easily imagine that I felt\\nless for his death than I should have for that of Captain Bridgeman, or\\nmany others with whom I was on intimate terms.\\n\\nWhat did puzzle me was, that my mother should show so much feeling on\\nthe occasion.  I did not know the world then, and that decency required\\na certain display of grief.  Aunt Milly appeared to be very unconcerned\\nabout it, although, occasionally, she was in deep thought.  I put down\\nthe paper as soon as I had read the despatch, and said to her, \"Well, I\\nsuppose I must go to school now, aunt?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, dear,\" replied she, \"you can\\'t go to school for a few days now--\\nit wouldn\\'t be proper; you must remain at home and wait till you have\\nput on mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, at all events,\" replied I; \"I wonder where Captain\\nDelmar is, and why he don\\'t send for me; I begin to hate school.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say it won\\'t be long before you hear from him, dear,\" replied my\\naunt; \"stay here and mind the shop, while I go in to your mother.\"\\n\\nIf the truth was told, I am afraid that the death of Ben was a source of\\ncongratulation to all parties who were then in the parlour.  As for me,\\nI was very glad to have a few days\\' holiday, being perfectly indifferent\\nas to whether he was dead or alive.\\n\\nWhen I went in I found them in consultation as to the mourning: my\\nmother did not, in the first place, wish to make any a parade about a\\nhusband of whom she was ashamed; in the second, she did not like widow\\'s\\nweeds, and the unbecoming cap.  So it was decided, as Ben had been dead\\nsix months, and if they had known it before they would have been in\\nmourning for him all that time, that half-mourning was all that was\\nrequisite for them; and that, as for me, there was no reason for my\\ngoing into mourning at all.\\n\\nThree days after the intelligence, my mother re-appeared in the shop;\\nthe reason why she did not appear before was, that her dress was not\\nready--she looked very pretty indeed in half-mourning, so did my Aunt\\nMilly; and the attentions of the marine corps, especially Captain\\nBridgeman and Lieutenant Flat, were more unremitting than ever.\\n\\nIt appeared that, as the death of Ben had removed the great difficulty\\nto my aunt\\'s being married to an officer, my grandmother had resolved to\\nascertain the intentions of Captain Bridgeman, and if she found that he\\ncried off, to persuade Milly to consent to become Mrs Flat.  Whether\\nshe consulted my mother or my aunt on this occasion, I cannot positively\\nsay, but I rather think not.\\n\\nMy mother and my aunt were walking out one evening, when Captain\\nBridgeman came in, and my grandmother, who remained in the shop whenever\\nmy mother and Milly went out together, which was very seldom, requested\\nhim to walk into the back parlour, desiring me to remain in the shop,\\nand let her know if she was wanted.\\n\\nNow when they went into the parlour, the door was left ajar, and, as I\\nremained at the back part of the shop, I could not help over-hearing\\nevery word which was said; for my grandmother being very deaf, as most\\ndeaf people do, talked quite as loud as Captain Bridgeman was compelled\\nto do, to make her hear him.\\n\\n\"I wish, Captain Bridgeman, as a friend, to ask your advice relative to\\nmy daughter Amelia,\" said the old lady.  \"Please to take a chair.\"\\n\\n\"If there is any opinion that I can offer on the subject, madam, I shall\\nbe most happy to give it,\" replied the captain, sitting down as\\nrequested.\\n\\n\"You see, my daughter Amelia has been well brought up, and carefully\\neducated, as was, indeed, my daughter, Arabella, through the kindness of\\nmy old patron, Mrs Delmar, the aunt of the Honourable Captain Delmar,\\nwhom you have often met here, and who is heir to the title of de\\nVersely; that is to say, his eldest brother has no children.  I have\\nbeen nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential, Captain\\nBridgeman; the old lord was very fond of my husband, who was his\\nsteward, but he died, poor man, a long while ago; I am sure it would\\nhave broken his heart, if, in his lifetime, my daughter Arabella had\\nmade the foolish marriage which she did with a private marine--however,\\nwhat\\'s done can\\'t be helped, as the saying is--that\\'s all over now.\"\\n\\n\"It was certainly a great pity that Mrs Keene should have been so\\nfoolish,\" replied Captain Bridgeman, \"but, as you say, that is all over\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; God\\'s will be done, Captain Bridgeman; now you see, sir, that this\\nmarriage of Bella\\'s has done no good to the prospects of her sister\\nAmelia, who, nevertheless, is a good and pretty girl though I say it,\\nwho am her mother; and moreover, she will bring a pretty penny to her\\nhusband whoever he may be; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, my husband\\nwas not idle during the time that he was in the family of the Delmars,\\nand as her sister is so well to do, why little Amelia will come into a\\ngreater share than she otherwise would--that is, if she marries well,\\nand according to the wishes of her mother.\"\\n\\nAt this interesting part of the conversation Captain Bridgeman leant\\nmore earnestly towards my grandmother.\\n\\n\"A pretty penny, madam, you said; I never heard the expression before;\\nwhat may a pretty penny mean?\"\\n\\n\"It means, first and last, 4,000 pounds, Captain Bridgeman; part down,\\nand the other when I die.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"I certainly never thought that\\nMiss Amelia would ever have any fortune; indeed, she\\'s too pretty and\\naccomplished to require any.\"\\n\\n\"Now, sir,\" continued my grandmother, \"the point on which I wish to\\nconsult you is this: you know that Lieutenant Flat is very often here,\\nand for a long while has been very attentive to my daughter; he has, I\\nbelieve, almost as much as proposed--that is, in his sort of way; but my\\ndaughter does not seem to care for him.  Now, Captain Bridgeman, Mr\\nFlat may not be very clever, but I believe him to be a very worthy young\\nman; still one must be cautious, and what I wish to know before I\\ninterfere and persuade my daughter to marry him is, whether you think\\nthat Mr Flat is of a disposition which would make the marriage state a\\nhappy one; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, love before marriage is very\\napt to fly away, but love that comes after marriage will last out your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Well, madam,\" replied the captain, \"I will be candid with you; I do not\\nthink that a clever girl like Miss Amelia is likely to be happy as the\\nwife of my good friend Mr Flat--still there is nothing against his\\ncharacter, madam; I believe him harmless--very harmless.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a very fine-looking young man, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nothing to be found fault with in his appearance.\"\\n\\n\"Very good-natured.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he\\'s not very quick in temper, or anything else; he\\'s what we call\\na slow-coach.\"\\n\\n\"I hear he\\'s a very correct officer, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I am not aware that he has ever been under an arrest.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we cannot expect everything in this world; he is handsome,\\ngood-tempered, and a good officer--I cannot see why Amelia does not like\\nhim, particularly as her affections are not otherwise engaged.  I am\\nsatisfied with the answer you have given, Captain Bridgeman, and now I\\nshall point out to Amelia that I expect she will make up her mind to\\naccept Mr Flat.\"\\n\\nHere Captain Bridgeman hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam, if her affections are not otherwise engaged--I say--are\\nnot engaged, madam, I do not think she could do better.  Would, you like\\nme to sound Miss Amelia on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Really, Captain Bridgeman, it is very kind of you; you may, perhaps,\\npersuade her to listen to your friend Mr Flat.\"\\n\\n\"I will, at all events, ascertain her real sentiments, madam,\" said the\\ncaptain, rising; \"and, if you please, I will say farewell for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nAs my grandmother anticipated, the scale, which had been so long\\nbalanced by Captain Bridgeman, was weighed down in favour of marriage by\\nthe death of my father Ben, and the unexpected fortune of 4,000 pounds.\\n\\nThe next day the captain proposed and was accepted, and six weeks from\\nthat date my aunt Milly became his wife.\\n\\nThe wedding was very gay: some people did sneer at the match, but where\\nwas there ever a match without a sneer?  There are always and everywhere\\npeople to be found who will envy the happiness of others.  Some talked\\nabout the private marine; this attack was met with the 4,000 pounds (or\\nrather 8,000 pounds per annum, for rumour, as usual, had doubled the\\nsum); others talked of the shop as _infra dig_; the set-off against\\nwhich was, the education and beauty of the bride.  One or two subs\\'\\nwives declared that they would not visit Mrs Bridgeman; but when the\\ncolonel and his lady called to congratulate the new-married couple, and\\ninvited a large party in their own house to meet them, then then subs\\'\\nwives left their cards as soon as they could.\\n\\nIn a few weeks all was right again: my mother would not give up her\\nshop--it was too lucrative; but she was on more intimate terms with her\\ncustomers; and when people found that, although her sister was a\\ncaptain\\'s lady, my mother had too much sense to be ashamed of her\\nposition; why they liked her the better.  Indeed, as she was still very\\nhandsome, one or two of the marine officers, now that she was a widow,\\npaid her very assiduous court; but my mother had no intention of\\nentering again into the holy state--she preferred STATE _in quo_.  She\\nhad no one to care for but me, and for me she continued her shop and\\nlibrary, although, I believe, she could have retired upon a comfortable\\nindependence, had she chosen so to do.\\n\\nMy mother, whatever she might have been when a girl, was now a\\nstrong-minded, clever woman.  It must have been a painful thing for her\\nto have made up her mind to allow me to go to sea; I was her only child,\\nher only care; I believe she loved me dearly, although she was not so\\nlavish of her caresses as my aunt Milly; but she perceived that it would\\nbe for my advantage that I should insure the patronage and protection of\\nCaptain Delmar, and she sacrificed self to my interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\\n\\nAbout a month after my aunt\\'s marriage, a letter was received from\\nCaptain Delmar, who had arrived at Spithead, requesting my mother to\\nsend me to Portsmouth as soon as she could, and not go to the trouble or\\nexpense of fitting me out, as he would take that upon himself.\\n\\nThis was but short notice to give a fond mother, but there was no help\\nfor it; she returned an answer, that in three days from the date of the\\nletter I should be there.\\n\\nI was immediately summoned from school that she might see as much of me\\nas possible before I went; and although she did not attempt to detain\\nme, I perceived, very often, the tears run down her cheeks.\\n\\nMy grandmother thought proper to make me very long speeches every three\\nor four hours, the substance of which may be comprehended in very few\\nwords--to wit, that I had been a very bad boy, and that I was little\\nbetter now; that I had been spoiled by over-indulgence, and that it was\\nlucky my aunt Milly was not so much with me; that on board a man-of-war\\nI dare not play tricks, and that I would find it very different from\\nbeing at home with my mother; that Captain Delmar was a very great man,\\nand that I must be very respectful to him; that some day I should thank\\nher very much for her being so kind to me; that she hoped I would behave\\nwell, and that if I did not, she hoped that I would get a good beating.\\n\\nSuch was the burden of her song, till at last I got very tired of it,\\nand on the third evening I broke away from her, saying, \"Law, granny how\\nyou do twaddle!\" upon which she called me a good-for-nothing young\\nblackguard, and felt positively sure that I should be hanged.  The\\nconsequence was, that granny and I did not part good friends; and I\\nsincerely hoped that when I had come back again, I should not find her\\nabove ground.\\n\\nThe next morning I bade farewell to my dear Aunt Milly and Captain\\nBridgeman, received a very ungracious salute from granny, who appeared\\nto think, as she kissed me, that her lips were touching something\\npoisonous, and set off with my mother in the coach to Portsmouth.\\n\\nWe arrived safe at Portsmouth, and my mother immediately took lodgings\\non the Common Hard at Portsea.  The next day, having dressed herself\\nwith great care, with a very thick veil on her bonnet, my mother walked\\nwith me to the George Hotel, where Captain Delmar had taken up his\\nquarters.\\n\\nOn my mother sending up her card, we were immediately ushered upstairs,\\nand on entering the room found the Honourable Captain Delmar sitting\\ndown in full uniform--his sword, and hat, and numerous papers, lying on\\nthe table before him.  On one side of the table stood a lieutenant, hat\\nin hand; on the other, the captain\\'s clerk, with papers for him to sign.\\nMy friend Tommy Dott was standing at the window, chasing a blue-bottle\\nfly, for want of something better to do; and the steward was waiting for\\norders behind the captain\\'s chair.\\n\\nMy mother, who had pulled down her veil, so that her face was not\\nvisible, made a slight courtesy to Captain Delmar, who rose up and\\nadvanced to receive her very graciously, requesting that she would be\\nseated for a minute or two, till he had time to speak to her.\\n\\nI have thought since, that my honourable captain had a mind to impress\\nupon my mother the state and dignity of a captain in his Majesty\\'s\\nservice, when in commission.  He took no notice whatever of me.  Tommy\\nDott gave me a wink of his eye from the window, and I returned the\\ncompliment by putting my tongue into my cheek; but the other parties\\nwere too much occupied with the captain to perceive our friendly\\nrecognition.  Captain Delmar continued to give various orders, and after\\na time the officers attending were dismissed.\\n\\nAs soon as we were alone, my mother was addressed in, I thought, rather\\na pompous way, and very much in contrast with his previous politeness\\nbefore others.  Captain Delmar informed her that he should take me\\nimmediately under his protection, pay all my expenses, and, if I behaved\\nwell, advance me in the service.\\n\\nAt this announcement, my mother expressed a great deal of gratitude,\\nand, shedding a few tears, said, that the boy would in future look up to\\nhim as a parent.  To this speech Captain Delmar made no reply; but,\\nchanging the conversation, told her that he expected to sail in about\\nthree or four days, and that no time must be lost in fitting me out;\\nthat, all things considered, he thought it advisable that she should\\nreturn at once to Chatham, and leave the boy with him as she could not\\nknow what was requisite for me, and would therefore be of no use.\\n\\nAt the idea of parting with me, my mother cried bitterly.  Captain\\nDelmar did then rise off his chair, and taking my mother by the hand\\nspeak to her a few words of consolation.  My mother removed her\\nhandkerchief from her eyes and sighed deeply, saying to Captain Delmar,\\nwith an appealing look, \"Oh!  Captain Delmar, remember that for you I\\nhave indeed made great sacrifices; do not forget them, when you look at\\nthat boy, who is very dear to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will do him justice,\" replied the captain, somewhat affected, \"but I\\nmust insist upon inviolable secrecy on your part; you must promise me\\nthat under any circumstances--\"\\n\\n\"I have obeyed you for thirteen years,\" replied my mother; \"I am not\\nlikely to forget my promise now; it is hard to part with him, but I\\nleave him in the hands of--\"\\n\\n\"You forget the boy is there,\" interrupted Captain Delmar; \"take him\\naway now; to-morrow morning I will send my coxswain for him, and you\\nmust go back to Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"God bless you, sir,\" replied my mother, weeping, as Captain Delmar\\nshook her hand, and then we left the room.  As we were walking back to\\nour lodging, I inquired of my mother--\"What\\'s the secret between you and\\nCaptain Delmar, mother?\"\\n\\n\"The secret, child!  Oh, something which took place at the time I was\\nliving with his aunt, and which he does not wish to have known; so ask\\nme no more questions about it.\"\\n\\nAfter our return, my mother gave me a great deal of advice.  She told me\\nthat, as I had lost my father Ben, I must now look upon Captain Delmar\\nas a father to me; that Ben had been a faithful servant to the captain,\\nand that she had been the same to Mrs Delmar, his aunt; and that was\\nthe reason why Captain Delmar was interested about me, and had promised\\nto do so much for me; begging me to treat him with great respect and\\nnever venture to play him any tricks, or otherwise he would be highly\\noffended, and send me home again; and then I should never rise to be an\\nofficer in his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\nI cannot say the advice received the attention it deserved, for I felt\\nmore inclined to play tricks to my honourable captain than any person I\\never met with; however, I appeared to consent, and, in return begged my\\nmother to take care of my dog Bob, which she promised to do.\\n\\nMy mother cried a great deal during the night; the next morning she gave\\nme five guineas as pocket-money, recommending me to be careful of it,\\nand telling me I must look to Captain Delmar for my future supply.  She\\ntied up the little linen I had brought with me in a handkerchief, and\\nshortly after the coxswain knocked at the door, and came upstairs to\\nclaim me for his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\n\"I\\'m come for the youngster, if you please, marm,\" said the coxswain, a\\nfine, tall seaman, remarkably clean and neat in his dress.\\n\\nMy mother put her arms round me, and burst into tears.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, marm,\" said the coxswain, after standing silent\\nabout a minute, \"but could not you _do the piping_ after the youngster\\'s\\ngone?  If I stay here long I shall be blowed up by the skipper, as sure\\nas my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\n\"I will detain you but a few seconds longer,\" replied my mother; \"I may\\nnever see him again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s a fact; my poor mother never did me,\" replied the\\ncoxswain.\\n\\nThis observation did not raise my mother\\'s spirits.  Another pause\\nensued, during which I was bedewed with her tears, when the coxswain\\napproached again--\\n\\n\"I ax your pardon, marm; but if you know anything of Captain Delmar, you\\nmust know he\\'s not a man to be played with, and you would not wish to\\nget me into trouble.  It\\'s a hard thing to part with a child, I\\'m told,\\nbut it wouldn\\'t help me if I said anything about your tears.  If the\\ncaptain were to go to the boat, and find me not there, he\\'d just say,\\n`What were my orders, sir?\\' and after that, you know, marm, there is not\\na word for me to say.\"\\n\\n\"Take him, then, my good man,\" replied my mother, pressing me\\nconvulsively to her heart--\"take him; Heaven bless you, my dear child.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kind of you,\" replied the coxswain.  \"Come, my\\nlittle fellow, we\\'ll soon make a man of you.\"\\n\\nI once more pressed my lips to my poor mother\\'s, and she resigned me to\\nthe coxswain, at the same time taking some silver off the table and\\nputting it into his hand.\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kinder still, to think of another when you\\'re in\\ndistress yourself; I shan\\'t forget it.  I\\'ll look after the lad a bit\\nfor you, as sure as my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\nMy mother sank down on the sofa, with her handkerchief to her eyes.\\n\\nBob Cross caught up the bundle, and led me away.  I was very melancholy,\\nfor I loved my mother, and could not bear to see her so distressed, and\\nfor some time we walked on without speaking.\\n\\nThe coxswain first broke the silence:--\"What\\'s your name, my little\\nTrojan?\" said he.\\n\\n\"Percival Keene.\"\\n\\n\"Well I\\'m blessed if I didn\\'t think that you were one of the Delmar\\nbreed, by the cut of your jib; howsomever, it\\'s a wise child that knows\\nits own father.\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Dead!  Well, fathers do die sometimes; you must get on how you can\\nwithout one.  I don\\'t think fathers are of much use, for, you see,\\nmothers take care of you till you\\'re old enough to go to sea.  My father\\ndid nothing for me, except to help mother to lick me, when I was\\nobstropolous.\"\\n\\nThe reader, from what he has already been informed about Ben, the\\nmarine, may easily conceive that I was very much of Bob Cross\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\"I suppose you don\\'t know anybody on board--do you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know Tommy Dott--I knew him when the ship was at Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr Tommy Dott; I dare say you\\'re just like him, for you look full\\nof mischief.  He\\'s a very nice young man for a small party, as the\\nsaying is; there is more devil in his little carcase than in two\\nwomen\\'s, and that\\'s not a trifle; you\\'ll hunt in couples, I dare say,\\nand get well flogged at the same gun, if you don\\'t take care.  Now, here\\nwe are, and I must report my arrival with you under convoy.\"\\n\\nBob Cross sent a waiter for the captain\\'s steward, who went up to\\nCaptain Delmar.  I was ordered to go upstairs, and again found myself in\\nthe presence of the noble captain, and a very stout elderly man, with a\\nflaxen wig.\\n\\n\"This is the lad,\" said Captain Delmar, when I came into the room and\\nwalked up to him; \"you know exactly what he requires; oblige me by\\nseeing him properly fitted out and the bill sent in to me.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" said the old\\ngentleman, with a profound bow.\\n\\n\"You had better not order too many things, as he is growing fast; it\\nwill be easy to make good any deficiencies as they may be required.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be most strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" replied the\\nold gentleman, with another bow.\\n\\n\"I hardly know what to do with him for to-day and to-morrow, until his\\nuniforms are made,\" continued the captain: \"I suppose he must go on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"If you have no objection, Captain Delmar,\" said the old gentleman, with\\nanother low bow, \"I am sure that Mrs Culpepper will be most proud to\\ntake charge of any _protege_ of yours; we have a spare bed, and the\\nyoung gentleman can remain with us until he is ready to embark in the\\nuniform of his rank.\"\\n\\n\"Be it so, Mr Culpepper; let your wife take care of him until all is\\ncomplete, and his chest is ready.  You\\'ll oblige me by arranging about\\nhis mess.\"\\n\\n\"Your wishes shall be most strictly attended to, Captain Delmar,\"\\nreplied Mr Culpepper, with another profound inclination, which made me\\nfeel very much inclined to laugh.\\n\\n\"If you have no further orders, Captain Delmar, I will now take the\\nyoung gentleman with me.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more, Mr Culpepper--good morning,\" replied Captain Delmar, who\\nneither said how d\\'ye do to me when I came in, or good bye when I went\\naway in company with Mr Culpepper.  I had yet to learn what a thing of\\nno consequence was a \"sucking Nelson.\"\\n\\nI followed Mr Culpepper down stairs, who desired me to remain with the\\ncoxswain, who was standing under the archway, while he spoke to the\\ncaptain\\'s steward.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob Cross, \"what\\'s the ticket, youngster,--are you to go\\nabroad with me?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I; \"I am to stay on shore with that old chap, who does\\nnothing but bob his head up and down.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s our nipcheese.\"\\n\\n\"Nipcheese!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nipcheese means purser of the ship--you\\'ll find all that out\\nby-and-by; you\\'ve got lots to larn, and, by way of a hint, make him your\\nfriend if you can, for he earwigs the captain in fine style.\"\\n\\nPerceiving that I did not understand him, Bob Cross continued: \"I mean\\nthat our captain\\'s very fond of the officers paying him great respect,\\nand he likes all that bowing and scraping; he don\\'t like officers or men\\nto touch their hats, but to take them right off their heads when they\\nspeak to him.  You see, he\\'s a sprig of nobility, as they call it, and\\nwhat\\'s more he\\'s also a post-captain, and thinks no small beer of\\nhimself; so don\\'t forget what I say--here comes the purser.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper now came out, and, taking my hand, led me away to his own\\nhouse, which was at Southsea.  He did not speak a word during the walk,\\nbut appeared to be in deep cogitation: at last we arrived at his door.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\\n\\nWhy is it that I detain the reader with Mr Culpepper and his family?  I\\ndon\\'t know, but I certainly have an inclination to linger over every\\nlittle detail of events which occurred upon my first plunging into the\\nsea of life, just as naked boys on the New River side stand shivering a\\nwhile, before they can make up their minds to dash into the unnatural\\nelement; for men are not ducks, although they do show some affinity to\\ngeese by their venturing upon the treacherous fluid.\\n\\nThe door was opened, and I found myself in the presence of Mrs\\nCulpepper and her daughter,--the heiress, as I afterwards discovered, to\\nall Mr Culpepper\\'s savings, which were asserted to be something\\nconsiderable after thirty years\\' employment as purser of various vessels\\nbelonging to his Majesty.\\n\\nMrs Culpepper was in person enormous--she looked like a feather-bed\\nstanding on end; her cheeks were as large as a dinner-plate, eyes almost\\nas imperceptible as a mole\\'s, nose just visible, mouth like a round O.\\nIt was said that she was once a great Devonshire beauty.  Time, who has\\nbeen denominated _Edax rerum_, certainly had as yet left her untouched,\\nreserving her for a _bonne bouche_ on some future occasion.\\n\\nShe sat in a very large arm-chair--indeed, no common-sized chair could\\nhave received her capacious person.  She did not get up when I entered;\\nindeed, as I discovered, she made but two attempts to stand during the\\ntwenty-four hours; one was to come out of her bedroom, which was on the\\nsame floor as the parlour, and the other to go in again.\\n\\nMiss Culpepper was somewhat of her mother\\'s build.  She might have been\\ntwenty years old, and was, for a girl of her age, exuberantly fat; yet\\nas her skin and complexion were not coarse, many thought her handsome;\\nbut she promised to be as large as her mother, and certainly was not at\\nall suited for a wife to a subaltern of a marching regiment.\\n\\n\"Who have we here?\" said Mrs Culpepper to her husband, in a sort of low\\ncroak; for she was so smothered with fat that she could not get her\\nvoice out.\\n\\n\"Well, I hardly know,\" replied the gentleman, wiping his forehead; \"but\\nI\\'ve my own opinion.\"\\n\\n\"Mercy on me, how very like!\" exclaimed Miss Culpepper, looking at me,\\nand then at her father.  \"Would not you like to go into the garden,\\nlittle boy?\" continued she: \"there, through the passage, out of the\\ndoor,--you can\\'t miss it.\"\\n\\nAs this was almost a command, I did not refuse to go; but as soon as I\\nwas in the garden, which was a small patch of ground behind the house,\\nas the window to the parlour was open, and my curiosity was excited by\\ntheir evidently wishing to say something which they did not wish me to\\nhear, I stopped under the window and listened.\\n\\n\"The very picture of him,\" continued the young lady.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, very like indeed,\" croaked the old one.\\n\\n\"All I know is,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"Captain Delmar has desired me to\\nfit him out, and that he pays all the expenses.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s another proof,\" said the young lady; \"he wouldn\\'t pay for\\nother people\\'s children.\"\\n\\n\"He was brought down here by a very respectable-looking, I may say\\ninteresting, and rather pretty woman,--I should think about thirty.\"\\n\\n\"Then she must have been handsome when this boy was born,\" replied the\\nyoung lady: \"I consider that another proof.  Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"Went away this morning by the day-coach, leaving the boy with the\\ncaptain, who sent his coxswain for him.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s mystery about that,\" rejoined the daughter, \"and therefore I\\nconsider it another proof.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"and a strong one too.  Captain Delmar is so\\nhigh and mighty, that he would not have it thought that he could ever\\ncondescend to have an intrigue with one beneath him in rank and station,\\nand he has sent her away on that account, depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Just so; and if that boy is not a son of Captain Delmar, I\\'m not a\\nwoman.\"\\n\\n\"I am of that opinion,\" replied the father, \"and therefore I offered to\\ntake charge of him, as the captain did not know what to do with him till\\nhis uniform was ready.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied Miss Culpepper, \"I\\'ll soon find out more.  I\\'ll pump\\neverything that he knows out of him before he leaves us; I know how to\\nput that and that together.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" croaked the fat mother; \"Medea knows how to put that and that\\ntogether, as well as any one.\"\\n\\n\"You must be very civil and very kind to him,\" said Mr Culpepper; \"for\\ndepend upon it, the very circumstance of the captain\\'s being compelled\\nto keep the boy at a distance will make him feel more fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no patience with the men in that respect,\" observed the young\\nlady: \"how nobility can so demean themselves I can\\'t think; no wonder\\nthey are ashamed of what they have done, and will not acknowledge their\\nown offspring.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"If a woman has the misfortune to yield to her inclinations, they don\\'t\\nlet her off so easily,\" exclaimed Miss Medea.\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the mamma again.\\n\\n\"Men make the laws and break them,\" continued Miss Culpepper.  \"Mere\\nbrute strength, even in the most civilised society.  If all women had\\nonly the spirit that I have, there would be a little alteration, and\\nmore justice.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t pretend to argue with you, Medea,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"I\\ntake the world as I find it, and make the best of it.  I must go now,--\\nmy steward is waiting for me at the victualling office.  Just brush my\\nhat a little, Medea, the wind has raised the nap, and then I\\'ll be off.\"\\n\\nI walked very softly from the window; a new light had burst upon me.\\nYoung as I was, I also could put that and that together.  I called to\\nmind the conduct of my mother towards her husband Ben; the dislike of my\\ngrandmother to Captain Delmar; the occasional conversations I had\\noverheard; the question of my mother checked before it was finished--\"If\\nI knew who it was that I had been playing the trick to;\" the visits my\\nmother received from Captain Delmar, who was so haughty and distant to\\neverybody; his promise to provide for me, and my mother\\'s injunctions to\\nme to be obedient and look up to him as a father, and the remarks of the\\ncoxswain, Bob Cross,--\"If I were not of the Delmar breed:\" all this,\\nadded to what I had just overheard, satisfied me that they were not\\nwrong in their conjectures, and that I really was the son of the\\nhonourable captain.\\n\\nMy mother had gone; I would have given worlds to have gained this\\ninformation before, that I might have questioned her, and obtained the\\ntruth from her; but that was now impossible, and I felt convinced that\\nwriting was of no use.  I recollected the conversation between her and\\nthe Captain, in which she promised to keep the secret, and the answer\\nshe gave me when I questioned her; nothing, then, but my tears and\\nentreaties could have any effect, and those, I knew, were powerful over\\nher; neither would it be of any use to ask Aunt Milly, for she would not\\ntell her sister\\'s secrets, so I resolved to say nothing about it for the\\npresent; and I did not forget that Mr Culpepper had said that Captain\\nDelmar would be annoyed if it was supposed that I was his son; I\\nresolved, therefore, that I would not let him imagine that I knew\\nanything about it, or had any idea of it.\\n\\nI remained more than an hour in deep thought, and it was strange what a\\ntumult there was in my young heart at this discovery.  I hardly\\ncomprehended the nature of my position, yet I felt pleased on the whole;\\nI felt as if I were of more importance; nay, that I was more capable of\\nthinking and acting than I was twenty-four hours before.\\n\\nMy reveries were, however, disturbed by Miss Medea, who came to the\\nback-door and asked me if I was not tired of walking, and if I would not\\nlike to come in.\\n\\n\"Are you not hungry, Master Keene?  Would you like to have a nice piece\\nof cake and a glass of currant wine before dinner?  We shall not dine\\ntill three o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" replied I: for I would not refuse the bribe, although I\\nhad a perfect knowledge why it was offered.\\n\\nMiss Medea brought the cake and wine.  As soon as I had despatched them,\\nwhich did not take very long, she commenced her pumping, as I had\\nanticipated, and which I was determined to thwart, merely out of\\nopposition.\\n\\n\"You were sorry to leave your mamma, weren\\'t you, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; very sorry, miss.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your papa, dearest?  He\\'s a very pretty boy, mamma, ain\\'t he?\"\\ncontinued the young lady, putting her fingers through my chestnut curls.\\n\\n\"Yes; handsome boy,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"Papa\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead!  I thought so,\" observed Miss Medea, winking at her mother.\\n\\n\"Did you ever see your papa, dearest?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; he went to sea about eighteen months ago, and he was killed in\\naction.\"\\n\\nAfter this came on a series of questions and cross-questions; I replied\\nto her so as to make it appear that Ben was my father, and nobody else,\\nalthough I had then a very different opinion.  The fact was, I was\\ndetermined that I would not be pumped, and I puzzled them, for I stated\\nthat my aunt Milly was married to Captain Bridgeman, of the marines; and\\nnot till then did Miss Medea ask me what my father was.  My reply was\\nthat he had also been in the marines, and they consequently put him down\\nas a marine officer, as well as Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nThis added so much to the respectability of my family, that they were\\nquite mystified, and found that it was not quite so easy to put that and\\nthat together as they had thought.\\n\\nAs soon as they were tired of questioning, they asked me if I would not\\nlike to take another turn in the garden, to which I consented; and,\\nplacing myself under the window as before, I heard Miss Medea say to her\\nmother--\\n\\n\"Father\\'s always finding out some mare\\'s nest or another; and because\\nthere is some likeness to the captain, he has, in his great wit, made an\\nimportant discovery.  It\\'s quite evident that he\\'s wrong, as he\\ngenerally is.  It\\'s not very likely that Captain Delmar should have had\\nan intrigue with the wife of a marine officer, and her sister married\\nalso into the corps.  The widow has brought him down herself, it is\\ntrue, but that proves nothing; who else was to bring him down, if it was\\nnot his mother? and the very circumstance of her going away so soon\\nproves that she felt it improper that she should remain; and, in my\\nopinion, that she is a modest, interesting young woman, in whom Captain\\nDelmar has taken an interest.  I wish father would not come here with\\nhis nonsensical ideas, telling us to make much of the boy.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Medea,\" replied the mother; \"you might have saved that cake\\nand wine.\"\\n\\nThinks I to myself, you have not pumped me, and I never felt more\\ndelighted than at having outwitted them.  I thought it, however, prudent\\nto walk away from the window.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, Mr Culpepper returned, accompanied by one of the\\nnumerous Portsmouth fitting-out tailors.  I was summoned; the tailor\\npresented a list of what he declared to be absolutely necessary for the\\noutfit of a gentleman.\\n\\nMr Culpepper struck out two-thirds of the articles, and desired the\\nremainder to be ready on the Friday morning, it being then Wednesday.\\nThe tailor promised faithfully, and Mr Culpepper also promised most\\nfaithfully, that if the articles were not ready, they would be left on\\nhis hands.  As soon as the tailor had gone, Miss Medea asked me if I\\nwould not like to take another run in the garden.  I knew that she\\nwished to speak to her father, and therefore had a pleasure in\\ndisappointing her.  I therefore replied, that I had been there nearly\\nthe whole day, and did not wish to go out any more.\\n\\n\"Never mind whether you wish it or not; I wish you to go,\" replied Miss\\nMedea, tartly.\\n\\n\"Medea, how can you be so rude?\" cried Mr Culpepper; \"surely Mr Keene\\nmay do as he pleases.  I\\'m surprised at you, Medea.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'m surprised at you, papa, finding out a mystery when there is\\nnone,\" replied Miss Medea, very cross.  \"All you said this morning, and\\nall your surmises, have turned out to be all moonshine.  Yes, you may\\nlook, papa; I tell you--all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Medea, what nonsense you are talking,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s right,\" croaked Mrs Culpepper; \"all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"So you need not be so very particular, papa, I can tell you,\" rejoined\\nMiss Medea, who then whispered in her father\\'s ear, loud enough for me\\nto hear, \"No such thing, nothing but a regular marine.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, nonsense,\" replied the purser, in a low voice; \"the boy has been\\ntaught to say it--he\\'s too clever for you, Medea.\"\\n\\nAt this very true remark of her father\\'s, Miss Medea swelled into a\\ntowering passion, her whole face, neck, and shoulders--for she wore a\\nlow gown in the morning--turning to a fiery scarlet.  I never saw such a\\nfury as she appeared to be.  She rushed by me so roughly, that I was\\nthrown back a couple of paces, and then she bounced out of the room.\\n\\n\"Medea knows how to put that and that together, Mr Culpepper,\" croaked\\nout Mrs Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s wise in her own conceit, and you\\'re a regular old fool,\"\\nrejoined Mr Culpepper, with asperity; \"one too knowing and the other\\nnot half knowing enough.  Master Keene, I hope you are hungry, for we\\nhave a very nice dinner.  Do you like ducks and green peas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, very much,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Were you born at Chatham, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I was born at the Hall, near Southampton.  My mother was\\nbrought up by old Mrs Delmar, the captain\\'s aunt.\"\\n\\nI gave this intelligence on purpose; as I knew it would puzzle Miss\\nMedea, who had just returned from the kitchen.\\n\\nMr Culpepper nodded his head triumphantly to his daughter and wife, who\\nboth appeared dumb-founded at this new light thrown upon the affair.\\n\\nMiss Medea paused a moment and then said to me,--\"I wish to ask you one\\nquestion, Master Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I will not answer any more of your questions, miss,\" replied I; \"You\\nhave been questioning me all the morning, and just now, you were so rude\\nas nearly to push me down.  If you want to know anything more, ask\\nCaptain Delmar; or, if you wish it, I will ask Captain Delmar whether I\\nam to answer you, and if he says I am, I will, but not without.\"\\n\\nThis was a decided blow on my part; mother and Medea both looked\\nfrightened, and Mr Culpepper was more alarmed than either of the\\nfemales.  It proved to them that I knew what they were inquiring for,\\nwhich was to them also proof that I also knew who I was; and further, my\\nreference to Captain Delmar satisfied them that I felt sure of his\\nsupport, and they knew that he would be very much irritated if I told\\nhim on what score they had been pumping me.\\n\\n\"You are very right, Master Keene,\" said Mr Culpepper, turning very\\nred, \"to refuse to answer any questions you don\\'t like; and, Medea, I\\'m\\nsurprised at your behaviour; I insist upon it you do not annoy Master\\nKeene with any more of your impertinent curiosity.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" croaked the old lady; \"hold your tongue, Medea, hold your\\ntongue.\"\\n\\nMiss Medea, who looked as if she could tear my eyes out if she dared,\\nswallowed down her rage as well as she could.  She was mortified at\\nfinding she had made a mistake, annoyed at my answering her so boldly,\\nand frightened at her father\\'s anger; for the old gentleman was very apt\\nto vent it in the _argumentum ad feminam_, and box her ears soundly.\\n\\nFortunately dinner was served just at this moment, and this gave a turn\\nto the conversation, and also to their thoughts.  Mr Culpepper was all\\nattention, and Miss Medea, gradually recovering her temper, also became\\naffable and condescending.\\n\\nThe evening passed away very agreeably; but I went to bed early, as I\\nwished to be left to my own reflections, and it was not till daylight\\nthat I could compose my troubled mind so as to fall asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough the aversion which I had taken to the whole Culpepper family\\nwas so great, that I could have done anything to annoy them, my mind was\\nnow so fully occupied with the information which I had collected\\nrelative to my supposed birth and parentage, that I could not think of\\nmischief.\\n\\nI walked on the common or in the little garden during the whole of the\\nfollowing day, plunged in deep thought, and at night, when I went to\\nbed, I remained awake till the dawn.  During these last two days I had\\nthought and reflected more than I had perhaps done from the hour of my\\nbirth.\\n\\nThat I was better off than I should have been if I had been the son of a\\nprivate in the marines, I felt convinced; but still I had a feeling that\\nI was in a position in which I might be subjected to much insult, and\\nthat, unless I was acknowledged by my aristocratic parent, my connection\\nwith his family would be of no use to me;--and Captain Delmar, how was I\\nto behave to him?  I did not like him much, that was certain, nor did\\nthis new light which had burst forth make me feel any more love for him\\nthan I did before.  Still my mother\\'s words at Chatham rung in my ears,\\n\"Do you know who it is that you have been?\" etcetera.  I felt sure that\\nhe was my father, and I felt a sort of duty towards him; perhaps an\\nincrease of respect.\\n\\nThese were anxious thoughts for a boy not fourteen; and the Culpeppers\\nremarked, that I had not only looked very pale, but had actually grown\\nthin in the face during my short stay.\\n\\nAs I was very quiet and reserved after the first day, they were very\\nglad when my clothes were brought home, and I was reported ready to\\nembark; so was I, for I wanted to go on board and see my friend Tommy\\nDott, with whom I intended, if the subject was brought up, to consult as\\nto my proceedings, or perhaps I thought it would be better to consult\\nBob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain; I was not sure that I should not\\nadvise with them both.\\n\\nI had made up my mind how to behave to my mother.  I knew that she would\\nnever acknowledge the truth, after what had passed between the captain\\nand her when I was present; but I was resolved that I would let her know\\nthat I was in the secret; and I thought that the reply to me would be a\\nguide as to the correctness of the fact, which, with all the hastiness\\nof boyhood, I considered as incontrovertible, although I had not the\\nleast positive proof.\\n\\nThe day that I was to go on board, I requested Miss Culpepper to give me\\na sheet of paper, that I might write to my mother; she supplied me very\\nreadily, saying, \"You had better let me see if you make any mistake in\\nyour spelling before the letter goes; your mamma will be so pleased if\\nyou write your letter properly.\"  She then went down into the kitchen to\\ngive some orders.\\n\\nAs I had not the slightest intention that she should read what I wrote,\\nand resolved to have it in the post before she came up again, I was very\\nconcise in my epistle, which was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"Dear Mother:--I have found it all out--I am the son of Captain\\n  Delmar, and everyone here knows what you have kept a secret from me.\\n  I go on board to-day.\\n\\n  \"Yours truly, P. KEENE.\"\\n\\nThis was very short, and, it must be admitted, direct to the point.  I\\ncould not perhaps have written one which was so calculated to give my\\nmother uneasiness.\\n\\nAs soon as it was finished, I folded it up, and lighted a taper to seal\\nit.  Old Mrs Culpepper, who was in the room, croaked out, \"No, no; you\\nmust show it to Medea.\"  But I paid no attention to her, and having\\nsealed my letter, put on my hat, and walked out to the post-office.  I\\ndropped it into the box, and, on returning, found Mr Culpepper coming\\nhome, accompanied by Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain, and two of the\\nboat\\'s crew.\\n\\nAs I presumed, they were sent for me; I joined them immediately, and was\\nkindly greeted by Bob Cross, who said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, are you all ready for shipping?  We\\'ve come for your\\ntraps.\"\\n\\n\"All ready,\" replied I, \"and very glad to go, for I\\'m tired of staying\\non shore doing nothing.\"\\n\\nWe were soon at the house; the seamen carried away my chest and bedding,\\nwhile Bob Cross remained a little while, that I might pay my farewell to\\nthe ladies.\\n\\nThe ceremony was not attended with much regret on either side.  Miss\\nCulpepper could not help asking me why I did not show her my letter, and\\nI replied, that there were secrets in it, which answer did not at all\\nadd to her good temper; our adieus were, therefore, anything but\\naffectionate, and before the men with my effects were a hundred yards in\\nadvance, Bob Cross and I were at their heels.\\n\\n\"Well, Master Keene,\" said Bob, as we wended our way across South Sea\\nCommon, \"how do you like the purser\\'s ladies?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" replied I; \"they have done nothing but try to pump me the\\nwhole time I have been there; but they did not make much of it.\"\\n\\n\"Women will be curious, Master Keene--pray what did they try to pump\\nabout?\"\\n\\nI hardly knew how to reply, and I hesitated.  I felt a strong\\ninclination towards Bob Cross, and I had before reflected whether I\\nshould make him my confidant; still, I was undecided and made no reply,\\nwhen Bob Cross answered for me:--\\n\\n\"Look ye, child--for although you\\'re going on the quarter-deck, and I am\\nbefore the mast, you are a child compared to me--I can tell you what\\nthey tried to pump about, as well as you can tell me, if you choose.\\nAccording to my thinking, there\\'s no lad on board the frigate that will\\nrequire good advice as you will; and I tell you candidly, you will have\\nyour cards to play.  Bob Cross is no fool, and can see as far through a\\nfog as most chaps; I like you for yourself as far as I see of you, and I\\nhave not forgotten your mother\\'s kindness to me, when she had her own\\nmisery to occupy her thoughts; not that I wanted the money--it wasn\\'t\\nthe money, but the way and the circumstances under which it was given.\\nI told you I\\'d look after you a bit--a bit means a great deal with me--\\nand so I will, if you choose that I shall; if not, I shall touch my hat\\nto you, as my officer, which won\\'t help you very much.  So, now you have\\nto settle, my lad, whether you will have me as your friend, or not.\"\\n\\nThe appeal quite decided me.  \"Bob Cross,\" replied I.  \"I do wish to\\nmake you my friend; I thought of it before, but I did not know whether\\nto go to you or to Tommy Dott.\"\\n\\n\"Tommy Dott!  Well, Master Keene, that\\'s not very flattering, to put me\\nin one scale, and Tommy Dott in the other; I\\'m not surprised at its\\nweighing down in my favour.  If you wish to get into mischief you can\\'t\\napply to a better hand than Tommy Dott; but Tommy Dott is not half so\\nfit to advise you, as you are, I expect, to advise him; so make him your\\nplaymate and companion, if you please, but as to his advice, it\\'s not\\nworth asking.  However, as you have given me the preference, I will now\\ntell you that the Culpepper people have been trying to find out who is\\nyour father.  Ain\\'t I right?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, this is no time to talk about such things; we shall be down\\nto the boat in another minute, so we\\'ll say no more at present; only\\nrecollect, when you are on board, if they talk about appointing a man to\\ntake charge of your hammock, say that Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain,\\nis, you understand, to be the person; say that and no more.  I will tell\\nyou why by-and-by, when we have time to talk together and if any of your\\nmessmates say anything to you on the same point which the Culpeppers\\nhave been working at, make no reply and hold yourself very stiff.  Now,\\nhere we are at the sally port, so there\\'s an end to our palaver for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nMy chest and bedding were already in the boat, and as soon as Cross and\\nI had stepped in he ordered the bowman to shove off; in half an hour we\\narrived alongside the frigate, which lay at Spithead, bright with new\\npaint, and with her pennant proudly flying to the breeze.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better follow me, sir, and mind you touch your hat when the\\nofficers speak to you,\" said Bob Cross, ascending the accommodation\\nladder.  I did so, and found myself on the quarter deck, in the presence\\nof the first lieutenant and several of the officers.\\n\\n\"Well, Cross,\" said the first lieutenant.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve brought a young gentleman on board to join the ship.  Captain\\nDelmar has, I believe, given his orders about him.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I presume?\" said the first lieutenant, eyeing me from head\\nto foot.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, touching my hat.\\n\\n\"How long have you been at Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Three days, sir; I have been staying at Mr Culpepper\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Well, did you fall in love with Miss Culpepper?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I hate her.\"\\n\\nAt this answer the first lieutenant and the officers near him burst out\\na-laughing.\\n\\n\"Well, youngster, you must dine with us in the gun-room to-day; and\\nwhere\\'s Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"Here, sir,\" said Tommy Dott, coming from the other side of the\\nquarter-deck.\\n\\n\"Mr Dott, take this young gentleman down below, and show him the\\nmidshipmen\\'s berth.  Let me see, who is to take care of his hammock?\"\\n\\n\"I believe that Bob Cross is to take care of it, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"The captain\\'s coxswain--humph.  Well, that\\'s settled at all events;\\nvery good--we shall have the pleasure of your company to dinner, Mr\\nKeene.  Why, Mr Dott and you look as if you knew each other.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t we, Tommy?\" said I to the midshipman, grinning.\\n\\n\"I suspect that there is a pair of you,\" said the first lieutenant,\\nturning aft and walking away; after which Tommy and I went down the\\ncompanion ladder as fast as we could, and in a few seconds afterwards\\nwere sitting together on the same chest, in most intimate conversation.\\n\\nMy extreme resemblance to our honourable captain was not unobserved by\\nthe officers who were on the quarter-deck at the time of my making my\\nappearance; and, as I afterwards heard from Bob Cross, he was sent for\\nby the surgeon, on some pretence or another, to obtain any information\\nrelative to me.  What were Bob Cross\\'s reasons for answering as he did I\\ncould not at that time comprehend, but he explained them to me\\nafterwards.\\n\\n\"Who brought him down, Cross?\" said the surgeon, carelessly.\\n\\n\"His own mother, sir; he has no father, sir, I hear.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her?  What sort of a person was she?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Bob Cross, \"I\\'ve seen many ladies of quality, but\\nsuch a real lady I don\\'t think I ever set my eyes upon before; and such\\na beauty--I\\'d marry to-morrow if I could take in tow a craft like her.\"\\n\\n\"How did they come down to Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, she came down to Portsmouth in a coach and four; but she\\nwalked to the George Hotel, as if she was nobody.\"\\n\\nThis was not a fib on the part of the coxswain, for we came down by the\\nPortsmouth coach; it did, however, deceive the surgeon, as was intended.\\n\\n\"Did you see anything of her, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"Not when she was with the captain, sir, but at her own lodgings I did;\\nsuch a generous lady I never met with.\"\\n\\nA few more questions were put, all of which were replied to in much the\\nsame strain by the coxswain, so as to make out my mother to be a very\\nimportant and mysterious personage.  It is true that Tommy Dott could\\nhave contradicted all this; but, in the first place, it was not very\\nlikely that there would be any communication upon the point between him\\nand the officers; and in the next I cautioned him to say nothing about\\nwhat he knew, which, as he was strongly attached to me, he strictly\\ncomplied with: so Bob Cross completely mystified the surgeon, who, of\\ncourse, made his report to his messmates.\\n\\nMr Culpepper\\'s report certainly differed somewhat from that of Bob\\nCross.  There was my statement of my aunt being married to a marine\\nofficer--but it was my statement; there was also my statement of my\\nmother residing with Captain Delmar\\'s aunt; altogether there was doubt\\nand mystery; and it ended in my mother being supposed to be a much\\ngreater person than she really was--everything tending to prove her a\\nlady of rank being willingly received, and all counter-statements looked\\nupon as apocryphal and false.\\n\\nBut whoever my mother might be, on one point every one agreed, which\\nwas, that I was the son of the Honourable Captain Delmar, and on this\\npoint I was equally convinced myself.  I waited with some anxiety for my\\nmother\\'s reply to my letter, which arrived two days after I had joined\\nthe frigate.  It was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"My dear Percival:--\\n\\n  \"You little know the pain and astonishment which I felt upon receipt\\n  of your very unkind and insulting letter; surely you could not have\\n  reflected at the time you wrote it, but must have penned it in a\\n  moment of irritation arising from some ungenerous remark which has\\n  been made in your hearing.\\n\\n  \"Alas, my dear child, you will find, now that you have commenced your\\n  career in life, that there are too many whose only pleasure is to\\n  inflict pain upon their fellow-creatures.  I only can imagine that\\n  some remark has been made in your presence, arising from there being a\\n  similarity of features between you and the Honourable Captain Delmar;\\n  that there is so has been before observed by others.  Indeed your\\n  uncle and aunt Bridgeman were both struck with the resemblance, when\\n  Captain Delmar arrived at Chatham; but this proves nothing, my dear\\n  child--people are very often alike, who have never seen each other, or\\n  heard each other mentioned, till they have by accident been thrown\\n  together so as to be compared.\\n\\n  \"It may certainly be, as your father was in the service of Captain\\n  Delmar, and constantly attended upon him, and indeed I may add as I\\n  was occasionally seeing him, that the impression of his countenance\\n  might be constantly in our memory, and--but you don\\'t understand such\\n  questions, and therefore I will say no more, except that you will\\n  immediately dismiss from your thoughts any such idea.\\n\\n  \"You forget, my dearest boy, that you are insulting me by supposing\\n  any such thing, and that your mother\\'s honour is called in question; I\\n  am sure you never thought of that when you wrote those hasty and\\n  inconsiderate lines.  I must add, my dear boy, that knowing Captain\\n  Delmar, and how proud and sensitive he is, if it should ever come to\\n  his knowledge that you had suspected or asserted what you have, his\\n  favour and protection would be lost to you for ever: at present he is\\n  doing a kind and charitable action in bringing forward the son of a\\n  faithful servant; but if he imagined for a moment that you were\\n  considered related to him he would cast you off for ever, and all your\\n  prospects in life would be ruined.\\n\\n  \"Even allowing it possible that you were what you so madly stated\\n  yourself in your letter to be, I am convinced he would do so.  If such\\n  a report came to his ears, he would immediately disavow you, and leave\\n  you to find your own way in the world.\\n\\n  \"You see, therefore, my dear boy, how injurious to you in every way\\n  such a ridiculous surmise must prove, and I trust that, not only for\\n  your own sake, but for your mother\\'s character, you will, so far from\\n  giving credence, indignantly disavow what must be a source of mischief\\n  and annoyance to all parties.\\n\\n  \"Captain Bridgeman desires me to say, that he is of my opinion, so is\\n  your aunt Milly: as for your grandmother, of course, I dare not show\\n  her your letter.  Write to me, my dear boy, and tell me how this\\n  unfortunate mistake happened, and believe me to be your affectionate\\n  mother, ARABELLA KEENE.\"\\n\\nI read this letter over ten times before I came to any conclusion; at\\nlast I said to myself, there is not in any one part of it any positive\\ndenial of the fact, and resolved some future day, when I had had some\\nconversation with Bob Cross, to show it to him, and ask his opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, at daylight, the blue Peter was hoisted at the\\nforemast, and the gun fired as a signal for sailing; all was bustle--\\nhoisting in, clearing boats of stock, and clearing the ship of women and\\nstrangers.\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock Captain Delmar made his appearance, the hands were piped\\nup anchor, and in half an hour we were standing out for St. Helen\\'s.\\nBefore night it blew very fresh, and we went rolling down the Channel\\nbefore an easterly wind.  I went to my hammock very sick, and did not\\nrecover for several days, during which nobody asked for me, or any\\nquestions about me, except Bob Cross and Tommy Dott.\\n\\nAs soon as I was well enough, I made my appearance on deck, and was\\nordered by the first lieutenant to do my duty under the signal\\nmidshipman: this was day duty, and not very irksome; I learnt the flags,\\nand how to use a spy-glass.\\n\\nWe were charged with despatches for the fleet, then off Cadiz, and on\\nthe tenth day we fell in with it, remained a week in company, and then\\nwere ordered to Gibraltar and Malta.  From Malta we went home again with\\ndespatches, having been out three months.\\n\\nDuring this short and pleasant run, I certainly did not learn much of my\\nprofession, but I did learn a little of the ways of the world.  First,\\nas to Captain Delmar, his conduct to me was anything but satisfactory;\\nhe never inquired for me during the time that I was unwell, and took no\\nnotice of me on my reappearance.\\n\\nThe officers and young gentlemen, as midshipmen are called, were asked\\nto dine in the cabin in rotation, and I did in consequence dine two or\\nthree times in the cabin; but it appeared to me, as if the captain\\npurposely took no notice of me, although he generally did say a word or\\ntwo to the others; moreover as the signal mids were up in the morning\\nwatch, he would occasionally send to invite one of the others to\\nbreakfast with him, but he never paid me that compliment.\\n\\nThis annoyed me, and I spoke of it to Bob Cross, with whom I had had\\nsome long conversations.  I had told him all I knew relative to myself,\\nwhat my suspicions were, and I had shown him my mother\\'s reply.  His\\nopinion on the subject may be given in what follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Master Keene, you are in an awkward position; the captain is a\\nvery proud man, and too proud to acknowledge that you are any way\\nrelated to him.  It\\'s my opinion, from what you have told me, and from\\nother reasons, particularly from your likeness to the captain, that your\\nsuspicions are correct; but, what then?  Your mother is sworn to\\nsecrecy--that\\'s clear; and the captain won\\'t own you--that\\'s also very\\nclear.  I had some talk with the captain\\'s steward on the subject when I\\nwas taking a glass of grog with him the other night in this berth.  It\\nwas he that brought up the subject, not me, and he said, that the\\ncaptain not asking you to breakfast, and avoiding you, as it were, was\\nanother proof that you belonged to him; and the wishing to hide the\\nsecret only makes him behave as he does.  You have a difficult game to\\nplay, Master Keene; but you are a clever lad, and you ask advice--mind\\nyou follow it, or it\\'s little use asking it.  You must always be very\\nrespectful to Captain Delmar, and keep yourself at as great a distance\\nfrom him as he does from you.\"\\n\\n\"That I\\'m sure I will,\" replied I, \"for I dislike him very much.\"\\n\\n\"No, you must not do that, but you must bend to circumstances; by-and-by\\nthings will go on better; but mind you keep on good terms with the\\nofficers, and never be saucy, or they may say to you what may not be\\npleasant; recollect this, and things will go on better, as I said\\nbefore.  If Captain Delmar protects you with his interest, you will be a\\ncaptain over the heads of many who are now your superiors on board of\\nthis frigate.  One thing be careful of, which is, to keep your own\\ncounsel, and don\\'t be persuaded in a moment of confidence to trust\\nanything to Tommy Dott, or any other midshipman; and if any one hints at\\nwhat you suppose, deny it immediately; nay, if necessary, fight for it--\\nthat will be the way to please the captain, for you will be of his side\\nthen, and not against him.\"\\n\\nThat this advice of Bob Cross was the best that could be given to one in\\nmy position there could not be a doubt; and that I did resolve to follow\\nit, is most certain.  I generally passed away a portion of my leisure\\nhours in Bob\\'s company, and became warmly attached to him; and certainly\\nmy time was not thrown away, for I learnt a great deal from him.\\n\\nOne evening, as I was leaning against one of the guns on the main deck,\\nwaiting for Cross to come out of the cabin, I was amused with the\\nfollowing conversation between a boatswain\\'s mate and a fore-top man.  I\\nshall give it verbatim.  They were talking of one that was dead; and\\nafter the boatswain\\'s mate had said--\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s in heaven, poor fellow.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause, the fore-top man said--\\n\\n\"I wonder, Bill, whether I shall ever go to heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" replied the boatswain\\'s mate.\\n\\n\"Why, the parson says it\\'s good works; now, I certainly have been a\\npretty many times in action, and I have killed plenty of Frenchmen in my\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s sufficient, I should think; I hold my hopes upon just the\\nsame claims.  I\\'ve cut down fifty Frenchmen in my life, and if that\\nain\\'t good works, I don\\'t know what is.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose Nelson\\'s in heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Of course; if so be he wishes to be there, I should like to know who\\nwould keep him out, if he was determined on it; no, no; depend upon it\\nhe walked _slap_ in.\"\\n\\nOn our return to Portsmouth, the captain went up to the Admiralty with\\nthe despatches, the frigate remaining at Spithead, ready to sail at a\\nmoment\\'s notice.\\n\\nI was now quite accustomed to the ship and officers; the conviction I\\nhad of my peculiar position, together with the advice of Bob Cross, had\\nvery much subdued my spirit; perhaps the respect created by discipline,\\nand the example of others, which produced in me a degree of awe of the\\ncaptain and the lieutenants, assisted a little--certain it is, that I\\ngained the goodwill of my messmates, and had not been in any scrape\\nduring the whole cruise.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant was a stern, but not unkind man; he would blow you\\nup, as we termed it, when he scolded for half an hour without ceasing.\\nI never knew a man with such a flow of words; but if permitted to go on\\nwithout interruption, he was content, without proceeding to further\\npunishment.  Any want of respect, however, was peculiarly offensive to\\nhim, and any attempt to excuse yourself was immediately cut short with,\\n\"No reply, sir.\"\\n\\nThe second day after our return to Spithead, I was sent on shore in the\\ncutter to bring off a youngster who was to join the ship; he had never\\nbeen to sea before; his name was Green, and he was as green as a\\ngooseberry.  I took a dislike to him the moment that I saw him, because\\nhe had a hooked nose and very small ferrety eyes.  As we were pulling on\\nboard he asked me a great many questions of all kinds, particularly\\nabout the captain and officers, and to amuse myself and the boat\\'s crew,\\nwho were on the full titter, I exercised my peculiar genius for\\ninvention.\\n\\nAt last, after I had given a character of the first lieutenant, which\\nmade him appear a sort of marine ogre, he asked how it was I got on with\\nhim:--\\n\\n\"O, very well,\" replied I; \"but I\\'m a freemason, and so is he, and he\\'s\\nnever severe with a brother mason.\"\\n\\n\"But how did he know you were a mason?\"\\n\\n\"I made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me,\\nand he left off almost immediately; that is, when I made the second\\nsign; he did not when I made the first.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to know these signs.  Won\\'t you tell them to me?\"\\n\\n\"Tell them to you! oh no, that won\\'t do,\" replied I.  \"I don\\'t know you.\\nHere we are on board--in bow,--rowed of all, men.  Now, Mr Green, I\\'ll\\nshow you the way up.\"\\n\\nMr Green was presented, and ushered into the service much in the same\\nway as I was; but he had not forgotten what I said to him relative to\\nthe first lieutenant; and it so happened that, on the third day he\\nwitnessed a jobation, delivered by the first lieutenant to one of the\\nmidshipmen, who, venturing to reply, was ordered to the mast-head for\\nthe remainder of the day; added to which, a few minutes afterwards, the\\nfirst lieutenant ordered two men to be put both legs in irons.  Mr\\nGreen trembled as he saw the men led away by the master-at-arms, and he\\ncame to me:\\n\\n\"I do wish, Keene, you would tell me those signs,\" said he; \"can\\'t you\\nbe persuaded to part with them?  I\\'ll give you any thing that I have\\nwhich you may like.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I should like to have that long spy-glass of yours, for\\nit\\'s a very good one; and, as signal-midshipman, will be useful to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will give it you with all my heart,\" replied he, \"if you will tell me\\nthe signs.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, come down below, give me the glass, and I will tell them to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nMr Green and I went down to the berth, and I received the spy-glass as\\na present in due form.  I then led him to my chest in the steerage, and\\nin a low, confidential tone, told him as follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Green, you must be very particular about making those signs,\\nfor if you make a mistake, you will be worse off than if you never made\\nthem at all, for the first lieutenant will suppose that you are trying\\nto persuade him that you are a mason, when you are not.  Now, observe,\\nyou must not attempt to make the first sign until he has scolded you\\nwell; then, at any pause, you must make it; thus, you see, you must put\\nyour thumb to the tip of your nose, and extend your hand straight out\\nfrom it, with all the fingers separated, as wide as you can.  Now, do it\\nas I did it.  Stop--wait a little, till that marine passes.  Yes, that\\nis it.  Well, that is considered the first proof of your being a mason,\\nbut it requires a second.  The first lieutenant will, I tell you\\nfrankly, be or rather pretend to be, in a terrible rage, and will\\ncontinue to rail at you; you must, therefore, wait a little till he\\npauses; and then, you observe, put up your thumb to your nose, with the\\nfingers of your hands spread out as before, and then add to it your\\nother hand, by joining your other thumb to the little finger of the hand\\nalready up, and stretch your other hand and fingers out like the first.\\nThen you will see the effects of the second sign.  Do you think you can\\nrecollect all this? for, as I said before, you must make no mistake.\"\\n\\nGreen put his hands up as I told him, and after three or four essays\\ndeclared himself perfect, and I left him.\\n\\nIt was about three days afterwards that Mr Green upset a kid of dirty\\nwater upon the lower deck which had been dry holystoned, and the mate of\\nthe lower deck, when the first lieutenant went his round, reported the\\ncircumstance to exculpate himself.  Mr Green was consequently summoned\\non the quarter-deck; and the first lieutenant, who was very angry,\\ncommenced, as usual, a volley of abuse on the unfortunate youngster.\\n\\nGreen, recollecting my instructions, waited till the first lieutenant\\nhad paused, and then made the first freemason sign, looking up very\\nboldly at the first lieutenant, who actually drew back with astonishment\\nat this contemptuous conduct, hitherto unwitnessed on board of a\\nman-at-war.\\n\\n\"What! sir,\" cried the first lieutenant.  \"Why, sir, are you mad?--you,\\njust come into the service, treating me in this manner!  I can tell you,\\nsir, that you will not be three days longer in the service--no, sir, not\\nthree days; for either you leave the service or I do.  Of all the\\nimpudence, of all the insolence, of all the contempt I have heard of,\\nthis beats all--and from such a little animal as you.  Consider yourself\\nas under an arrest, sir, till the captain comes on board, and your\\nconduct is reported; go down below, sir, immediately.\"\\n\\nThe lieutenant paused, and now Green gave him sign the second, as a\\nreply, thinking that they would then come to a right understanding--but\\nto his astonishment, the first lieutenant was more curious than ever;\\nand calling the sergeant of marines, ordered him to take Mr Green down,\\nand put him in irons, under the half-deck.\\n\\nPoor Green was handed down, all astonishment, at the want of success of\\nhis mason\\'s signs.  I, who stood abaft, was delighted at the success of\\nmy joke, while the first lieutenant walked hastily up and down the deck,\\nas much astonished as enraged at such insulting and insolent conduct\\nfrom a lad who had not been a week in the service.\\n\\nAfter a time the first lieutenant went down below, when Bob Cross, who\\nwas on deck, and who had perceived my delight at the scene, which was to\\nhim and all others so inexplicable, came up to me and said:--\\n\\n\"Master Keene, I\\'m sure, by your looks, you knew something about this.\\nThat foolish lad never had dared do so, if he knew what it was he had\\ndone.  Now, don\\'t look so demure, but tell me how it is.\"\\n\\nI walked aft with Bob Cross, and confided my secret to him; he laughed\\nheartily, and said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Tommy Dott did say that you were up to any thing, and so I think\\nyou are; but you see this is a very serious affair for poor Green, and,\\nlike the fable of the frogs, what is sport to you is death to others.\\nThe poor lad will be turned out of the service, and lose his chance of\\nbeing a post captain; so you must allow me to explain the matter so that\\nit gets to the ears of the first lieutenant as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied I, \"do as you like, Bob; if any one\\'s to be turned out\\nof the service for such nonsense, it ought to be me, and not Green, poor\\nsnob.\"\\n\\n\"No fear of your being turned out; the first lieutenant won\\'t like you\\nthe worse, and the other officers will like you better especially as I\\nshall say that it is by your wish that I explain all to get Mr Green\\nout of the scrape.  I\\'ll go to the surgeon and tell him--but, Master\\nKeene, don\\'t you call such matters _nonsense_, or you\\'ll find yourself\\nmistaken one of these days.  I never saw such disrespect on a\\nquarter-deck in all my life--worse than mutiny a thousand times.\"  Here\\nBob Cross burst out into a fit of laughter, as he recalled Green\\'s\\nextended fingers to his memory, and then he turned away and went down\\nbelow to speak to the surgeon.\\n\\nAs soon as Cross had quitted the deck, I could not restrain my curiosity\\nas to the situation of my friend Green; I therefore went down the ladder\\nto the half-deck, and there, on the starboard side between the guns, I\\nperceived the poor fellow, with his legs in irons, his hands firmly\\nclasped together, looking so woeful and woe-begone, every now and then\\nraising his eyes up to the beam of the upper deck, as if he would appeal\\nto heaven, that I scarcely could refrain from laughing.  I went up to\\nhim and said:--\\n\\n\"Why, Green, how is all this?--what has happened?\"\\n\\n\"Happened?\" said the poor fellow; \"happened? see what has happened; here\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"Did you make the freemason\\'s signs?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I?  Yes--I did: Oh, what will become of me?\"\\n\\n\"You could not have made them right; you must have forgotten them.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I made them as you told me; I\\'m quite sure of that.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps I did not recollect them exactly myself: however, be of\\ngood heart; I will have the whole matter explained to the first\\nlieutenant.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do; only get me out of this.  I don\\'t want the glass back.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have it done directly,\" replied I.\\n\\nAs I went away, Bob Cross came up, and said I was wanted by the first\\nlieutenant in the gun-room.  \"Don\\'t be afraid,\" said he: \"they\\'ve been\\nlaughing at it already, and the first lieutenant is it a capital humour;\\nstill he\\'ll serve you out well; you must expect that.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I make him the sign, Cross?\" replied I, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no; you\\'ve gone far enough, and too far already; mind what I say to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nI went down into the gun-room, when a tittering ceased as the sentry\\nopened the door, and I walked in.\\n\\n\"Did you want me, sir?\" said I to the first lieutenant, touching my hat,\\nand looking very demure.\\n\\n\"So, Mr Keene, I understand it was you who have been practising upon\\nMr Green, and teaching him insult and disrespect to his superior\\nofficers on the quarter-deck.  Well, sir?\"\\n\\nI made no reply, but appeared very penitent.\\n\\n\"Because a boy has just come to sea, and is ignorant of his profession,\\nit appears to be a custom--which I shall take care shall not be followed\\nup--to play him all manner of tricks, and tell him all manner of\\nfalsehoods.  Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Green and I have both just come to sea, sir, and the midshipmen all\\nplay us so many tricks,\" replied I, humbly, \"that I hardly know whether\\nwhat I do is right or wrong.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir, it was you who played this trick to Mr Green.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I told him so for fun, but I didn\\'t think he was such a fool\\nas to believe me.  I only said that you were a freemason, and that\\nfreemasons were kind to each other, and that you gave one another signs\\nto know one another by; I heard you say you were a freemason, sir, when\\nI dined in the gun-room.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I did say so; but that is no reason for your teaching him to\\nbe impudent.\"\\n\\n\"He asked me for the signs, sir, and I didn\\'t know them exactly; so I\\ngave him the signs that Mr Dott and I always make between us.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Dott and you--a pretty pair, as I said before.  I\\'ve a great mind\\nto put you in Mr Green\\'s place--at all events, I shall report your\\nconduct when the captain comes from London.  There, sir, you may go.\"\\n\\nI put on a penitent face as I went out wiping my eyes with the back of\\nmy hands.  After I went out, I waited a few seconds at the gun-room\\ndoor, and then the officers, supposing that I was out of hearing, gave\\nvent to their mirth, the first lieutenant laughing the loudest.\\n\\n\"Cross is right,\" thought I, as I went up the ladder; a minute\\nafterwards, Mr Green was set free, and, after a severe reprimand, was\\nallowed to return to his duty.\\n\\n\"You are well out of that trick, my hearty,\" said Bob Cross; \"the first\\nlieutenant won\\'t say a word to the captain, never fear; but don\\'t try it\\nagain.\"\\n\\nBut an event occurred a few hours afterwards which might have been\\nattended with more serious consequences.  The ship was, during the day,\\nsurrounded by shore boats of all descriptions, containing Jews, sailors\\'\\nwives, and many other parties, who wished to have admittance on board.\\nIt was almost dusk, the tide was running strong flood, and the wind was\\nvery fresh, so that there was a good deal of sea.  All the boats had\\nbeen ordered to keep off by the first lieutenant, but they still\\nlingered, in hope of getting on board.\\n\\nI was looking over the stern, and perceived that the boat belonging to\\nthe bumboat woman, who was on board of the ship, was lying with her\\npainter fast to the stern ladder; the waterman was in her, as well as\\none of the sailors\\' wives, who had left her own wherry in hopes of\\ngetting on board when the waterman went alongside to take in the\\narticles not sold, when the bumboat woman left the ship, which would be\\nin a few minutes, as it was nearly gun-fire for sunset.  The waterman,\\nwho thought it time to haul alongside, and wished to communicate with\\nhis employer on board, was climbing up by the stern ladder.\\n\\n\"That\\'s against orders, you know,\" cried I to the man.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; but it is so rough, that the boat would be swamped if it were\\nto remain alongside long, and I hope you won\\'t order me down again;\\nthere\\'s some nice cakes in the boat, sir, just under the stern sheets,\\nif you would like to have them, and think it worth while to go down for\\nthem.\"\\n\\nThis was a bribe, and I replied, \"No, I don\\'t want your cakes, but you\\nmay come up.\"\\n\\nThe man thanked me, and walked forward as soon as he had gained the\\ndeck.  On second thoughts, I determined that I would have the cakes; so\\nI descended by the stern ladder, and desiring the woman who was left in\\nthe boat to haul upon the rope, contrived to get into the boat.\\n\\n\"What is it you want, my dear?\" said the woman.\\n\\n\"I come for some of those cakes under the stern sheets,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll soon rummage them out,\" said she, \"and I hope you will let\\nme slip on board when the boat is alongside.  Mind, sir, how you step,\\nyou\\'ll smash all the pipes.  Give me your hand.  I\\'m an old sailor.\"\\n\\n\"I should not think so,\" replied I, looking at her.  I could hardly make\\nout her face, but her form was small, and, if an old sailor, she\\ncertainly was a very young woman.\\n\\nWe had a good many articles to remove before we could get at the cakes,\\nwhich were under the stern sheets; and the boat rocked and tossed so\\nviolently with the sea which was running, that we were both on our knees\\nfor some little while before we obtained the basket: when we did, to our\\nsurprise, we found that the boat\\'s painter, somehow or another, had\\nloosened, and that during our search we had drifted nearly one hundred\\nyards from the ship.\\n\\n\"Mercy on me!--why, we are adrift,\" exclaimed the woman.  \"What shall we\\ndo?  It\\'s no use hailing, they\\'ll never hear us; look well round for any\\nboat you may see.\"\\n\\n\"It is getting so dark that we shall not see far,\" replied I, not much\\nliking our position.  \"Where shall we go to?\"\\n\\n\"Go to!--clean out to St. Helen\\'s, if the boat does not fill before we\\nget there; and further than that too, if I mistake not, with this gale\\nof wind.  We may as well say our prayers, youngster, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we make sail upon her?\" replied I.  \"Can\\'t we try and pull on\\nshore somewhere?  Had we not better do that, and say our prayers\\nafterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Well said, my little bantam,\" replied the woman: \"you would have made a\\ngood officer if you had been spared; but the fact is, boy, that we can\\ndo nothing with the oars in this heavy sea; and as for the sail, how can\\nyou and I step the mast, rolling and tossing about in this way?  If the\\nmast were stepped, and the sail set, I think I could manage to steer, if\\nthe weather was smoother, but not in this bubble and this gale; it\\nrequires older hands than either you or I.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, we must sit still and trust to our luck, bale out the boat, and\\nkeep her from swamping as long as we can, and between times we may cry,\\nor we may pray, or we may eat the cakes and red herrings, or the soft\\nbread and other articles in the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s bale the boat out first,\" said I, \"for she\\'s half full of water;\\nthen we\\'ll have something to eat, for I feel hungry and cold already,\\nand then we may as well say our prayers.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I tell you what, we\\'ll have something to drink, too, for I\\nhave a drop for Jem, if I could have got on board.  I promised it to\\nhim, poor fellow, but it\\'s no use keeping it now, for I expect we\\'ll\\nboth be in Davy\\'s locker before morning.\"\\n\\nThe woman took out from where it was secreted in her dress, a bladder\\ncontaining spirits; she opened the mouth of it, and poured out a portion\\ninto one of the milk-cans; having drunk herself, she handed it to me,\\nbut not feeling inclined, and being averse to spirits, I rejected it,\\n\"Not just now,\" said I, \"by-and-by perhaps.\"\\n\\nDuring the time of this conversation we were swept by a strong tide and\\nstrong wind right out of the anchorage at Spithead; the sea was very\\nhigh, and dashed into the boat, so that I was continually baling to keep\\nit free; the night was as dark as pitch; we could see nothing except the\\nlights of the vessels which we had left far away from us, and they were\\nnow but as little twinkles as we rose upon the waves.  The wind roared,\\nand there was every appearance of a heavy gale.\\n\\n\"Little hopes of our weathering this storm,\" said the woman; \"we shall\\nsoon be swamped if we do not put her before the wind.  I\\'ll see if I\\ncannot find the lines.\"\\n\\nShe did so after a time, and by means of a rudder put the boat before\\nthe wind; the boat then took in much less water, but ran at a swift rate\\nthrough the heavy sea.\\n\\n\"There, we shall do better now; out to sea we go, that\\'s clear,\" said\\nthe woman; \"and before daylight we shall be in the Channel, if we do not\\nfill and go down; and then, the Lord have mercy upon us, that\\'s all!\\nWon\\'t you take a drop?\" continued she, pouring out some spirits into the\\ncan.\\n\\nAs I felt very cold, I did not this time refuse.  I drank a small\\nquantity of the spirits; the woman took off the remainder, which, with\\nwhat she had previously drunk, began to have an effect upon her.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my little Trojan,\" said she, and she commenced singing.\\n\"A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether; in spite of wind and\\nweather, boys, in spite of wind and weather.  Poor Jem,\" continued she,\\n\"he\\'ll be disappointed; he made sure of being glorious to-night, and I\\nmade sure to sleep by his side--now he\\'ll be quite sober--and I\\'ll be\\nfood for fishes; it\\'s a cold bed that I shall turn into before morning,\\nthat\\'s certain.  Hand me the cakes, boy, if you can fumble them out; the\\nmore we fill ourselves, the less room for salt water.  Well, then, wind\\nand waves are great bullies; they fly slap back in a fright when they\\nbang against a great ship; but when they get hold of a little boat like\\nthis, how they leap and topple in, as if they made sure of us [here a\\nwave dashed into the boat].  Yes, that\\'s your sort.  Come along, swamp a\\nlittle boat you washy cowards, it\\'s only a woman and a boy.  Poor Jim,\\nhe\\'ll miss me something, but he\\'ll miss the liquor more; who cares?\\nLet\\'s have another drop.\"\\n\\n\"Give me the lines, then,\" said I, as I perceived she was letting them\\ngo, \"or we shall be broadside to the waves again.\"\\n\\nI took the rudder lines from her, and steered the boat, while she again\\nresorted to the bladder of spirits.\\n\\n\"Take another sip,\" said she, after she had filled the milk-can; \"it\\nwon\\'t harm you.\"\\n\\nI thought the same, for I was wet through, and the wind, as it howled,\\npierced me to the bones; I took a small quantity as before, and then\\ncontinued to keep the boat before the wind.  The sea was increasing very\\nmuch and although no sailor, I felt fully convinced that the boat could\\nnot live much longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime the woman was becoming intoxicated very fast.  I knew\\nthe consequence of this, and requested her to bale out the boat: she did\\nso, and sang a mournful sort of song as she baled, but the howling of\\nthe wind prevented me from distinguishing the words.\\n\\nI cannot well analyse my feelings at this time--they were confused; but\\nthis I know, self-preservation and hope were the most predominant.  I\\nthought of my mother, of my aunt, of Captain Bridgeman, Captain Delmar,\\nand Bob Cross; but my thoughts were as rapid as the gale which bore us\\nalong, and I was too much employed in steering the boat, and preventing\\nthe seas from filling it, to have a moment to collect my ideas.\\n\\nAgain the woman applied to the bladder of spirits, and offered some to\\nme; I refused.  I had had enough, and by this time she had had too much,\\nand after an attempt to bale she dropped down in the stern sheets,\\nsmashing pipes and everything beneath her, and spoke no more.\\n\\nWe had now been more than four hours adrift; the wind was as strong as\\never, and, I thought, the sea much higher; but I kept the boat steady\\nbefore the wind, and by degrees, as I became more accustomed to steer,\\nshe did not take in so much water; still the boat appeared to be sinking\\ndeeper down, and after a time I considered it necessary to bale her out.\\nI did so with my hat, for I found it was half full of water; and then I\\nexecrated the woman for having intoxicated herself, so as to be useless\\nin such an emergency.\\n\\nI succeeded in clearing the boat of the major portion of the water,\\nwhich was no easy task, as the boat, having remained broadside to the\\nwind, had taken in the sea continually as I baled it out.  I then once\\nmore resumed the helm, and put the boat before the wind, and thus did I\\ncontinue for two hours more, when the rain came down in torrents, and\\nthe storm was wilder than ever, but a Portsmouth wherry is one of the\\nbest boats ever built, and so it proved in this instance.  Still I was\\nnow in a situation most trying for a lad between fourteen and fifteen;\\nmy teeth chattered with the cold, and I was drenched through and\\nthrough; the darkness was opaque, and I could see nothing but the white\\nfoam of the waves, which curled and broke close to the gunwale of the\\nboat.\\n\\nAt one moment I despaired, and looked for immediate death; but my\\nbuoyant spirit raised me up again, and I hoped.  It would be daylight in\\na few hours, and oh! how I looked and longed for daylight.  I knew I\\nmust keep the boat before the wind; I did so, but the seas were worse\\nthan ever; they now continually broke into the boat, for the tide had\\nturned, which had increased the swell.\\n\\nAgain I left the helm and bailed out; I was cold and faint, and I felt\\nrecovered with the exertion; I also tried to rouse the woman, but it was\\nuseless.  I felt for her bladder of liquor, and found it in her bosom,\\nmore than half empty.  I drank more freely, and my spirits and my\\ncourage revived.  After that, I ate, and steered the boat, awaiting the\\ncoming daylight.\\n\\nIt came at last slowly--so slowly; but it did come, and I felt almost\\nhappy.  There is such a horror in darkness when added to danger; I felt\\nas if I could have worshipped the sun as it rose slowly, and with a\\nwatery appearance, above the horizon.  I looked around me: there was\\nsomething like land astern of us, such as I had seen pointed out as land\\nby Bob Cross, when off the coast of Portugal; and so it was--it was the\\nIsle of Wight: for the wind had changed when the rain came down, and I\\nhad altered the course of the boat so that for the last four hours I had\\nbeen steering for the coast of France.\\n\\nBut, although I was cold and shivering, and worn out with watching, and\\ntired with holding the lines by which the wherry was steered, I felt\\nalmost happy at the return of day.  I looked down upon my companion in\\nthe boat; she lay sound asleep, with her head upon the basket of tobacco\\npipes, her bonnet wet and dripping, with its faded ribbons hanging in\\nthe water which washed to and fro at the bottom of the boat, as it\\nrolled and rocked to the motion of the waves; her hair had fallen over\\nher face, so as almost to conceal her features; I thought that she had\\ndied during the night, so silent and so breathless did she lie.  The\\nwaves were not so rough now as they had been, for the flood tide had\\nagain made; and as the beams of the morning sun glanced on the water,\\nthe same billows which appeared so dreadful in the darkness appeared to\\ndance merrily.\\n\\nI felt hungry; I took up a red herring from one of the baskets, and tore\\nit to pieces with my teeth.  I looked around me in every quarter to see\\nif there was any vessel in sight, but there was nothing to be seen but\\nnow and then a screaming sea-gull.  I tried to rouse my companion by\\nkicking her with my foot; I did not succeed in waking her up, but she\\nturned round on her back, and, her hair falling from her face,\\ndiscovered the features of a young and pretty person, apparently not\\nmore than nineteen or twenty years old; her figure was slight and well\\nformed.\\n\\nYoung as I was, I thought it a pity that such a nice-looking person--for\\nshe still was so, although in a state of disorder, and very dirty--\\nshould be so debased by intoxication; and as I looked at the bladder,\\nstill half full of spirits I seized it with an intention to throw it\\noverboard, when I paused at the recollection that it had probably saved\\nmy life during the night, and might yet be required.\\n\\nI did not like to alter the course of the boat, although I perceived\\nthat we were running fast from the land; for although the sea had gone\\ndown considerably, there was still too much for the boat to be put\\nbroadside to it.  I cannot say that I was unhappy; I found my situation\\nso very much improved to what it was during the darkness of the night.\\nThe sun shone bright, and I felt its warmth.  I had no idea of being\\nlost--death did not enter my thoughts.  There was plenty to eat, and\\nsome vessel would certainly pick us up.  Nevertheless, I said my\\nprayers, more devoutly than I usually did.\\n\\nAbout noon, as near as I could guess, the tide changed again, and as the\\nwind had lulled very much, there was little or no swell.  I thought\\nthat, now that the motion was not so great, we might possibly ship the\\nforemast and make some little sail upon the boat; and I tried again more\\nearnestly to rouse up my companion; after a few not very polite\\nattempts, I succeeded in ascertaining that she was alive.\\n\\n\"Be quiet, Jim,\" said she, with her eyes still closed; \"it\\'s not five\\nbells yet.\"\\n\\nAnother kick or two, and she turned herself round and stared wildly.\\n\\n\"Jim,\" said she, rubbing her eyes, and then she looked about her, and at\\nonce she appeared to remember what had passed; she shrieked, and covered\\nher face up with her hands.\\n\\n\"I thought it was a dream, and was going to tell Jim all about it, at\\nbreakfast,\" said she, sorrowfully, \"but it\\'s all true--true as gospel.\\nWhat will become of me?  We are lost, lost, lost!\"\\n\\n\"We are not lost, but we should have been lost this night if I had been\\nas drunk as you have been,\" replied I; \"I\\'ve had work enough to keep the\\nboat above water, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s truth,\" replied she, rising up and taking a seat upon the thwart\\nof the boat.  \"God, forgive me, poor wretch that I am: what will Jim\\nthink, and what will he say, when he sees my best bonnet in such a\\npickle?\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure that you\\'ll ever see Jim again, or that you\\'ll ever\\nwant your best bonnet?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true.  If one\\'s body is to be tossed about by green waves, it\\'s\\nlittle matter whether there\\'s a bonnet or shawl on.  Where are we, do\\nyou know?\"\\n\\n\"I can just see the land out there,\" replied I, pointing astern.  \"The\\nsea is smooth; I think we could ship the foremast, and get sail upon\\nher.\"\\n\\nThe young woman stood up in the boat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"I\\'m pretty steady; I think we could.  Last night in\\nthe dark and the tossing sea I could do nothing, but now I can.  What a\\nblessing is daylight to cowards like me--I am only afraid in the dark.\\nWe must put some sail upon the boat, or nobody will see us.  What did\\nyou do with the bladder of liquor?\"\\n\\n\"Threw it overboard,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Had you courage to do that?--and watching through the the night so wet\\nand cold.  Well you did right--I could not have done it.  Oh! that\\nliquor--that liquor; I wish there wasn\\'t such a thing in the world, but\\nit\\'s too late now.  When I first married James Pearson, and the garland\\nwas hung to the main-stay of the frigate, nobody could persuade me to\\ntouch it, not even James himself, whom I loved so much.  Instead of\\nquarrelling with me for not drinking it, as he used to do, he now\\nquarrels with me for drinking the most.  If you\\'ll come forward, sir,\\nand help me, we\\'ll soon get up the foremast.  This is it, you see, with\\nthe jib passed round it.  Jim often says that I\\'d make a capital sailor,\\nif I\\'d only enter in man\\'s clothes--but as I tell him, I should be put\\nup at the gangway, for not being sober, before I\\'d been on board a\\nweek.\"\\n\\nWe contrived to ship the mast, and set the jib and foresail.  As soon as\\nthe sheets were hauled aft, my companion took the steering lines,\\nsaying, \"I know how to manage her well enough, now it\\'s daylight, and\\nI\\'m quite sober.  You must be very tired, sir; so sit down on the\\nthwart, or lie down if you please, and take a nap; all\\'s safe enough\\nnow--see, we lie up well for the land;\" and such was the case, for she\\nhad brought the boat to the wind, and we skimmed over the waves at the\\nrate of three or four miles an hour.  I had no inclination to sleep; I\\nbaled the boat out thoroughly, and put the baskets and boxes into some\\nkind of order.  I then sat down on the thwarts, first looking round for\\na vessel in sight; but seeing none, I entered into conversation with my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Peggy Pearson; I have my marriage lines to show: they can throw nothing\\nin my face, except that I\\'m fond of liquor, God forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"And what makes you so fond of it now, since you say that, when you were\\nmarried, you did not care for it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well say that: it all came of _sipping_.  James would have me\\non his knee, and would insist on my taking a sip; and to please him I\\ndid, although it made me almost sick at first, and then after a while I\\ndid not mind it; and then, you see, when I was waiting at the sallyport\\nwith the other women, the wind blowing fresh, and the spray wetting us\\nas we stood on the shingle with our arms wrapped up in our aprons,\\nlooking out for a boat from the ship to come on shore, they would have a\\nquartern, and make me take a drop; and so it went on.  Then James made\\nme bring him liquor on board, and I drank some with him; but what\\nfinished me was, that I heard something about James when he was at\\nPlymouth, which made me jealous, and then for the first time I got\\ntipsy.  After that, it was all over with me; but, as I said before, it\\nbegan with sipping--worse luck, but it\\'s done now.  Tell me what has\\npassed during the night.  Has the weather been very bad?\"\\n\\nI told her what had occurred, and how I had kicked her to wake her up.\\n\\n\"Well, I deserved more than kicking, and you\\'re a fine, brave fellow;\\nand if we get on board the Calliope again--and I trust to God we shall--\\nI\\'ll take care to blow the trumpet for you as you deserve.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any one to blow the trumpet for me,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you be proud; a good word from me may be of use to you and it\\'s\\nwhat you deserve.  The ship\\'s company will think highly of you, I can\\ntell you.  A good name is of no small value--a captain has found out\\nthat before now; you\\'re only a lad, but you\\'re a regular trump, and the\\nseamen shall all know it, and the officers too.\"\\n\\n\"We must get on board the ship first,\" replied I, \"and we are a long way\\nfrom it just now.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re all right, and I have no fear.  If we don\\'t see a vessel we shall\\nfetch the land somewhere before to-morrow morning, and it don\\'t look as\\nif there would be any more bad weather.  I wonder if they have sent\\nanything out to look after us?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said I, pointing astern, \"it\\'s a sail of some kind.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Peggy, \"so it is; it\\'s a square-rigged vessel coming up the\\nChannel--we had better get on the other tack, and steer for her.\"\\n\\nWe wore the boat round and ran in the direction of the vessel; in three\\nhours we were close to her; I hailed her as she came down upon us but no\\none appeared to hear us or see us, for she had lower studding-sails set,\\nand there was no one forward.  We hailed again, and the vessel was now\\nwithin twenty yards, and we were right across her bows; a man came\\nforward, and cried out, \"Starboard your helm,\" but not in sufficient\\ntime to prevent the vessel from striking the wherry, and to stave her\\nquarter in; we dropped alongside as the wherry filled with water, and we\\nwere hauled in by the seamen over the gunwale, just as she turned over\\nand floated away astern.\\n\\n\"Touch and go, my lad,\" said one of the seamen who had hauled me on\\nboard.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you keep a better look out?\" said Peggy Pearson, shaking her\\npetticoats, which were wet up to the knees.  \"Paint eyes in the bows of\\nyour brig, if you haven\\'t any yourself.  Now you\\'ve lost a boatful of\\nred-herrings, eggs, and soft tommy--no bad things after a long cruise;\\nwe meant to have paid our passage with them--now you must take us for\\nnothing.\"\\n\\nThe master of the vessel, who was on deck, observed that I was in the\\nuniform of an officer.  He asked me how it was we were found in such a\\nsituation?  I narrated what had passed in few words.  He said that he\\nwas from Cadiz bound to London, and that he would put us on shore at any\\nplace up the river I would like, but that he could not lose the chance\\nof the fair wind to land me anywhere else.\\n\\nI was too thankful to be landed anywhere; and telling him that I should\\nbe very glad if he could put me on shore at Sheerness, which was the\\nnearest place to Chatham, I asked leave to turn into one of the cabin\\nbed-places, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that I had been seen by the sentry abaft to\\ngo down by the stern ladder into the boat, and when the waterman came\\nback shortly afterwards to haul his boat up, and perceived that it had\\ngone adrift, there was much alarm on my account.  It was too dark to\\nsend a boat after us that night, but the next morning the case was\\nreported to the admiral of the port, who directed a cutter to get under\\nweigh and look for us.\\n\\nThe cutter had kept close in shore for the first day, and it was on the\\nmorning after I was picked up by the brig, that, in standing more out,\\nshe had fallen in with the wherry, bottom up.  This satisfied them that\\nwe had perished in the rough night, and it was so reported to the\\nport-admiral and to Captain Delmar, who had just come down from London.\\n\\nI slept soundly till the next morning, when I found that the wind had\\nfallen and that it was nearly calm.  Peggy Pearson was on deck; she had\\nwashed herself and smoothed out with an iron the ribbons of her bonnet,\\nand was really a very handsome young woman.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said she, \"I didn\\'t know your name before you told it to\\nthe skipper here; you\\'re in a pretty scrape.  I don\\'t know what Jim\\nPearson will say when you go back, running away with his wife as you\\nhave done.  Don\\'t you think I had better go back first, and smooth\\nthings over.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you laugh now,\" replied I; \"but you didn\\'t laugh the night we went\\nadrift.\"\\n\\n\"Because it was no laughing matter.  I owe my life to you, and if I had\\nbeen adrift by myself, I should never have put my foot on shore again.\\nDo you know,\" said she to me, very solemnly, \"I\\'ve made a vow--yes, a\\nvow to Heaven, that I\\'ll leave off drinking; and I only hope I may have\\nstrength given me to keep it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you keep it?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think I can; for when I reflect that I might have gone to my account\\nin that state, I really feel a horror of liquor.  If James would only\\ngive it up, I\\'m sure I could.  I swear that I never will bring him any\\nmore on board--that\\'s settled.  He may scold me, he may beat me (I don\\'t\\nthink he would do that, for he never has yet); but let him do what he\\npleases, I never will; and if he keeps sober because he hasn\\'t the means\\nof getting tipsy, I am sure that I shall keep my vow.  You don\\'t know\\nhow I hate myself; and although I\\'m merry, it\\'s only to prevent my\\nsitting down and crying like a child at my folly and wickedness in\\nyielding to temptation.\"\\n\\n\"I little thought to hear this from you.  When I was with you in the\\nboat, I thought you a very different person.\"\\n\\n\"A woman who drinks, Mr Keene, is lost to everything.  I\\'ve often\\nthought of it, after I\\'ve become sober again.  Five years ago I was the\\nbest girl in the school.  I was the monitor and wore a medal for good\\nconduct.  I thought that I should be so happy with James; I loved him\\nso, and do so still.  I knew that he was fond of liquor, but I never\\nthought that he would make me drink.  I thought then that I should cure\\nhim, and with the help of God I will now; not only him, but myself too.\"\\n\\nAnd I will here state that Peggy Pearson, whose only fault was the\\npassion she had imbibed for drinking, did keep her vow; the difficulty\\nof which few can understand who have not been intemperate themselves;\\nand she not only continued sober herself, but by degrees broke her\\nhusband of his similar propensity to liquor.\\n\\nIt was not till the evening of the fourth that we arrived at the Nore.\\nI had four pounds in my pocket at the time that I went adrift, which was\\nmore than sufficient, even if I had not intended to go and see my\\nmother.  A wherry came alongside, and Peggy Pearson and I stepped into\\nit, after I had thanked the captain, and given a sovereign to the seamen\\nto drink my health.\\n\\nAs soon as we landed at Sheerness I gave another of my sovereigns to\\nPeggy, and left her to find her way back to Portsmouth, while I walked\\nup to Chatham to my mother\\'s house.\\n\\nIt was past eight o\\'clock and quite dark when I arrived; the shop was\\nclosed, and the shutters up at the front door; so I went round to the\\nback to obtain admittance.  The door was not fast, and I walked into the\\nlittle parlour without meeting with anybody.  I heard somebody upstairs,\\nand I thought I heard sobbing; it then struck me that my supposed loss\\nmight have been communicated to my mother.  There was a light on the\\nparlour table, and I perceived an open letter lying near to it.  I\\nlooked at it; it was the handwriting of Captain Delmar.  The candle\\nrequired snuffing; I raised the letter to the light that I might read\\nit, and read as follows:--\\n\\n  \"MY DEAR ARABELLA:--\\n\\n  \"You must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings, and it is most\\n  painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them.\\n  A dreadful accident has occurred, and indeed I feel most sincerely for\\n  you.  On the night of the 10th, Percival was in a boat which broke\\n  adrift from the ship in a gale of wind; it was dark, and the fact not\\n  known until too late to render any assistance.\\n\\n  \"The next day a cutter was despatched by the admiral to look for the\\n  boat, which must have been driven out to sea; there was a woman in the\\n  boat as well as _our_ poor boy.  Alas!  I regret to say that the boat\\n  was found bottom up, and there is no doubt but that _our_ dear child\\n  has perished.\\n\\n  \"You will believe me when I say that I deeply lament his loss; not\\n  only on your account, but because I had become most partial to him for\\n  his many good qualities, and often have I regretted that his peculiar\\n  position prevented me from showing him openly that regard which, as\\n  _his father_, I really felt for him.\\n\\n  \"I know that I can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings,\\n  and yet I fain would, for you have been so true, and anxious to please\\n  me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy, that\\n  there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands.\\n\\n  \"Comfort yourself, dear Arabella, as well as you can with the\\n  reflection that it has been the will of Heaven, to whose decrees we\\n  must submit with resignation.  I am deeply suffering myself; for, had\\n  he lived, I swear to you that I intended to do much more for him than\\n  ever I had promised you.  He would have made a good and gallant sailor\\n  had it pleased Heaven to spare him, and you would have been proud of\\n  him; but it has been decided otherwise, and we must bow in obedience\\n  to His will.  God bless you, and support you in your afflictions, and\\n  believe me still,\\n\\n  \"Yours, most sincerely and faithfully,\\n\\n  \"PERCIVAL DELMAR.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is so,\" thought I; \"here I have it under his own hand.\"  I\\nimmediately folded up the letter, and put it into my bosom.  \"You and I\\nnever part, that is certain,\" murmured I.  I had almost lost my breath\\nfrom emotion, and I sat down to recover myself.  After a minute or two I\\npulled the letter out and read it over again.  \"And he is my father, and\\nhe loves me, but dare not show it, and he intended to do more for me\\nthan even he had promised my mother.\"\\n\\nI folded up the letter, kissed it fervently, and replaced it in my\\nbosom.  \"Now,\" thought I, \"what shall I do?  This letter will be\\nrequired of me by my mother, but never shall she get it; not tears, nor\\nthreats, nor entreaties shall ever induce me to part with it.  What\\nshall I do?  Nobody has seen me--nobody knows that I have been here.  I\\nwill go directly and join my ship; yes, that will be my best plan.\"\\n\\nI was so occupied with my own reverie, that I did not perceive a\\nfootstep on the stairs, until the party was so far down that I could not\\nretreat.  I thought to hide myself.  I knew by the list shoes that it\\nmust be my grandmother.  A moment of reflection.  I blew out the light\\non the table, and put myself in an attitude: one arm raised aloft, the\\nother extended from my body, and with my mouth wide open and my eyes\\nfixed, I awaited her approach.  She came in--saw me--uttered a fearful\\nshriek, and fell senseless on the floor; the candle in her hand was\\nextinguished in the fall: I stepped over her body; and darting out into\\nthe back-yard, gained the door, and was in the street in a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\\n\\nI was soon in the high road, and clear of the town of Chatham.  As my\\nobject was that it should not be supposed that I had been there, I made\\nall the haste I could to increase my distance; I therefore walked on in\\nthe direction of Gravesend, where I arrived about ten o\\'clock.  A return\\nchaise offered to take me to Greenwich for a few shillings, and before\\nmorning dawned I had gained the metropolis.\\n\\nI lost no time in inquiring when the coaches started for Portsmouth, and\\nfound that I was in plenty of time, as one set off at nine o\\'clock.\\n\\nMuch as I wished to see London, my curiosity gave way to what I\\nconsidered the necessity of my immediate return to the frigate.  At\\nseven o\\'clock in the evening I arrived at Portsmouth; I hastened down,\\njumped into a wherry, and was on board of the frigate again by eight.\\n\\nIt may be imagined that my sudden and unexpected appearance caused no\\nlittle surprise.  Indeed, the first lieutenant considered it right to\\nsend the gig on shore at that late hour to apprise the captain of my\\nreturn, and Bob Cross had just time to give me a wring of the hand\\nbefore he jumped into the boat, and went away to make the report.\\n\\nI gave a history of my adventures to the officers, leaving them,\\nhowever, to suppose that I had never been to Chatham, but had gone up to\\nLondon in the merchant vessel.\\n\\nPearson, the boatswain\\'s mate, came to make inquiries about his wife;\\nand, soon after, Bob Cross came on board with the captain\\'s orders, that\\nI should go on shore to him in the gig on the following morning.\\n\\nI wished very much to consult Bob Cross previous to my seeing the\\ncaptain.  I told him so, and he agreed to meet me on the gangway about\\nten o\\'clock, as by that time the officers would be almost all in bed,\\nand there would be less chance of interruption.\\n\\nIt was a fine, clear night, and as soon as we found ourselves alone I\\nnarrated to him, in a low voice, all that had taken place, and gave him\\nthe contents of the letter which I had taken possession of.  I then\\nasked him what he thought I ought to do, now that I was certain of being\\nthe son of the captain.\\n\\n\"Why, Master Keene, you have done it very cleverly, that\\'s the truth;\\nand that letter, which is as good as a certificate from Captain Delmar,\\nmust be taken great care of.  I hardly know where it ought to be put,\\nbut I think the best thing will be for me to sew it in a seal-skin pouch\\nthat I have, and then you can wear it round your neck, and next your\\nskin; for, as you say, you and that must never part company.  But,\\nMaster Keene, you must be silent as death about it.  You have told me,\\nand I hope I may be trusted, but trust nobody else.  As to saying or\\nhinting anything to the captain, you mustn\\'t think of it; you must go on\\nas before, as if you knew nothing, for if he thought you had the letter\\nin your possession he would forget you were his son, and perhaps hate\\nyou.  He never would have been induced to acknowledge you under his own\\nhand as his son had he not thought that you were dead and gone, as\\neverybody else did; so behave just as respectful and distant as before.\\nIt\\'s only in some great emergency that that letter will do you any good,\\nand you must reserve it in case of need.  If your mother is suspicious,\\nwhy, you must blind her.  Your granny will swear that it was your ghost;\\nyour mother may think otherwise, but cannot prove it; she dare not tell\\nthe captain that she suspects you have the letter, and it will all blow\\nover after a cruise or two.\"\\n\\nI agreed to follow the advice of Bob Cross, as I saw it was good, and we\\nparted for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning I went on shore to the captain, who received me, very\\nstiffly, with, \"Mr Keene, you have had a narrow escape.  How did you\\nget back?\"\\n\\nI replied, that the vessel which picked me up was bound to London and\\nthat I had taken the coach down.\\n\\n\"Well, I never had an idea that we should have seen you again and I have\\nwritten to your mother, acquainting her with your loss.\"\\n\\n\"Have you, sir?\" replied I; \"it will make her very unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it will; but I shall write by this post, stating that you\\nhave been so fortunately preserved.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I; \"have you any further orders, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, Mr Keene; you may go on board and return to your duty.\"\\n\\nI made my bow, and quitted the room; went down below, and found Bob\\nCross waiting for me.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said he, as we walked away.\\n\\n\"Stiff as ever,\" replied I: \"told me to go on board and \\'tend to my\\nduty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I knew it would be so,\" replied Bob; \"it\\'s hard to say what stuff\\nthem great nobs are made of.  Never mind that; you\\'ve your own game to\\nplay, and your own secret to keep.\"\\n\\n\"His secret,\" replied I, biting my lips, \"to keep or to tell, as may\\nhappen.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let your vexation get the better of you, Master Keene; you\\'ve the\\nbest of it, if you only keep your temper; let him play his cards, and\\nyou play yours.  As you know his cards and he don\\'t know yours, you must\\nwin the game in the end--that is, if you are commonly prudent.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Cross,\" replied I; \"but you forget that I am but a boy.\"\\n\\n\"You are but a boy, Master Keene, but you\\'ve no fool\\'s head on your\\nshoulders.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" replied I; \"but here we are at the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and, as I live, here\\'s Peggy Pearson.  Well, Peggy, how did you\\nlike your cruise with Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"If I ever go on another, I hope he will be my companion.  Master Keene,\\nwill you allow me to go on board with you to see my husband?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Peggy,\" replied Cross; \"the first lieutenant would not refuse\\nyou after what has happened, nor Captain Delmar either, stiff as he is:\\nfor, although he never shows it, he don\\'t want feeling.  Jim will be\\nglad to see you, Peggy; you haven\\'t an idea how he took on, when he\\nheard of your loss.  He borrowed a pocket-handkerchief from the corporal\\nof marines.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect he\\'d rather borrow a bottle of rum from the purser,\" replied\\nPeggy.\\n\\n\"Recollect, Peggy,\" said I, holding up my finger.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I do recollect; I pledge you my word that I have not tasted\\na drop of spirits since we parted--and that with a sovereign in my\\npocket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, only keep to it--that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"I will, indeed, Mr Keene; and, what\\'s more, I shall love you as long\\nas I live.\"\\n\\nWe pulled on board in the gig, and Peggy was soon in the arms of her\\nhusband.  As Pearson embraced her at the gangway--for he could not help\\nit--the first lieutenant very kindly said, \"Pearson, I shan\\'t want you\\non deck till after dinner: you may go below with your wife.\"\\n\\n\"Now, may God bless you, for a cross-looking, kind-hearted gentleman,\"\\nsaid Peggy to the first lieutenant.\\n\\nPeggy was as good as her word to me; she gave such an account of my\\ncourage and presence of mind, of her fears and at last of her getting\\ntipsy--of my remaining at the helm and managing the boat all night by\\nmyself, that I obtained great reputation among the ship\\'s company, and\\nit was all reported to the officers, and worked its way until it came\\nfrom the first lieutenant to the captain, and from the captain to the\\nport admiral.  This is certain, that Peggy Pearson did do me a good\\nservice, for I was no longer looked upon as a mere youngster, who had\\njust come to sea, and who had not been tried.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bob Cross, a day or two afterwards, \"it seems, by\\nPeggy Pearson\\'s report, that you\\'re not frightened at a trifle.\"\\n\\n\"Peg Pearson\\'s report won\\'t do me much good.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know better, Master Keene, than to say that; a mouse may\\nhelp a lion, as the fable says.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you learn all your fables, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you; there\\'s a nice little girl that used to sit on my knee\\nand read her fables to me, and I listened to her because I loved her.\"\\n\\n\"And does she do so now?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; she\\'s too big for that--she\\'d blush up to the temples; but\\nnever mind the girl or the fables.  I told you that Peggy had reported\\nyour conduct, as we say in the service.  Now do you know, that this very\\nday I heard the first lieutenant speaking of it to the captain, and\\nyou\\'ve no idea how proud the captain looked, although he pretended to\\ncare nothing about it; I watched him, and he looked as much as to say,\\n`that\\'s my boy.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, if that pleases him, I\\'ll make him prouder yet of me, if I have\\nthe opportunity,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That you will, Master Keene, if I\\'m any judge of fizonomy; and that\\'s\\nthe way to go to a parent\\'s heart: make him feel proud of you.\"\\n\\nI did not forget this, as the reader will eventually discover.\\n\\nI had written to my mother, giving her a long account of my adventures,\\nbut not saying a word of my having been at Chatham.  I made her suppose,\\nas I did the captain, that I had been carried up to London.  My letter\\nreached her the day after the one announcing my safety, written to her\\nby Captain Delmar.\\n\\nShe answered me by return of post, thanking Heaven for my preservation,\\nand stating how great had been her anguish and misery at my supposed\\nloss.  In the latter part of the letter was this paragraph:--\\n\\n  \"Strange to say, on the night of the 16th, when I was on my bed in\\n  tears, having but just received the news of your loss, your\\n  grandmother went downstairs, and declares that she saw you or your\\n  ghost in the little back parlour.  At all events, I found her\\n  insensible on the floor, so that she must have seen something.  She\\n  might have been frightened at nothing; and yet I know not what to\\n  think, for there are circumstances which almost make _me_ believe that\\n  somebody was in the house.  I presume you can prove an _alibi_.\"\\n\\nThat my mother had been suspicious, perhaps more than suspicious, from\\nthe disappearance of the letter, I was convinced.  When I replied to\\nher, I said:--\\n\\n  \"My _alibi_ is easily proved by applying to the master and seamen of\\n  the vessel on board of which I was.  Old granny must have been\\n  frightened at her own shadow: the idea of my coming to your house, and\\n  having left it without seeing you is rather too absurd; granny must\\n  have invented the story, because she hates me, and thought to make you\\n  do the same.\"\\n\\nWhatever my mother may have thought, she did not again mention the\\nsubject.  I had, however, a few days afterwards, a letter from my aunt\\nMilly, in which she laughingly told the same story of granny swearing\\nthat she had seen me or my ghost.  \"At first we thought it was your\\nghost, but since a letter from Captain Delmar to your mother has been\\nmissing, it is now imagined that you have been here, and have taken\\npossession of it.  You will tell me, my dearest Percival, I\\'m sure, if\\nyou did play this trick to granny, or not; you know you may trust me\\nwith any of your tricks.\"\\n\\nBut I was not in this instance to be wheedled by my aunt.  I wrote in\\nreturn, saying how much I was amazed at my grandmother telling such\\nfibs, and proved to her most satisfactorily that I was in London at the\\ntime they supposed I might have been at Chatham.\\n\\nThat my aunt had been requested by my mother to try to find out the\\ntruth, I was well convinced: but I felt my secret of too much importance\\nto trust either of them and from that time the subject was never\\nmentioned; and I believe it was at last surmised that the letter might\\nhave been destroyed accidentally or purposely by the maid-servant, and\\nthat my grandmother had been frightened at nothing at all--an opinion\\nmore supported, as the maid, who had taken advantage of my mother\\'s\\nretiring to her room, and had been out gossiping, declared that she had\\nnot left the premises three minutes, and not a soul could have come in.\\nMoreover, it was so unlikely that I could have been in Chatham without\\nbeing recognised by somebody.\\n\\nMy grandmother shook her head, and said nothing during all this\\ncanvassing of the question; but my aunt Milly declared that I never\\nwould have been at Chatham without coming to see her.  And it was her\\nopinion that the servant girl had read the letter when left on the\\ntable, and had taken it out to show to her associates; and somebody who\\nwished to have a hold upon my mother by the possession of the letter had\\nretained it.\\n\\nI think my mother came to that opinion at last, and it was the source of\\nmuch uneasiness to her.  She dared not say a word to Captain Delmar, and\\nevery day expected to have an offer made of returning the letter, upon a\\ncertain sum being paid down.  But the offer was never made, as the\\nletter had been sewed up by Bob Cross in the piece of seal-skin, and was\\nworn round my neck with a ribbon, with as much care as if it had been a\\nsupposed bit of the wood of the true cross, possessed by some old female\\nCatholic devotee.\\n\\nBut long before all these discussions were over, H.M. ship Calliope had\\nbeen ordered to sail, and was steering down the Channel before a smart\\nbreeze.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough I have so much to say as to oblige me to pass over without\\nnotice the majority of my companions, I think I ought to dedicate one\\nchapter to a more particular description of those with whom I was now\\nprincipally in contact on board of the Calliope.\\n\\nI have already spoken much of the Honourable Captain Delmar, but I must\\ndescribe him more particularly.  When young, he must have been a very\\nhandsome man; even now, although nearly fifty years of age, and his hair\\nand whiskers a little mixed with grey, he was a fine-looking personage,\\nof florid complexion, large blue eyes, nose and mouth very perfect: in\\nheight he was full six feet; and he walked so erect that he looked even\\ntaller.\\n\\nThere was precision, I may say dignity, in all his motions.  If he\\nturned to you, it was slowly and deliberately; there was nothing like\\nrapidity in his movement.  On the most trifling occasions, he wrapped\\nhimself up in etiquette with all the consequence of a Spanish Hidalgo;\\nand showed in almost every action and every word that he never forgot\\nhis superiority of birth.\\n\\nNo one, except myself, perhaps, would ever have thought of taking a\\nliberty with him; for although there was a pomposity about him, at the\\nsame time it was the pomposity of a high-bred gentleman, who respected\\nhimself, and expected every one to do the same.\\n\\nThat sometimes a little mirth was occasioned by his extreme precision is\\ntrue; but it was whispered, not boldly indulged in.  As to his qualities\\nas an officer and seaman, I shall only say, that they were considered\\nmore than respectable.  Long habit of command had given him a fair\\nknowledge of the duties in the first instance, and he never condescended\\n(indeed, it would have been contrary to his character) to let the\\nofficers or seamen know whether he did or did not know anything about\\nthe second.\\n\\nAs to his moral character, I can only say, that it was very difficult to\\nascertain it.  That he would never do that which was in the slightest\\ndegree derogatory to the character of a gentleman was most certain: but\\nhe was so wrapped up in exclusiveness, that it was almost impossible to\\nestimate his feelings.  Occasionally, I may say very rarely, he might\\nexpress them; but if he did, it was but for a moment, and he was again\\nreserved as before.\\n\\nThat he was selfish is true; but who is not? and those in high rank are\\nstill more so than others, not so much by nature, but because their self\\nis encouraged by those around them.  You could easily offend his pride\\nbut he was above being flattered in a gross way.  I really believe that\\nthe person in the ship for whom he had the least respect was the\\nobsequious Mr Culpepper.  Such was the Honourable Captain Delmar.\\n\\nMr Hippesley, the first lieutenant, was a broad-shouldered,\\nungainly-looking personage.  He had more the appearance of a master in\\nthe service than a first lieutenant.  He was a thorough seaman; and\\nreally, for a first lieutenant, a very good-natured man.  All that was\\nrequisite, was to allow his momentary anger to have free escape by the\\nsafety-valve of his mouth: if you did not, an explosion was sure to be\\nthe result.\\n\\nHe was, as we use the term at sea, a regular ship husband--that is to\\nsay, he seldom put his foot on shore; and if he did, he always appeared\\nanxious to get on board again.  He was on good terms, but not familiar,\\nwith his messmates, and very respectful to the captain.  There was no\\nother officer in the service who would have suited Captain Delmar so\\nwell as Mr Hippesley, who, although he might occasionally grumble at\\nnot being promoted, appeared on the whole to be very indifferent about\\nthe matter.\\n\\nThe men were partial to him, as they always are to one who, whatever may\\nbe his peculiarities, is consistent.  Nothing is more unpleasant to men\\nthan to sail under a person whom, to use their own expression, \"they\\nnever knew where to find.\"\\n\\nThe second and third lieutenants, Mr Percival and Mr Weymss, were\\nyoung men of good family, and were admitted to a very slight degree of\\nfamiliarity with Captain Delmar: they were of gentlemanly manners, both\\ngood seamen, and kind to their inferiors.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, the purser, was my abomination--a nasty, earwigging,\\nflattering, bowing old rogue.  The master, Mr Smith, was a very quiet\\nman, plain and unoffending, but perfectly master of, and always\\nattentive to, his duty.\\n\\nThe marine officer, Mr Tusk, was a nonentity put into a red jacket.\\nThe surgeon was a tall, and very finicking sort of gentleman as to\\ndress; but well informed, friendly in disposition, and perfectly\\nacquainted with his profession.\\n\\nMy messmates were most of them young men of good birth, with the\\nexception of Tommy Dott, who was the son of a warrant officer, and Mr\\nGreen, whose father was a boot-maker in London.  I shall not, however,\\nwaste my reader\\'s time upon them; they will appear when required.  I\\nshall, therefore, now proceed with my narrative.\\n\\nIt is usually the custom for the midshipmen to take up provisions and\\nspirits beyond their allowance, and pay the purser an extra sum for the\\nsame; but this Mr Culpepper would not permit--indeed, he was the most\\nstingy and disagreeable old fellow that I ever met with in the service.\\nWe never had dinner or grog enough, or even lights sufficient for our\\nwants.\\n\\nWe complained to the first lieutenant, but he was not inclined to assist\\nus: he said we had our allowance, and it was all we could demand; that\\ntoo much grog was bad for us, and as for candles, they only made us sit\\nup late when we ought to be in bed: he was, moreover, very strict about\\nthe lights being put out.  This, however, was the occasion of war to the\\nknife between the midshipmen and Mr Culpepper.\\n\\nBut it was of no avail; he would seldom trust his own steward or the\\nmate of the main deck; whenever he could, he superintended the serving\\nout of all provisions and mixing of the grog: no wonder that he was said\\nto be a rich man.  The only party to whom he was civil was Mr\\nHippesley, the first lieutenant, and the captain; both of whom had the\\npower of annoying him, and reducing his profits.\\n\\nTo the captain he was all humility; every expense that he required was,\\nwith his proffered bow, cheerfully submitted to; but he gained on the\\nwhole by this apparent liberality, as the captain was rather inclined to\\nprotect him in all other points of service, except those connected with\\nhis own comforts and luxuries; and many a good job did Mr Culpepper get\\ndone for him, by humbly requesting and obsequiously bowing.\\n\\nWe had been at sea for about a week, and were running down towards the\\nisland of Madeira, which we expected to reach the next morning.  Our\\ndestination was a secret, as our captain sailed with sealed orders, to\\nbe opened when off that island.\\n\\nThe weather was very fine and warm, and the wind had fallen, when at\\nsundown high land was reported from the mast-head, at about forty miles\\ndistant.  I was, as on the former cruise, signal midshipman, and did day\\nduty--that is, I went down with the sun, and kept no night watch.\\n\\nI had been cogitating how I could play some trick to Mr Culpepper: the\\nmidshipmen had often proposed that we should do so, but I had made up my\\nmind that, whenever I did, I would make no confidant.  Tommy Dott often\\nsuggested an idea, but I invariably refused, as a secret is only a\\nsecret when it is known to one person: for that reason I never consulted\\nBob Cross, because I knew that he would have persuaded me not to do so;\\nbut after anything was happily executed, I then used to confide in him.\\n\\nI observed before that Mr Culpepper wore a flaxen wig, and I felt sure,\\nfrom his penuriousness, that he was not likely to have more than one on\\nboard.  I, therefore, fixed upon his wig as the object of my vengeance,\\nand having made up my mind on the night that we made the island of\\nMadeira, I determined to put my project in execution.\\n\\nFor convenience, the first lieutenant had a small ladder which went down\\nthrough the skylight of the gun-room so that they could descend direct,\\ninstead of going round by the after-hatchway, and entering by the\\ngun-room doors, where the sentry was placed.\\n\\nI went to my hammock and slept till the middle watch was called; I then\\ngot up and dressed myself without being perceived.\\n\\nAs soon as the lieutenant of the middle watch had been called by the\\nmate, who lighted his candle and left him to dress himself, I came up by\\nthe after-ladder, and, watching an opportunity when the sentry at the\\ncaptain\\'s cabin door had walked forward, I softly descended by the\\nskylight ladder into the gun-room.\\n\\nThe light in the cabin of the lieutenant, who was dressing, was quite\\nsufficient, and the heat of the weather was so great, that all the\\nofficers slept with their cabin doors fastened back, for ventilation; I\\nhad, therefore, no difficulty in putting my hand on the purser\\'s wig,\\nwith which I escaped unperceived, and immediately turned in again to my\\nhammock, to consider what I should do with my prize.\\n\\nShould I throw it overboard; should I stuff it down the pump-well, or\\nslip it into the ship\\'s coppers, that it might re-appear when the\\npea-soup was baled out or dinner; or should I put it into the manger\\nforward, where the pigs were?\\n\\nIn the meantime, while I was considering the matter, the midshipman of\\nthe first watch came down and turned in, and all was again quiet, except\\nan occasional nasal melody from some heavy sleeper.\\n\\nAt last, quite undecided, I peeped through the clews of my hammock to\\nsee what the sentry at the gun-room door was about, and found that he\\nhad sat down on a chest, and was fast asleep.  I knew immediately that\\nthe man was in my power, and I did not fear him; and then it was that\\nthe idea came into my head, that I would singe the purser\\'s wig.  I went\\nsoftly to the sentry\\'s light, took it from the hook, and went down with\\nit into the cockpit, as being the best place for carrying on my\\noperations.  The wig was very greasy, and every curl, as I held it in\\nthe candle, flared up, and burned beautifully to within a quarter of an\\ninch of the caul.\\n\\nIt was soon done, and I replaced the sentry\\'s light; and finding that\\nthe gun-room door was a-jar, I went in softly, and replaced the wig\\nwhere I had taken it from, repassed the sentry, who was still fast\\nasleep, and regained my hammock, intending to undress myself in it; but\\nI had quite forgotten one thing (I was soon reminded of it)--I heard the\\nvoice of the officer of the watch I calling out to the sentry at the\\ncabin door--\\n\\n\"Sentry, what\\'s that smell of burning?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, sir,\" replied the sentry; \"I was just thinking of going\\nforward for the ship\\'s corporal.\"\\n\\nThe smell, which had gradually ascended from the cockpit, now spread\\nfrom deck to deck, and became stronger and stronger.  The gun-room-door\\nsentry jumped up at the voice of the lieutenant, and called out that\\nthere was a very strong smell in the cockpit.  The lieutenant and mate\\nof the watch came down, and it was immediately supposed that the\\nspirit-room had caught fire, for the smell was really very powerful.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant, who had wakened up at the voices, was out in a\\nminute; he put his head over the cockpit, and ordering the officer of\\nthe watch to call the drummer, and beat to quarters, ran up to inform\\nthe captain.\\n\\nThe drummer was out in a moment, and, seizing his drum, which hung up by\\nthe mainmast, ran up in his shirt and beat the tattoo.\\n\\nThe whole ship\\'s company rose up at the sound, which they knew was the\\nsignal for something important; and the beat of the drum was followed up\\nby the shrill piping of the boatswain\\'s mates at each hatchway.\\n\\nAt that moment, some frightened man belonging to the watch cried out\\nthat the ship was on fire, and the lower decks were immediately a scene\\nof bustle and confusion.\\n\\nPerhaps there is nothing more awful than the alarm of fire at sea; the\\nfeeling that there is no escape--the only choice being by which element,\\nfire or water, you choose to perish.  But if it is awful in daylight,\\nhow much more so is it to be summoned up to await such peril when you\\nhave been sleeping in fancied bounty.\\n\\nThe captain had hurried on his clothes, and stood on the quarter-deck.\\nHe was apparently calm and collected; but, as usual, the first\\nlieutenant carried on the duty, and well he did it.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the gunner?  Mr Hutt, bring up the keys from my cabin, and\\nhave all ready for clearing the magazines if required.  Firemen, get\\nyour buckets to bear; carpenters, rig the pumps.  Silence there, fore\\nand aft.\"\\n\\nBut the confusion became very great, and there evidently was a panic.\\nThe captain then interposed, calling out to the boatswain and his mates\\nto send every man aft on the quarter-deck.\\n\\nThis order was obeyed; the men came thronging like a flock of sheep,\\nhuddling together and breathless.\\n\\n\"Silence there, my men,\" cried Captain Delmar--\"silence.  I say; is this\\nthe conduct of men-of-war\\'s-men?  Every man of you sit down on deck--\\npass the word there for every man to sit down.\"\\n\\nThe order was mechanically obeyed, and as soon as the ship\\'s company\\nwere all seated, the captain said--\\n\\n\"I tell you what, my lads, I\\'m ashamed of you: the way to put out a fire\\nis to be cool and calm, obeying orders and keeping silence.  Now collect\\nyourselves, all of you, for until you are all quiet and cool, you will\\nsit where you are.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause of a few seconds--\\n\\n\"Now, my men, are you more steady?  Recollect, be cool, and keep\\nsilence.  Carpenter, are the pumps rigged?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the carpenter.\\n\\n\"Now, firemen, go for your buckets; let nobody else move.  Silence--not\\na word: three foremast guns main-deck, to your quarters.  Silence and\\nquiet, if you please.  Now, are you all steady?--then, to your quarters,\\nmy men, and wait for orders.\"\\n\\nIt was astonishing how collected the ship\\'s company became by the\\njudicious conduct of the captain, who now continued to command.  When\\nthe men had gone down to their stations, he directed the two junior\\nlieutenants to go and examine where the fire was, and to be careful not\\nto lift the hatches if they discovered that it was in the spirit-room.\\n\\nI had been on the quarter-deck some time, and, being aware of the cause,\\nof course was not at all alarmed: and I had exerted myself very\\nassiduously in keeping the men cool and quiet, shoving the men down who\\nwere unwilling to sit down on the deck, and even using them very\\nroughly; showing a great deal more _sang froid_ than any other of the\\nofficers, which of course was not to be wondered at.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who was most terribly alarmed, had come up on deck, and\\nstood trembling close to the side of the captain and first lieutenant;\\nhe had pulled on his wig without discovering that it had been burnt, and\\nas I passed him, the burnt smell was very strong indeed; so thought the\\ncaptain and the first lieutenant, who were waiting the return of the\\nofficers.\\n\\n\"I smell the fire very strong just now,\" said the captain to the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, every now and then it is very strong,\" replied the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\nThe purser\\'s wig was just between them,--no wonder that they smelt it.\\nAfter two or three minutes the officers came up, and reported that they\\ncould discover no fire, and that there was very little smell of fire\\ndown below.\\n\\n\"And yet I smell it now,\" said Captain Delmar.\\n\\n\"So do I, sir,\" said the second lieutenant; \"and it really smells\\nstronger on deck than it does down below.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very odd; let them continue the search.\"\\n\\nThe search was continued; the first lieutenant now going down, and after\\na time they said that the strongest smell was from the purser\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\"Mr Culpepper, they say the smell is in your cabin,\" said Captain\\nDelmar; \"go down, if you please; they may want to open your lockers.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who still trembled like an aspen, went down the ladder,\\nand I followed him; but in descending the second ladder his foot\\nslipped, and he fell down the hatchway to the lower deck.\\n\\nI hastened down after him; he was stunned, and I thought this a good\\nopportunity to pull off his wig, which I did very dexterously, and\\nconcealed it.  He was taken into the gun-room, and the surgeon called,\\nwhile I walked up on deck, and quietly dropped the wig overboard at the\\ngangway.\\n\\nMy reason for doing this was, that having no idea that my trick would\\nhave created so much confusion, and have turned up the officers and men\\nas it did, I thought that the purser\\'s wig would, the next morning,\\naccount for the smell of fire, and an investigation take place, which,\\nalthough it might not lead to discovery, would certainly lead to\\nsuspicion; so the wig was now floating away, and with the wig went away\\nall evidence.\\n\\nAfter a search of nearly half an hour, nothing was discovered; the\\ndrummer was ordered to beat the retreat, and all was quiet again.\\n\\nI went to bed quite satisfied with the events of the night, and slept\\nthe sleep of innocence--at least I slept just as soundly.\\n\\nThis mysterious affair ever remained a mystery: the only loss was the\\npurser\\'s wig, but that was nothing, as Mr Culpepper acknowledged that\\nhe did not know himself what he was about, and, for all he knew to the\\ncontrary, he might have thrown it overboard.\\n\\nMy conduct on this occasion again gained me great credit.  It had been\\nremarked by the captain and officers, and I rose in estimation.  How I\\nmight have behaved had I really supposed that the ship was on fire, is\\nquite another affair--I presume not quite so fearlessly.  As it was, I\\nwas resolved to take all the credit given to me and for that reason it\\nwas not till a long while afterwards, that I hinted the secret even to\\nBob Cross.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, when we arrived at Funchal, we found that our orders\\nwere for the West Indies: we stayed one day to take in wine and then\\nhove up the anchor, and went on to our destination.  We soon got into\\nthe trades, and run them fast down till we arrived at Carlisle Bay,\\nBarbadoes, where we found the admiral and delivered our despatches.  We\\nwere ordered to water and complete as soon as possible, as we were to be\\nsent on a cruise.\\n\\nTommy Dott, my quondam ally, was in disgrace.  He had several times\\nduring the cruise proposed that I should join him in several plots of\\nmischief, but I refused, as I did not consider them quite safe.\\n\\n\"You are not the keen fellow I thought you were,\" said he; \"you are up\\nto nothing now; there\\'s no fun in you, as there used to be.\"\\n\\nHe was mistaken; there was fun in me, but there was also prudence, and\\nfrom what I had latterly seen of Tommy Dott, I did not think he was to\\nbe trusted.\\n\\nThe day after we anchored at Carlisle Bay, Tommy came to me and said,\\n\"Old Culpepper serves out plums and suet this afternoon; I heard him\\ntell steward.  Now, I think we may manage to get some--I never saw\\nbetter plums on board of a ship.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I like raisins as well as you do, Tommy--but what is\\nyour plan?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve got my squirt: and old Culpepper never lights more than one\\nof his purser\\'s dips (small candles) in the steward\\'s room.  I\\'ll get\\ndown in the cockpit in the dark, and squirt at the candle--the water\\nwill put it out, and he\\'ll send the steward for another light, and then\\nI\\'ll try and get some.\"\\n\\nIt was not a bad plan, but still I refused to join in it, as it was only\\nthe work of one person, and not two.  I pointed that out to him and he\\nagreed with me, saying that he would do it himself.\\n\\nWhen Mr Culpepper went down into the steward\\'s room, Tommy\\nreconnoitred, and then came into the berth and filled his squirt.\\n\\nAlthough I would not join him, I thought I might as well see what was\\ngoing on and therefore descended the cockpit ladder soon after Tommy,\\nkeeping out of the way in the foremost part of the cockpit, where it was\\nquite dark.\\n\\nTommy directed his squirt very dexterously, hit the lighted wick of the\\nsolitary candle, which fizzed, sputtered, and finally gave up the ghost.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" said Mr Culpepper, \"what can that be?\"\\n\\n\"A leak from the seams above I suppose,\" said the steward:\\n\\n\"I will go to the gallery for another light.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, be quick,\" said Mr Culpepper, who remained in the steward\\'s\\nroom in the dark, until the return of the steward.\\n\\nTommy Dott then slipped in softly, and commenced filling all his pockets\\nwith the raisins; he had nearly taken in his full cargo, when, somehow\\nor another, Mr Culpepper stepped forward from where he stood, and he\\ntouched Tommy, whom he immediately seized crying out, \"Thieves!\\nthieves!--call the sentry!--sentry, come here.\"\\n\\nThe sentry of the gun-room door went down the ladder as Mr Culpepper\\ndragged out Tommy, holding him fast by both hands.\\n\\n\"Take him, sentry--take him in charge.  Call the master-at-arms--little\\nthief.  Mr Dott!  Hah--well, we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nThe consequence was, that Mr Tommy Dott was handed from the sentry to\\nthe master-at-arms, and taken up on the quarterdeck, followed by Mr\\nCulpepper and his steward.\\n\\nThere was no defence or excuse to be made: the pockets of his jacket and\\nof his trowsers were stuffed with raisins; and at the bottom of his\\npocket, when they were emptied by the master-at-arms, was found the\\nsquirt.\\n\\nAs soon as the hue and cry was over, and all the parties were on the\\nquarter-deck, as the coast was clear, I thought I might as well take\\nadvantage of it; and therefore I came out from my hiding-place, went\\ninto the steward\\'s room, filled my handkerchief with raisins, and\\nescaped to the berth unperceived; so that while Tommy Dott was\\ndisgorging on the quarter-deck, I was gorging below.\\n\\nMr Dott was reported to the captain for this heinous offence; and, in\\nconsequence, was ordered below under arrest, his place in the captain\\'s\\ngig being filled up by me; so that in every point of view Tommy\\nsuffered, and I reaped the harvest.  What pleased me most was, that,\\nbeing midshipman of the captain\\'s boat, I was of course continually in\\nthe company of the coxswain, Bob Cross.\\n\\nBut I must not delay at present, as I have to record a very serious\\nadventure which occurred, and by which I, for a long while, was\\nseparated from my companions and shipmates.\\n\\nIn ten days we sailed in search of a pirate vessel, which was reported\\nto have committed many dreadful excesses, and had become the terror of\\nthe mercantile navy.  Our orders were to proceed northward, and to\\ncruise off the Virgin Islands, near which she was said to have been last\\nseen.\\n\\nAbout three weeks after we had left Carlisle Bay, the look-out man\\nreported two strange sail from the mast-head.  I was sent up, as signal\\nmid, to examine them, and found that they were both schooners, hove to\\nclose together; one of them very rakish in their appearance.  All sail\\nin chase was made immediately, and we came up within three miles of\\nthem, when one, evidently the pirate we were in search of, made sail,\\nwhile the other remained hove to.\\n\\nAs we passed the vessel hove to, which we took it for granted was a\\nmerchantman, which the pirate had been plundering, the captain ordered\\none of the cutters to be lowered down with a midshipman and boat\\'s crew\\nto take possession of her.  The men were all in the boat, but the\\nmidshipman had gone down for his spy-glass, or something else, and as it\\nwas merely with a view of ascertaining what the vessel was, and the\\nchief object was to overtake the pirate vessel, to prevent the delay\\nwhich was caused by the other midshipman not being ready, Mr Hippesley\\nordered me to go into the boat instead of him, and, as soon as I was on\\nboard of the schooner, to make sail and follow the frigate.\\n\\nThe captain did say, \"He is too young, Mr Hippesley; is he not?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d sooner trust him than many older, sir,\" was the reply of the first\\nlieutenant.  \"Jump in, Mr Keene.\"  I did so, with my telescope in my\\nhand.  \"Lower away, my lads--unhook, and sheer off;\" and away went the\\nfrigate in pursuit of the pirate vessel, leaving me in the boat, to go\\non board of the schooner.\\n\\nWe were soon alongside, and found that there was not a soul on board of\\nthe vessel; what had become of the crew, whether they had been murdered,\\nor not, it was impossible to say, but there were a few drops of blood on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nThe vessel was an American, bound to one of the islands, with shingle\\nand fir planks; not only was her hold full, but the fir planks were\\npiled up on each side of the deck, between the masts, to the height of\\nfive or six feet.  The pirate had, apparently, been taking some of the\\nplanks on board for her own use.\\n\\nWe dropped the boat astern, let draw the foresheet, and made sail after\\nthe frigate, which was now more than a mile from us, and leaving us very\\nfast.\\n\\nThe schooner was so over-loaded that she sailed very badly, and before\\nthe evening closed in, we could just perceive the top-gallant sails of\\nthe Calliope above the horizon: but this we thought little of, as we\\nknew that as soon as she had captured the pirate she would run back\\nagain, and take us out.\\n\\nThere were some hams and other articles on board, for the pirates had\\nnot taken everything, although the lockers had been all broken open, and\\nthe articles were strewed about in every direction in the cabin and on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nJust before dark, we took the bearings of the frigate, and stood the\\nsame course as she was doing, and then we sat down to a plentiful meal\\nto which we did justice.  I then divided the boat\\'s crew into watches,\\nwent down into the cabin, and threw myself on the standing bed-place, of\\nwhich there was but one, with all my clothes on; the men who had not the\\nwatch went down, and turned in in the cuddy forward, where the seamen\\nusually sleep.\\n\\nIt was not till past midnight that I could obtain any sleep; the heat\\nwas excessive, and I was teased by the cockroaches, which appeared to\\nswarm in the cabin to an incredible degree, and were constantly running\\nover my face and body.  I little thought then why they swarmed.  I\\nrecollect that I dreamt of murder, and tossing men overboard; and then\\nof the vessel being on fire and after that, I felt very cool and\\ncomfortable, and I dreamed no more; I thought that I heard a voice\\ncalling my name: it appeared that I did hear it in my sleep, but I slept\\non.\\n\\nAt last I turned round, and felt a splashing as of water, and some water\\ncoming into my mouth: I awoke.  All was dark and quiet; I put my hand\\nout, and I put it into the water--where was I--was I overboard?  I\\njumped up in my fright; I found that was still on the standing\\nbed-place, but the water was above the mattress.\\n\\nI immediately comprehended that the vessel was sinking, and I called\\nout, but there was no reply.\\n\\nI turned out of the bed-place, and found myself up to my neck in water,\\nwith my feet on the cabin-deck.  Half swimming, and half floundering, I\\ngained the ladder, and went up the hatchway.\\n\\nIt was still quite dark, and I could not perceive nor hear anybody.  I\\ncalled out but there was no reply.  I then was certain that the men had\\nleft the vessel when they round her sinking, and had left me to sink\\nwith her.  I may as well here observe, that when the men had found the\\nwater rising upon them forward they had rushed on deck in a panic,\\ntelling the man at the wheel that the vessel was sinking, and had\\nimmediately hauled up the boat to save their lives; but they did\\nrecollect me, and the coxswain of the boat had come down in the cabin by\\nthe ladder, and called me: but the cabin was full of water, and he,\\nreceiving no answer, considered that I was drowned, and returned on\\ndeck.\\n\\nThe boat had then shoved off, and I was left to my fate; still I hoped\\nthat such was not the case, and I hallooed again and again, but in vain,\\nand I thought it was all over with me.  It was a dreadful position to be\\nin.  I said my prayers and prepared to die, and yet I thought it was\\nhard to die at fifteen years old.\\n\\nAlthough I do not consider that my prayers were of much efficacy, for\\nthere was but little resignation in them, praying had one good effect--\\nit composed me, and I began to think whether there was any chance of\\nbeing saved.\\n\\nYes, there were plenty of planks on the deck, and if it were daylight I\\ncould tie them together and make a raft, which would bear me up.  How I\\nlonged for daylight, for I was afraid that the vessel would sink before\\nI could see to do what was requisite.  The wind had become much fresher\\nduring the night, and the waves now dashed against the sides of the\\nwater-logged vessel.\\n\\nAs I watched for daylight, I began to reflect how this could have\\nhappened; and it occurred to me that the pirates had scuttled the bottom\\nof the vessel to sink her; and in this conjecture I was right.\\n\\nAt last a faint light appeared in the east, which soon broke into broad\\nday, and I lost no time in setting about my work.\\n\\nBefore I began, however, I thought it advisable to ascertain how much\\nmore water there was in the vessel since I had quitted the cabin which\\nit appeared to me must have been about two hours.  I therefore went down\\nin the cabin to measure it.  I know how high it was when I waded through\\nit.  I found, to my surprise, and, I may say, to my joy, that it was not\\nhigher than it was before.\\n\\nI thought that perhaps I might be mistaken, so I marked the height of\\nthe water at the cabin ladder, and I sat down on deck to watch it; it\\nappeared to me not to rise any higher.\\n\\nThis made me reflect, and it then struck me that, as the vessel was\\nladen with timber, she would not probably sink any lower, so I deferred\\nmy work till I had ascertained the fact.\\n\\nThree hours did I watch, and found that the water did not rise higher,\\nand I was satisfied; but the wind increased, and the vessel\\'s sails,\\ninstead of flapping to the wind as she drove without any one at the\\nhelm, were now bellied out, and the vessel careened to leeward.\\n\\nI was afraid that she would turn over; and finding an axe on the deck, I\\nmounted the rigging with it, and commenced cutting away the lacing of\\nthe sails from the mast.  I then lowered the gaffs, and cleared away the\\ncanvass in the same way, so that the sails fell on the deck.  This was a\\nwork of at least one hour; but when the canvass was off, the vessel was\\nsteady.\\n\\nIt was well that I had taken this precaution; for very soon afterwards\\nthe wind was much fresher, and the weather appeared very threatening;\\nthe sea also rose considerably.  I was very tired, and sat down for some\\ntime on the deck abaft.\\n\\nIt then occurred to me that the weight of the planks upon the deck must\\nnot only keep the vessel deeper in the water, but make her more\\ntop-heavy, and I determined to throw them overboard; but first I looked\\nfor something to eat, and found plenty of victuals in the iron pot in\\nwhich the men had cooked their supper the night before.\\n\\nAs soon as I had obtained from the cask lashed on the deck a drink of\\nwater, to wash down the cold fried ham which I had eaten, I set work to\\nthrow overboard the planks on deck.\\n\\nWhen I had thrown over a portion from one side I went to the other, and\\nthrew over as many more, that I might, as much as possible, keep the\\nvessel on an even keel.\\n\\nThis job occupied me the whole of the day; and when I had completed my\\ntask I examined the height of the water at the cabin ladder, and found\\nthat the vessel had risen more than six inches.  This was a source of\\ngreat comfort to me, and what pleased me more was, that the wind had\\ngone down again, and the water was much smoother.\\n\\nI made a supper off some raw ham, for the fire had been extinguished,\\nand committing myself to the protection of Heaven, lay down as the sun\\nset, and from the fatigue of the day was soon in a sound sleep.\\n\\nI awoke about the middle of the night.  The stars shone brightly, and\\nthere was but a slight ripple on the water.\\n\\nI thought of my mother, of my aunt Milly, of Captain Delmar, and I felt\\nfor the seal-skin pouch which was fastened round my neck.  It was all\\nsafe.\\n\\nI calculated chances, and I made up my mind that I should be picked up\\nby some vessel or another before long.\\n\\nI said to myself--\"Why, I am better off now than I was when in the\\nwherry, with Peggy Pearson; I was saved then, why should I not be now?\"\\n\\nI felt no desponding, and lay down, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nIt was broad daylight when I awoke; I took my spy-glass, and looking\\nround the horizon, discovered a vessel several miles off, standing\\ntowards me.  This gave me fresh spirits.\\n\\nI made a raw breakfast, and drank plenty of water as before.  The wind,\\nwhich was very light, increased a little.  The vessel came nearer, and I\\nmade her out to be a schooner.  In two hours she was close to me, and I\\nwaved my hat, and hallooed as loud as I could.\\n\\nThe schooner was full of men, and steered close to me--she was a\\nbeautiful craft, and, although the wind was so light, glided very fast\\nthrough the water, and I could not help thinking that she was the pirate\\nvessel which the frigate had been in chase of.\\n\\nIt appeared as if they intended to pass me, and I hallooed, \"Schooner,\\nahoy!  Why don\\'t you send a boat on board?\"\\n\\nI must say, that when the idea struck me that she was a pirate vessel,\\nmy heart almost failed me.\\n\\nShortly afterwards the schooner rounded to and lowered a boat, which\\npulled to the vessel.  The boat\\'s crew were all negroes.\\n\\nOne of them said, \"Jump in, you white boy; next jump he take be into the\\nshark\\'s mouth,\" continued the man, grinning, as he addressed himself to\\nthe others in the boat.\\n\\nI got into the boat, and they rowed on board the schooner.  I did then\\nthink that I was done for; for what mercy could I expect, being a king\\'s\\nofficer, from pirates, which the words of the negro convinced me they\\nwere?\\n\\nAs soon as I was alongside of the schooner, they ordered me to go up the\\nside, which I did, with my spy-glass in my hand.  I leaped from the\\ngunwale down on the deck, and found myself on board of an armed vessel,\\nwith a crew wholly composed of blacks.\\n\\nI was rudely seized by two of them, who led me aft to where a negro\\nstood apart from the rest.  A more fierce, severe, determined-looking\\ncountenance, I never beheld.  He was gigantic in stature and limbed like\\nthe Farnesian Hercules.\\n\\n\"Well, boy, who are you?\" said he, \"and how came you on board of that\\nvessel?\"\\n\\nI told him in very few words.\\n\\n\"Then you belong to that frigate that chased us the day before\\nyesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"What is her name?\"\\n\\n\"The Calliope.\"\\n\\n\"She sails well,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"she is the fastest sailer on this station.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all the information I want of you, boy: now you may go.\"\\n\\n\"Go where?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Go where?--go overboard, to be sure,\" replied he, with a grin.\\n\\nMy heart died within me; but I mustered courage enough to say, \"Much\\nobliged to you, sir; but I\\'d rather stay where I am, if it\\'s all the\\nsame to you.\"\\n\\nThe other negroes laughed at this reply, and I felt a little confidence;\\nat all events, their good-humour gave me courage, and I felt that being\\nbold was my only chance.\\n\\nThe negro captain looked at me for a time, as if considering, and at\\nlast said to the men, \"Overboard with him.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir, you\\'re very kind,\" said I; \"but this is a capital\\nspy-glass, and I leave it to you as a legacy.\"  And I went up to him and\\noffered him my spy-glass.  Merciful Heaven! bow my heart beat against my\\nribs when I did this!\\n\\nThe negro captain took the glass, and looked through it.\\n\\n\"It is a good glass,\" said he, as he removed it from his eyes.  It was\\npoor Green\\'s spy-glass, which he had given me for showing him the\\nmason\\'s signs.\\n\\n\"Well, white boy, I accept your present; and now, good bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir.  Do me one kindness in return,\" said I, very gravely,\\nfor I felt my hour was come.\\n\\n\"And what is that?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"Tie a shot to my heels, that I may sink quickly; it won\\'t take them\\nlong.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t ask me to spare your life, then?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"He de very first white dat not ask it,\" said one of the negroes.\\n\\n\"Dat really for true,\" said another.\\n\\n\"Yes, by gum,\" replied a third.\\n\\nOh, how I wished to know what to say at that moment!  The observations\\nof the negroes made me imagine that I had better not _ask_ for it and\\nyet how I clung to life!  It was an awful moment--I felt as if I had\\nlived a year in a few minutes.  For a second or two I felt faint and\\ngiddy--I drew a long breath and revived.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t answer me, boy,\" said the negro captain.\\n\\n\"Why should I ask when I feel certain to be refused?  If you will give\\nme my life, I will thank you: I don\\'t particularly wish to die, I can\\nassure you.\"\\n\\n\"I have taken an oath never to spare a white man.  For once I am sorry\\nthat I cannot break my oath.\"\\n\\n\"If that is all, I am a boy, and not a man,\" replied I.  \"Keep me till I\\ngrow bigger.\"\\n\\n\"By golly, captain, that very well said.  Keep him, captain,\" said one\\nof the negroes.\\n\\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied another; \"keep him to tend your cabin.  Proper\\nyou have white slave boy.\"\\n\\nThe negro captain for some time made no reply; he appeared to be in deep\\nthought.  At last he said--\\n\\n\"Boy, you have saved your life: you may thank yourself and not me.\\nProssa, let him be taken below; give him a frock and trousers and throw\\nthat infernal dress overboard, or I may change my resolution.\"\\n\\nThe negro who was addressed, and who wore a sort of uniform as an\\nofficer--which he was, being second mate--led me below,--nothing loth, I\\ncan assure my readers.\\n\\nWhen I was between decks.  I sat down upon a chest, my head swam, and I\\nfainted.  The shock had been too powerful for a lad of my age.  They\\nbrought water, and recovered me.  When I revived, I felt that I might\\nhave lost in their good opinion by thus knowing my weakness; and I had\\nsufficient presence of mind to ask for something to eat.  This deceived\\nthem; they said to one another that I must have been on board that\\nvessel for two days without food, and of course I did not deny it.\\n\\nThey brought me some meat and some grog.  I ate and drank a little.\\nThey then took off my uniform, and put on me a check frock and white\\ntrousers; after which, I said I wished to lie down a little, and they\\nleft me to sleep on the chest where I had been seated.\\n\\nI pretended to sleep, although I could not; and I found out by their\\nconversation that I gained the goodwill not only of the crew, but of the\\ncaptain, by my behaviour.\\n\\nI considered that I had gained my life, at least for the present; but\\nwhat security could I have in such company?\\n\\nAfter an hour or two I felt quite recovered, and I thought it advisable\\nto go on deck.  I did so, and went right aft to the negro captain, and\\nstood before him.\\n\\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, \"why do you come to me?\"\\n\\n\"You gave me my life; you\\'re the greatest friend I have here, so I come\\nto you.  Can I do anything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you may assist in the cabin, if your white blood does not curdle\\nat the idea of attending on a black man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I will do anything for them who are kind to me, as you\\nhave been.\"\\n\\n\"And think it no disgrace?\"\\n\\n\"Not the least.  Is it a disgrace to be grateful?\"\\n\\nThe reader will observe how particularly judicious my replies were,\\nalthough but fifteen years old.  My dangerous position had called forth\\nthe reflection and caution of manhood.\\n\\n\"Go down into the cabin; you may amuse yourself till I come.\"\\n\\nI obeyed this order.  The cabin was fitted up equal to most yachts, with\\nSpanish mahogany and gold mouldings; a beaufet full of silver (there was\\nno glass) occupied nearly one-half of it; even the plates and dishes\\nwere of the same material.  Silver candelabras hung down from the middle\\nof the beams; a variety of swords, pistols, and other weapons were fixed\\nup against the bulkhead; a small bookcase, chiefly of Spanish books,\\noccupied the after-bulkhead, and the portraits of several white females\\nfilled up the intervals; a large table in the centre, a stand full of\\ncharts, half a dozen boxes of cigars, and two most luxurious sofas,\\ncompleted the furniture.\\n\\nA door from the starboard side led, I presumed, to the stateroom, where\\nthe captain slept; but I did not venture to open it.\\n\\nI surveyed all this magnificence, wondering who this personage could be;\\nand more still, how it was that the whole of the crew were, as well as\\nthe captain, of the negro race.\\n\\nWe had heard that the pirate we were in search of was a well-known\\ncharacter--a Spaniard--who went by the name of Chico, and that his crew\\nconsisted of Americans, English, and Spaniards.  That this was the\\nvessel, I knew, from the conversation of the men when I was below for\\nthey called her the Stella.\\n\\nNow, it appeared that the vessel had changed masters; the crew were\\nchiefly Spanish negroes, or other negroes who spoke Spanish, but some of\\nthem spoke English, and a few words of Spanish; these, I presumed, were\\nAmerican or English runaways.  But the captain--his language was as\\ncorrect as my own; Spanish he spoke fluently, for I heard him giving\\norders in that language while I was in the cabin; neither was he\\nflat-nosed, like the majority.  Had he been white, his features would\\nhave been considered regular, although there was a fierceness about them\\nat times which was terrible to look at.\\n\\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"if I live and do well, I shall know more about it;\\nyes, if I live, I wish I was on the quarterdeck of the Calliope, even as\\nTommy was with his pockets stuffed full of the purser\\'s raisins, and\\nlooking like a fool and a rogue at the same time.\"\\n\\nI had been down in the cabin about half an hour, when the negro captain\\nmade his appearance.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose you would as soon see the devil as me--eh,\\nboy?\"\\n\\n\"No: indeed,\" replied I, laughing--for I had quite recovered my\\nconfidence--\"for you were about to send me to the devil, and I feel most\\nhappy that I still remain with you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re exactly the cut of boy I like,\" replied he, smiling.  \"How I\\nwish that you were black!--I detest your colour.\"\\n\\n\"I have no objection to black my face, if you wish it,\" replied I: \"it\\'s\\nall the same to me what colour I am.\"\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"I was fifteen a few months back.\"\\n\\n\"How long have you been to sea?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen months.\"\\n\\nHe then asked me a great many more questions, about the captain, the\\nofficers, the ship, and myself; to all of which I answered in a guarded\\nway.\\n\\nA negro brought down his supper; it was hot, and very savoury; without\\nany order on his part, I immediately attended upon him during his meal.\\nHe told the negro not to wait and conversed with me during the time that\\nhe was eating: at last, he told me how he had doubled the frigate during\\nthe night.  I then remarked that we had been informed that the vessel\\nwas called the Stella, that the captain\\'s name was Chico, and the crew\\nwere composed of white men of different nations.\\n\\n\"A month or two ago, it was the case,\" replied the captain.  \"Now I have\\ndone, and you may clear away,\" continued he, rising from his chair and\\nthrowing himself down on one of the sofas.  \"Stop; you are hungry, I\\ndon\\'t doubt; you can sit down and eat your supper, and remove the things\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\nI did as he told me: it was the first time in my life I had supped off\\nmassive plate--but I was in strange company; however, it did not spoil\\nmy appetite, and I did not forget to drink a goblet of wine by way of\\nwashing down my repast.\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said I, rising, and then performing my office of\\nattendant.\\n\\nAt his order, I rang the bell for the negro, who assisted me in clearing\\naway, and then went out with the remains of the supper.\\n\\n\"Am I to stay or go?\" said I, respectfully.\\n\\n\"You may go now.  Find the man who came in just now--Jose he is called;\\ntell him to give you something to sleep upon.\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Good-night, boy.\"\\n\\nAs I went forward looking for the negro servant, I was accosted more\\nthan once very kindly by the negro seamen.  At last I went up on the\\nforecastle, and they asked me to tell them how I was left on board the\\nschooner.  I did so to those who spoke English, and one of them, who\\ncould speak both languages, translated into Spanish for the benefit of\\nthe others.\\n\\n\"You be first white he hab spared, I tell you,\" said the American negro,\\nwho had translated into Spanish what I had told them, after the other\\nhad left me with him.\\n\\n\"The captain says he wishes I were black,\" said I to the negro; \"I wish\\nI was, too, while I am on board of this vessel--my colour makes him\\nangry, I see that.  Could not I be stained black?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do think it will be a very safe thing for you, if it could be;\\nfor you have not seen him sometimes in his moods; and if to-morrow\\nmorning he was chased and hard pressed by the frigate, you would stand a\\npoor chance, suppose his eyes light upon you.  I can\\'t tink what make\\nhim to let you off, only but cause you give him de spy-glass in dat hold\\nway.  I tink I know a chap on board who understand dat--I go see--you\\nwait here till I come back.\"\\n\\nThe negro left me, and in a few minutes returned, with a sort of\\nhalf-Indian, half-negro-looking cut of fellow, with whom he conversed in\\nSpanish.\\n\\n\"He say he know how to make brown like himself but not dark same as me.\\nSuppose you wish he do it to-night--begin now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do wish it,\" replied I; and so I did sincerely, for I felt that\\nit might be the saving of my life; and I had a great aversion to be torn\\nto pieces by the sharks which followed the vessel, that being anything\\nbut an agreeable mode of going out of the world.\\n\\nThe American black remained with me, and we conversed for about half an\\nhour, by which time we were joined by the Spanish Main negro, who\\nbrought up with him some decoction or another, boiling hot.  They\\nstripped me and rubbed me all over with a bit of sponge, not only the\\nface and hands, but every part of my body and then I was left standing\\nquite naked to dry; the crew had gathered round us, and were very merry\\nat the idea of changing my colour.\\n\\nAs soon as the warm air had dried me, the application was created; and\\nwhen I was again dry, the American told me to put on my clothes, and\\nthat he would call me early to have two more applications of the stuff,\\nand that then I should be quite dark enough.\\n\\nI asked for Jose, and told him what the captain had said; he gave me a\\nbundle of matting for a bed, and I was soon fast asleep.  About three\\no\\'clock in the morning I was called up, and the staining repeated twice,\\nand I then lay down again.\\n\\nWhen the hands were turned up at five bells (for everything was very\\nregular on board), Jose brought me a glass to look at myself, and I was\\nquite satisfied that my colour would no longer annoy the captain.  I was\\nnot as black as a negro, but I was as dark as a mulatto.\\n\\nI asked the Spanish negro, through Jose, who could speak both languages,\\nwhether I might wash myself?  He replied, all day long if I pleased;\\nthat I should not get the colour off; it would wear off in time, and the\\nstuff must be applied once a month, and that would be sufficient.\\n\\nI went to the forecastle, and washed myself; the negro crew were much\\namused, and said that I now was a \"bel muchaco\"--a handsome boy.  I dare\\nsay they thought so--at all events, they appeared to be very friendly\\nwith me, and my staining myself gave them great satisfaction.  I was\\nsitting with Jose between decks when the cabin bell rang.\\n\\n\"You go,\" said he, showing his white teeth as he grinned; \"I go after,\\nsee what captain tink.\"\\n\\nI went into the cabin, and knocked at the state-room door.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said the captain.\\n\\nI went in, and met him face to face.\\n\\n\"What!\" said he, looking earnestly at me--\"yet it must be--it is you, is\\nit not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, \"it is me.  I\\'ve turned dark to please you, and I\\nhope it does please you.\"\\n\\n\"It does, boy, I can look at you now, and forget that you are white.  I\\ncan.  I feel that I can love you now--you\\'ve got rid of your only fault\\nin my eyes, and I\\'m not sorry.  I\\'m only glad that I did not--\"\\n\\n\"Give me to the sharks,\" said I, finishing his sentence.\\n\\n\"Exactly so; say no more about it.\"\\n\\nI immediately turned the conversation, by asking him what he required;\\nand I attended him while dressing.  From that time he became very\\nfriendly towards me, constantly conversing with me.  I did my duty as\\nhis servant for more than a fortnight, during which time we became very\\nintimate, and (I may as well confess it) I grew very fond of my new\\nmaster, and thought less about the ship and my shipmates.  We were going\\ninto a port, I knew, but what port I did not know.\\n\\nI often had conversations with Jose and the American black, and gained a\\ngreat deal of information from them; but I could not discover much of\\nthe history of the captain.  On that point they refused to be\\ncommunicative; occasionally hints were given, and then, as if\\nrecollecting themselves, they stopped speaking.\\n\\nIt was about three weeks before we made the land of Cuba, and as soon as\\nwe did so, the schooner was hove to till night, when sail was again\\nmade, and before ten o\\'clock we saw the lights of the Havannah.  When\\nabout three miles off we again hove to, and about midnight we perceived\\nunder the land the white sails of a schooner, which was standing out.\\nSail was made, and we ran down to her, and before she was aware that we\\nwere an enemy, she was laid by the board and in the possession of our\\ncrew.  The people belonging to the vessel were handed up, and she was\\nexamined.  She proved to be a vessel fitted out for the slave trade,\\nwith the manacles, etcetera, on board of her, and was just sailing for\\nthe coast.\\n\\nI was on the deck when the white men, belonging to the slaver, were\\nbrought on board, and never shall I forget the rage and fury of the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nAll sail was made upon both schooners, standing right off from the land,\\nand at daylight we had left it a long way astern.\\n\\nJose said to me, \"You better not go to captain dis day.  Keep out of his\\nway--perhaps he recollect dat you white.\"\\n\\nFrom what I had seen the night before, I thought this good advice; and I\\nnot only did not go into the cabin, but I did not show myself on deck.\\n\\nAbout eight o\\'clock in the morning I heard the boat lowered down and\\norders given to scuttle the vessel, as soon as she had been well\\nsearched.  This was done, and the boat returned, having found several\\nthousand dollars on board of her, which they handed upon deck.\\n\\nI remained below: I heard the angry voice of the negro captain--the\\npleadings and beggings for mercy of the prisoners--busy preparations\\nmaking on deck; and several men came down and handed up buckets of sand;\\nan iron grating was handed up.  The countenances of the negroes who were\\nthus employed appeared inflamed, as if their wrath was excited; now and\\nthen they laughed at each other, and looked more like demons than men.\\nThat some dreadful punishment was about to be inflicted I was certain\\nand I remained crouched behind the foremast on the lower-deck.\\n\\nAt last the men were all on deck again, and I was left alone; and then I\\nheard more noise, begging for mercy, weeping and wailing, and\\noccasionally a few words from the mouth of the negro captain; then rose\\nshrieks and screams, and appeals to Heaven, and a strong smell, which I\\ncould not comprehend, came down the hatchways.\\n\\nThe shrieks grew fainter, and at last ceased, and something was thrown\\noverboard.  Then the same tragedy, whatever it was, was acted over\\nagain--more attempts to obtain mercy--more shrieks--again the same\\noverpowering smell.  What could it be?  I would have given much to know,\\nbut something told me that I must remain where I was.  Ten times was\\nthis repeated, and then, as evening came on, there was a bustle on deck,\\nand after a time the crew descended the hatchways.\\n\\nI caught the eye of the American, with whom I was intimate, and as he\\npassed me, I beckoned to him.  He came to me.\\n\\n\"What has been done?\" said I in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Captain punish slave traders,\" replied he; \"always punish them so.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what did he do to them?\"\\n\\n\"Do?--roast \\'em alive.  Dis third slave vessel he take, and he always\\nserve \\'em so.  Serve \\'em right; captain very savage; no go to him till\\nmorrow morning--you keep close.\"  So saying, the American negro left me.\\n\\nAs I afterwards found out, the long boat on the booms had been cleared\\nout, the sand laid at the bottom to prevent the fire from burning the\\nboat, the captain and crew of the slave vessel laid on one after the\\nother upon the iron grating, and burnt alive.  This accounted for the\\nhorrible smell that had come down the hatchways.\\n\\nIt may be considered strange that I really did not feel so much horror\\nas perhaps I ought to have done.  Had this dreadful punishment been\\ninflicted upon any _other_ persons than slave dealers, and _by_ any\\nother parties than negroes, I should not have been able to look at the\\ncaptain without abhorrence expressed in my countenance; but I know well\\nthe horrors of the slave trade from conversation I had had with Bob\\nCross; and I had imbibed such a hatred against the parties who had\\ncarried it on, that it appeared to me to be an act of retaliation almost\\nallied to justice.  Had the negro captain only warred against slave\\ndealers, I do not think I should have cared about remaining in the\\nvessel; but he had told me and fully proved to me, that he detested all\\nwhite men, and had never spared them except in my own instance.\\n\\nI must acknowledge that I felt very much like going into the lion\\'s den,\\nwhen the next morning, on his ringing the cabin bell, I presented myself\\nto the captain; but so far from being in an ill-humour, he was very kind\\nto me.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, as I was going out, he said to me, \"You must have a\\nname: I shall call you Cato--recollect that; and now I have a question\\nto ask you--What is that which you carry round your neck on a ribbon?\"\\n\\n\"A letter, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"A letter! and why do you carry a letter?\"\\n\\n\"Because it is of the greatest importance to me.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Now, Cato, sit down on the other sofa, and let me know your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\nI felt that I could not do better than to make this man at once my\\nconfidant.  He might take a strong interest in me, and it was not likely\\nto go farther.  I therefore told him everything connected with my birth\\nand parentage, what my suspicions had been, and how the letter had\\nconfirmed them.  I unsewed the seal-skin, and gave him the letter to\\nread--without being aware that he could read: he took it and read it\\naloud.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"that\\'s proof under his own hand; and now, Cato, never\\nbe afraid of me, for, however I may wreak my vengeance upon others, I\\nswear _by my colour_ that I never will hurt you, or permit others to do\\nso.  I am a tiger--I know it; but you have often seen a little spaniel\\ncaressed by the tiger, whose fangs are turned against every other living\\nthing.  You are quite safe.\"\\n\\n\"I feel I am, since you say so,\" replied I; \"and since I am to be your\\npet, I shall take liberties, and ask you, in return, to tell me your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad that you have asked it, as I wish you to know it.  I will\\nbegin at once--\\n\\n\"I was born in America, in the state of Pennsylvania, of free parents.\\nMy father was a sail-maker, and was worth money; bet a free black in\\nAmerica is even worse treated and more despised than a slave.  I had two\\nbrothers, who went to school with me.\\n\\n\"My father intended to bring me up for the Church.  You look astonished;\\nbut in the States we have clergymen of our colour, as well as white\\nones; looked down upon and despised, I grant, although they do teach the\\nWord of God; but I was very unfit for that profession, as you may\\nsuppose.  I was very proud and haughty; I felt that I was as good as a\\nwhite man, and I very often got into scrapes from my resenting injuries.\\n\\n\"However, my education went on successfully, much more so than that of\\nmy brothers, who could not learn.  I could, and learnt rapidly but I\\nlearnt to hate and detest white men, and more especially Americans; I\\nbrooded over the injuries of people of colour, as we were called, and\\nall my father\\'s advice and entreaty could not persuade me to keep my\\nthoughts to myself.  As I grew up to manhood, I spoke boldly, and more\\nthan once nearly lost my life for so doing; for most Americans think no\\nmore of taking the life of one like me than of a dog in the street.\\nMore than one knife has been directed to my heart, and more than once\\nwas I then up before the judge, and sentenced to imprisonment for no\\nfault; my evidence, and the evidence of those of my colour, not being\\npermitted to be received in a court of justice.  Any white villain had\\nonly to swear falsely--and there is no want of that class in America--\\nand there was no appeal.  At last I was sentenced to be whipped; then my\\nblood boiled, and I vowed a vengeance which I have fearfully adhered\\nto.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wonder at that,\" said I; \"I would have done the same.\"\\n\\n\"The man who had sworn falsely against me in this last instance had come\\nup from the South; I obtained what money I could from my father, and\\nwent away in pursuit of him.  I found him--dogged him, and one evening I\\naccosted him, and plunged my bowie-knife into his heart.  I fled that\\nState, and crossed the Mississippi.\\n\\n\"I had not been long in Arkansas before a man--a cotton-grower, who\\nowned about a hundred and fifty slaves--inquired who I was, and whether\\nI had a pass; I replied that I was a free man, born in Pennsylvania, and\\nwas there on my own affairs.  The next day I was taken up, brought\\nbefore the magistrate, and this scoundrel swore that I was his slave,\\nand had absconded from him ten years before.\\n\\n\"My defence--the proof which I offered to bring, was not listened to.  I\\nwas made over to him, and the rascal grinned as the constables brought\\nme away with him.  His plantation was at the Red River.  It was\\ndifficult to escape and indeed, almost useless to attempt it: but the\\nfact was, that I did not wish to do so; I remained to have my revenge.\\nI tried to make the other slaves rise against him, but they were too\\ncowed; they even informed against me, and I was tied down, and flogged\\nby the drivers until the flesh fell from my shoulders.\\n\\n\"As soon as I recovered, I determined to do--or die.  I heard that there\\nwere some pirate vessels in the Barataria lagoons on the other side of\\nNew Orleans; I resolved to join the crews, but first to have my revenge.\\nI did so: I set fire to the plantation house--struck the scoundrel who\\nhad made me a slave senseless as he attempted to escape, and threw his\\nbody into the flames; I then made the door fast, and fled.  I was met by\\none of the overseers, who was armed, and who would have stopped me: I\\nbeat his brains out with his own musket, and then gained the woods.  You\\nsee that I am powerful; you hardly know how much so.  After several\\ndays\\' travelling, I arrived at the lagoons.  I found this very vessel at\\nanchor.  I offered myself, and they accepted me immediately.\\n\\n\"There were several of my colour on board--runaway slaves--and all good\\ndetermined men.  These were the people I required, for they understood\\nme.  Even on board of a pirate vessel, the same contempt was shown\\ntowards us--still considered as inferior beings.  All the heavy work all\\nthe dirty work, was for the negro race; and we often worked like slaves,\\nwhile the captain and the rest of the crew caroused.  I was three years\\non board of this vessel.  Our rendezvous where we are going to now, is a\\nsmall land-locked bay on the island of Cuba.  No vessel in it can be\\nseen from seaward, and there is but one narrow pass by which it\\ncommunicates with the interior, and it is far from any habitation.  A\\nbetter retreat for a pirate vessel could not well be found.  We used\\nvery often to go in to refit, and take in provisions and water; for in a\\ncave there, we keep the provisions which we take from other vessels.\\n\\n\"In a desperate fight which we had with an English man-of-war brig, we\\nlost nearly forty of our men.  The captain, Chico, as he was called, was\\nobliged to fill up with black men, until he could procure others.  The\\nconsequence was, that with the ten before on board, there were fifty\\nblacks to seventy whites.  It was then that I made up my mind that I\\nwould retaliate for all that my race had suffered.  I was sure of the\\nten with whom I had sailed so long; I sounded the others, and found them\\nall willing.\\n\\n\"We sailed from the Mexican Gulf, and made for the Rendezvous Bay, in\\nCuba.  As soon as we arrived, of course, as with all pirate vessels, the\\nfirst day was dedicated to revelling and intoxication--that is, by the\\nwhite portion of the crew.  We negroes were employed in getting the\\ncasks ashore for water.  That very night, when they all lay asleep and\\ndrunk, we put every soul of them to death, and the Stella belonged to me\\nand my brave black who chose me for their captain, and swore by their\\nwrongs eternal enmity to the European race.\\n\\n\"As you may suppose, I was short-manned; but we soon found plenty of\\nmen, and have now as fine a crew as ever trod a deck.\"\\n\\n\"How long is it since you took possession of the vessel?\"\\n\\n\"About eight or nine months, during which time I have spared none except\\nyou.  The usual death is drowning; but if I fall in with a slaver,\\nthen--you know what took place yesterday.\"\\n\\nI was silent for a time.  \"I do not wonder,\" said I, at last, \"at your\\nhatred of the whites, especially of the Americans.  As for your wreaking\\nyour vengeance upon those employed in the slave trade, dreadful as it\\nis, I scarcely pity them; but in your general warfare against the\\nwhites, recollect that you may murder those who are your friends, and\\nwho have done all they can to put an end to slavery.  Even in America,\\nthere are many who are opposed to it.\"\\n\\n\"It is impossible to make a distinction,\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I, musing.\\n\\n\"Why do you ask?  You may as well know; I wish it to be known: it is\\nJames Vincent.\"\\n\\n\"But tell me, if you were to meet with a very superior force, what would\\nyou do?\"\\n\\n\"Run if I could; if not, fight.\"\\n\\n\"But you might be captured, and then--\"\\n\\n\"Never, boy; never.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"as you have begun by sparing me, I hope you will spare\\nothers now.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why I spared you.  Had you shown any fear of death I\\nshould not have done so; but I felt that you would not care about it.  I\\nbelieve it was that.\"\\n\\nAbout ten days after, we made the east end of the island of Cuba, and\\nran into the Bay of Rendezvous, as it was named by the pirate.  It was\\nvery small, but completely land-locked, and the land so high on every\\nside that the masts of the vessel could not be seen from the seaward.\\nThe bay on the land side was met by a deep, narrow ravine, between\\nmountains which were almost perpendicular, the ravine itself being\\naccessible from the main land by only one narrow path known to the\\npirates, and which they seldom made use of, except when a spy was sent\\nto the Havannah to ascertain what vessels were about to sail.\\n\\nOn the high land which shut in the bay from the sea, the pirates had a\\nman constantly on the look-out, to report any vessel which might be in\\nthe offing, and Vincent himself passed much of his time there, as the\\nbreeze was fresh and the air cool to what it was down in the land-locked\\nbay.  I was, for the same reason, very fond of being on the look-out\\nhill, and generally followed up the captain when he went out there.  He\\ncertainly now showed a strong affection for me, and I liked him better\\nthan I ever thought I could have done.  He was constantly telling me of\\nthe treatment he and the other poor blacks had received in America, and\\nI could not help feeling my blood boil, and a conviction that, had I\\nbeen so treated, I should probably have been equally under the influence\\nof revenge.  It is the world, and the treatment we receive from it,\\nwhich makes us chiefly what we are.\\n\\nOne day the captain told me he was going that evening to obtain\\ninformation, as the spy he had sent had returned unsuccessful, and that\\nhe should be absent for three or four days.\\n\\nAlthough I was not discontented with my position, still, as the reader\\nmay well suppose, I had a strong wish to be out of it as soon as\\npossible, and I had determined to escape if I could; it immediately\\noccurred to me, that his absence would give me the opportunity.\\n\\nI replied with a laugh, \"Had you not better take me with you?\"\\n\\n\"Very likely, indeed, you would be so very useful; I shall have quite\\nenough to do to take care of myself; besides, you might betray me,\"\\nadded he, with a fierce and penetrating look.\\n\\n\"Thank you, for your good opinion,\" replied I, indignantly.  \"So you\\nthink, because you have saved my life, that I would take yours.  I am\\nnot yet such a rascal, whatever I may become by keeping bad company.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" replied the negro captain, \"I believe I am wrong, so don\\'t\\nget into a passion; but, at all events, you must see that it is\\nimpossible I can take you with me.\"\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t choose, I can\\'t help it,\" said I; \"but I don\\'t like\\nremaining here without you; I shall run away if I can, so I give you\\nfair warning.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t find that quite so easy,\" replied he, laughing; \"and I\\nrecommend you not to attempt it.\"\\n\\nHere the conversation dropped.  About midnight the captain commenced his\\nascent of the ravine, and I resolved that I would not lose the\\nopportunity, if it offered, of following him.  I watched him as long as\\nI could see him, that I might know the direction of the secret path, and\\nthen I joined the crew, who were lying down by the tents which they had\\npitched on the shore.  Shortly afterwards, the Spanish Indian, who had\\ncoloured me, passed by me, and, as I intended to make the attempt before\\nit was quite dark, I thought that I would remove any suspicion, and I\\ntherefore requested him to stain me again.  This he consented to do, and\\nin half an hour I was again naked among the negroes and undergoing the\\noperation.  Having received the two applications, as before, I then\\nquitted them.\\n\\nAs soon as it was quite dark, I armed myself with a pair of pistols, and\\ncrawled underneath the back of the captain\\'s tent, in which I always\\nslept, and, without being perceived, gained the narrow path in the\\nbrushwood by which the captain had left.\\n\\nI continued in the path for some time, by feeling the brushwood on\\neither side; but before I had crawled half way up the ravine, I found\\nthat the brushwood had not been cut away any farther and I was at a loss\\nhow to proceed.  All traces were gone, and all I had to do was to climb\\nup to the summit, and to take my chance of finding any egress.  I toiled\\non with difficulty, sometimes stopped by a rock which would take me\\nminutes to climb over at others, holding on by the brushwood for my\\nlife.  By twelve o\\'clock I had gained more than two-thirds of the\\nascent, and then the moon rose, and assisted me with her light.  I must\\nsay, that when I looked up and saw the rocks towering above me, and\\noverhanging my path, I felt that escape was nearly impossible: however,\\nI recommenced my labour, and gained some ground, when, as I was clinging\\nto the side of a rock by a small shrub, it gave way, and I rolled and\\nfell down many feet, between that rock and another opposite to it.\\n\\nI was not much hurt, and I regained my legs.  Looking up and about me, I\\nfound that I was in a narrow passage, between the rocks, leading both up\\nand down--in fact, I had tumbled into the secret path that I had been in\\nsearch of.  Delighted with this discovery, I now set off with great\\nspirit, and in half an hour found myself on the other side of the lull\\nwhich formed the ravine, and looking down upon an expanse of country in\\nthe interior.  Being very tired, I sat down, that I might recover my\\nstrength before I continued my journey.\\n\\n\"I am free at last,\" thought I, and my memory wandered back to my mother\\nmy ship, and my captain--old Culpepper, Tommy Dott, and Bob Cross.  \"I\\nshall see them all,\" I thought, \"and what a story I shall have to tell.\"\\nAs soon as I had rested myself and recovered my breath, I thought I\\nmight as well start.\\n\\nI had not proceeded more than a hundred yards before I thought heard a\\nnoise, as if some one was approaching.  I listened--I felt sure that\\nsuch was the case, and I also heard the deep baying of a hound.  The\\nnoise increased rapidly--it was that of one forcing his way through the\\nbrushwood, which covered the side of the hill.\\n\\nIn a minute afterwards I perceived a man coming up the hill at a swift\\npace, directly towards me.  As he approached I could almost swear that\\nit was Vincent, the negro captain; but when within ten yards of me, I\\nperceived, him turn round and flourish his sabre in the air, while, at\\nthe same time, three large bloodhounds sprang at him.  One fell by the\\nblow of his sabre, but the other two flew at his throat, and fastened on\\nhim, tearing him to the around, and holding him in spite of all his\\nstruggling and his immense strength.\\n\\nI recollected my pistols: I cocked them, ran up, and putting one to the\\nhead of the nearest dog, blew out its brains.  I was equally successful\\nwith the other--they both lay dead by his side, and Vincent was\\nreleased.  He started up.\\n\\n\"It is me, Cato,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Cato!\" replied he; \"but there is not a moment to be lost.  I understand\\nit all.\"\\n\\nHe seized me by the arm, and dragged me with him to the narrow entrance\\nof the pass, and as soon as we came in he rolled three large rocks,\\nwhich had evidently been used for such purpose before, so as completely\\nto block up the entrance.\\n\\n\"There,\" said he, leaning back quite exhausted; \"be quiet, Cato.  We are\\nsafe now; they will be on the top of the hill directly.\"\\n\\nWe remained where we were about ten minutes, when we heard voices not\\nvery far from us.  They were the pursuers of the negro captain who were\\nevidently baffled.  After a time the sounds receded from us, and we\\nheard them no more.  Vincent then spoke:--\\n\\n\"You were escaping, Cato.\"\\n\\n\"I had escaped,\" replied I: \"I told you that I would.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that you should have discovered the path; did any one betray it\\nto you?\"\\n\\n\"No one,\" replied I: and I then told him how I had fallen into it.\\n\\n\"Well you have returned all obligations, and more than ever you owed\\nme,\" said he: \"you have saved my life this time, and that when all\\nchance was over.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" replied I, \"although I shall be very sorry to part with you,\\ngive me that liberty which I had gained, and which I lost in defending\\nyou from the dogs.\"\\n\\n\"I would have let you go then, Cato,\" replied he, \"but your life would\\nhave been sacrificed.  My pursuers would have hurried you to prison\\nbefore you could have explained who you were.  You forget your colour is\\nchanged; they were not seeking me, but a runaway slave, and the\\nbloodhounds came upon my track.  Those white men show no mercy; they\\nhave more pleasure in seeing a runaway slave torn to pieces by those\\ndogs than in recovering possession of him.  It is a sort of fox-chase to\\nthem,\" continued he, grating his teeth after he had said so.  \"Cato, I\\nwill give you your liberty, if you wish it, and I know you do wish it,\\nas soon as I can with any prudence; that I promise you, and you know\\nthat I will keep my word.\"\\n\\n\"I am quite satisfied,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"And do you promise me that you will not attempt to escape a second\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\"I promise you that I will not,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" said Vincent.  \"Now let us go down the hill, for I am very\\nmuch torn by those infernal brutes, and must have the wounds washed and\\nattended to.\"\\n\\nWe descended the hill, in silence, and in a quarter of an hour had\\ngained the tent.  Vincent was severely bitten and torn: as soon as his\\nwounds had been dressed he lay down on his mat, and I did the same.\\n\\nIt was some days before Vincent recovered from the severe injuries which\\nhe had received from the bloodhounds; and he did not appear to be\\ninclined to run any more risks of that sort.  Although he said little, I\\ncould perceive that he was brooding over future vengeance and he was now\\nnearly the whole of the day with his glass on the look-out hill.\\n\\nOne morning a schooner hove in sight, steering from the Havannah to the\\nsouthward and eastward, either for the islands of the Spanish Main.  The\\nStella had for many days been ready for instant sailing, and having\\nwatched her till near sunset, Vincent sent down orders for every soul to\\nbe on board, and the anchor hove up.  Just as it was dark we towed out\\nof the bay, and made all sail.\\n\\nAt daylight the schooner was but a few miles ahead of us and not being a\\nfast sailer, in little more than an flour we were alongside of her.  She\\nproved to be bound to the island of Curacao, being the property of an\\nold Dutch gentleman, who was on board with his daughter, a little girl\\nabout seven years old.  The crew consisted chiefly of negroes, slaves to\\nthe owner; the master of the vessel and the mate being, with the\\nexception of the old gentleman and the little girl, the only white\\npeople on board.\\n\\nAs usual, the crew were brought on board by the pirates, who reported to\\nthe captain that the vessel was in ballast, and of no value.  As the\\ncrew of the Stella were already more than requisite, Vincent did not\\nrequire the negroes; he told them that they might go on board the\\nschooner again, and take her into any port they pleased; with the white\\npeople, however it was another affair.\\n\\nI had remained below, not wishing to witness a scene of butchery; but I\\nwas induced to look up the ladder, in consequence of Jose telling me\\nthat there was a little white girl come on board.  At the time that I\\ndid so, Vincent had just done speaking with the negroes belonging to the\\ncaptured vessel; they had fallen back, and there was then standing\\nbefore Vincent, the master and mate of the vessel, the old Dutch\\ngentleman, and the little girl.\\n\\nA more interesting child I never had seen, and my heart bled at the idea\\nof her being sacrificed.  I could not help hoping that Vincent would\\nhave a similar feeling, but I was mistaken.  The master and mate were\\npointed at, and immediately seized by negroes and tossed over into the\\nsea.  The old gentleman bowed his head over the beautiful child, and she\\nknelt to him, as if for his blessing before she died.  At that very\\nmoment Vincent gave the sign--I could remain quiet to longer--I sprang\\non the deck.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried I to the men who were about to seize the old\\ngentleman--\"stop!\"  The negroes did fall back at my voice.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Vincent.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" cried I, \"do you call yourself a man, to war with\\nchildren and old grey-headed men?  You must not, shall not, touch these\\ntwo.  You have wreaked your vengeance upon the white men; be content--\\nlet these go.\"\\n\\n\"Cato,\" replied Vincent, fiercely, \"it is well that it is you that have\\ndared to snatch the prey from the fangs of the wild beast.  Had it been\\nanother, this pistol should have sent a ball whizzing through his brain;\\nas it is, go down below immediately.\"\\n\\n\"I do not fear your pistol, Captain Vincent, nor will I go below; that\\nvery pistol, in my hand, saved you from the fangs of the blood-hound.  I\\ntell you, therefore, that you must not destroy that innocent child--if\\nyou love me, you must not; for I will hate, detest, and scorn you ever\\nafterwards.  I entreat you--I implore you to let them go: they are not\\nfit objects for your vengeance; and if you destroy them, I tell you, you\\nare a coward.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" roared the tiger, \"a coward!\" and, no longer able to contain\\nhimself he levelled his pistol at me and drew the trigger.  It missed\\nfire; Vincent looked very confused--he tossed the pistol on deck, folded\\nhis arms and turned his face away.\\n\\nThere was a dead silence.  The negro crew looked first at me and then at\\nthe captain, as if awaiting orders, and uncertain of the issue.  The\\nDutch gentleman seemed to be so lost in surprise, as to almost forget\\nhis impending fate; while the little girl clung to him and stared at me\\nwith her deep blue eyes.  It was what on the theatres they would call a\\ntableau.\\n\\nI followed up my advantage.  Stepping forward, and placing myself before\\nthe old man and the child, I first broke the silence.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" said I, \"you did once promise me that you would never\\ninjure me or attempt my life; that promise you have broken.  Since that,\\nyou have made me another promise--you may recollect it--which was, that\\nyou would allow me to leave you on the first favourable opportunity;\\nthere cannot be any opportunity more favourable than the present.  The\\nnegroes whom you are to send back to the schooner do not know how to\\nnavigate her.  I request, therefore, to know whether you intend to keep\\nthis second promise, or to break it as you have the first?  I ask my\\nliberty.\"\\n\\n\"If I broke my promise just now, it was your fault,\" replied Vincent,\\ncoolly.  \"I am sorry for it, and I can say no more; I intended to keep\\nit, and, to prove so, I now keep my second--you may go.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for that.  I only wish that, now I leave you, I could leave\\nyou with feelings of good-will and not of--I must say it--of horror and\\ndisgust.  Captain Vincent, once more let me beg, as a last favour, that\\nyou will spare these poor people.\"\\n\\n\"Since you are so particularly interested about this useless old man and\\nstill more useless child,\" replied Vincent, sarcastically, \"I will now\\nmake a proposal to you.  You have your liberty.  Do you choose to give\\nit up and remain here, provided I let them go away in the schooner?\\nCome now--take your choice; for I swear by my colour, that if you go\\naway in the schooner, the moment you shove off, they shall go over the\\ngunwale.\"\\n\\n\"My choice is then made,\" replied I; for I knew that when he swore by\\nhis colour he was in earnest: \"release them, and I will remain here.\"  I\\nlittle knew what I was to undergo in consequence of this decision.\\n\\n\"Be it so,\" said Vincent: then turning to one of the mates, \"let them go\\nback with the negroes; hoist the boat up when she returns, and sail for\\nthe Rendezvous.\"  So saying, he went down into the cabin.\\n\\n\"You are saved,\" said I, going up to the old Dutch gentleman; \"lose no\\ntime; get into the boat as fast as possible, and make sail on your\\nvessel as soon as you get on board.  Good bye, little girl,\" said I,\\ntaking her hand.\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" replied the gentleman in good English--\"I cannot say how\\nmuch; I am so surprised at what I have seen but recollect the name of\\nVanderwelt, of Curacao; and if ever we meet again, you will find me\\ngrateful.\"\\n\\n\"I will; but ask no more questions now--into the boat--quick,\" said I,\\nshaking his proffered hand.  They were handed down into the boat by the\\nnegroes.\\n\\nI remained on deck until they were put on board; the boat returned, was\\nhoisted up, the schooner made sail again, and then I went down into the\\ncabin.  I found the negro captain stretched upon the sofa, his face\\ncovered up with both his hands; he remained in the same position, taking\\nno notice of my coming down.  Although my confidence in him was\\ndestroyed after his snapping the pistol at me, yet when I reflected how\\nI had bearded him in his rage, I did make some excuse for him; moreover,\\nI knew that it was my interest to be on the best terms with him, and, if\\npossible, make him forget what had passed, for I felt that his proud\\nspirit would make it difficult for him to forgive himself for having\\nbeen induced by his passion to break an oath which he had sworn to by\\nhis colour; I therefore, after a little reflection, went up to him and\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"I am sorry that I made you so angry, Captain Vincent; you must forgive\\nme, but I thought that deed beneath you, and I could not bear to have a\\nbad opinion of you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to assert that you have not a bad opinion of me now?\"\\nreplied he, fixing his eyes upon me.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; you have released those I pleaded for, and I am very\\ngrateful to you for having done so.\"\\n\\n\"You have made me do what I never did before,\" replied he, raising\\nhimself and sitting with his feet on the deck.\\n\\n\"I know I have; I have made you spare those of my colour.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean that; you have irritated me so as to make me break my\\noath.\"\\n\\n\"That was my own doing--my fault rather than yours.  I had no right to\\nspeak as I did; but I was in a great rage, and that is the truth.  I do\\nbelieve that, if I had had a pistol in my hand, I should have fired it\\nat you; so we may cry quits on that score.\"\\n\\n\"I am angry with myself--the more so, that I little imagined that you\\nwould have remained with me after my breaking my oath.  Either you must\\nhave felt great interest about those people, or you must have great\\nconfidence in me, a confidence winch I have proved that I do not\\ndeserve.\"\\n\\n\"That you did forget yourself, I grant; but I have that confidence that\\nit will be a warning to you, and you will not forget yourself again; I\\ntherefore remain with you with perfect confidence, feeling I am quite\\nsafe, until you think proper to give me my liberty.\"\\n\\n\"You will wish to leave me then?\"\\n\\n\"I have relations and friends--a profession to follow.  What can I gain\\nby remaining here, except your friendship?  I never will be a pirate,\\nyou may be assured, I wish from my heart that you were not one.\"\\n\\n\"And who should be pirates if the blacks are not?\" replied Vincent.\\n\"Have they not the curse of Cain?  Are they not branded?  Ought not\\ntheir hands to be against every one but their own race?  What is the\\nArab but the pirate of the desert--the sea of sand?  Black is the colour\\nfor pirates.  Even the white pirates feel the truth of this, or why do\\nthey hoist the _black_ flag?\"\\n\\n\"At all events, it\\'s a profession that seldom ends well.\"\\n\\n\"And what matter does that make?  We can die but once--I care not how\\nsoon.  I have not found life so very sweet as to care for it, I assure\\nyou.  Cato, there is but one thing sweet in existence--one feeling that\\nnever clogs and never tires, and that is revenge.\"\\n\\n\"Are not love and friendship sweet?  I certainly know nothing about the\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"I know no more than you do of it.  They say friendship is the more\\nlasting; and as a proof of how lasting that is I snapped my pistol at\\nyou, and, had it not missed fire, should have killed the only one for\\nwhom I ever felt friendship in this world.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bad habit you have of carrying your pistols at all times; they\\nare too handy, and give no time or reflection.  Only suppose, now, you\\nhad blown out my brains, you would have been very sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Cato, I have many lives on my hands, and hope to have many more before\\nI die.  I never have repented one act of my life--a murder, as you may\\ncall it--and I never shall.  But I tell you frankly, that had I\\ndestroyed you in my passion I should have been a miserable man.  I know\\nit; I feel it.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s say no more about it: that I\\'m just as glad as you are that you\\ndid not kill me, I assure you most positively.  Here\\'s Jose coming with\\nthe dinner.\"\\n\\nHere ended our conversation, which I have given just to show the\\npeculiar disposition of this extraordinary man, with whom I had become\\ndomesticated.  Verily and truly was I, as he said, \"like a little dog in\\nthe cage of a tiger,\" and, from familiarity: just as bold as dogs become\\nunder such peculiar circumstances.\\n\\nBefore morning we were again at anchor in the Rendezvous Bay, and the\\ntents were pitched as before.  We remained there for more than a\\nfortnight, during which my intimacy with the captain was even greater\\nthan before.  He appeared to endeavour to do all in his power to restore\\nmy confidence in him, and he succeeded.  Still, I must say, that I began\\nto be weary of this sort of life.  My dreams were ever of murder and\\nbloodshed; and more than once I felt inclined to make my escape: but I\\nhad promised, and the remembrance of my promise prevented me.\\n\\nOne afternoon the man on the look-out made the usual signal for a vessel\\nin sight.  Vincent went up immediately, and I followed him.  It was a\\nschooner, very long, with very taut, raking masts.  Vincent examined her\\nfor some time, and then gave me the glass, and asked me what I thought\\nof her.  I replied, that I thought she was a man-of-war schooner.\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said he, \"I know her well; it is the Arrow, and she has\\ncome out to cruise for me.  This is the third time that she has been\\nsent after me.  Once we exchanged a few broadsides, but another\\nman-of-war hove in sight, and I was compelled to leave her.  She shall\\nnot accuse me of running from her, now that she is alone, and by\\nto-morrow morning I will give her the opportunity of making the report\\nof my capture if she can; but if I capture her, you may guess the rest.\"\\n\\nWe remained till nearly sunset watching the motions of the schooner.\\nVincent then went down the hill to give orders for sailing, leaving me\\nwith the glass.  I again directed it to the schooner, and perceived that\\nshe was making signals.\\n\\nThen she is not alone, thought I; and Vincent may not capture her quite\\nso easily as he expects.  I looked in vain for the other vessel; I could\\nnot see her; I therefore concluded that she must be somewhere under the\\nland, and hidden by it from my sight.\\n\\nThe signals were repeated till dusk when I went down the hill, and found\\nthat all was bustle and activity, Vincent superintending himself the\\npreparations for sailing.  I did not interrupt him to tell him that I\\nhad perceived the schooner making signals.  I had an idea, somehow or\\nanother, that I should regain my liberty, and was as anxious as Vincent\\nthat the Stella should be under weigh.\\n\\nBefore ten o\\'clock everything was ready.  Vincent had told his men that\\nthe English man-of-war schooner was outside, and that he intended to\\nfight her; the men appeared delighted at the proposal, and as resolute\\nand determined as men should be.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella was clear of the bay, everything was got ready for\\naction, and I must say that nothing could be more rapid or more quiet\\nthan their movements.  We stood out until we had gained an offing of\\nfive miles, and then made a reach along the shore towards the Havannah.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella had laid her head towards the Havannah, Vincent\\ncame down below.  I had latterly slept on one of the cabin sofas, but\\nhad this night remained with my clothes on, for I was not sure that we\\nmight not be in action before the morning.\\n\\nThe Arrow had gained the knowledge that our Rendezvous Bay was somewhere\\nabout the east end of the island, and had cruised accordingly, but could\\nnot discover it.\\n\\nVincent threw himself on the other sofa, and I pretended to asleep; as I\\ndid not wish to enter into conversation with him was too much occupied\\nwith my own thoughts, and felt that there would be nothing in common\\nbetween us at such a moment.  He was very soon asleep, and he talked in\\nhis sleep.  He was evidently in action, and gave his orders, every now\\nand then speaking a few words aloud, and then it appeared as if he had\\ntaken the English schooner, and that he was fulfilling his vows of\\nretaliation.  I shuddered as I heard the half-broken menaces--the\\nexulting laugh which occasionally burst from his lips.  I arose and\\nwatched him as he slept; his hands were continually in motion, and his\\nfists clenched, and he smiled.  Merciful Heaven! what a tale of savage\\ncruelty that smile foretold if he were successful!  I knelt down and\\nprayed that he might be foiled in his endeavours.  As I rose I heard a\\nnoise and talking on deck, and one of the mates came down in the cabin.\\n\\n\"How does she bear?\" cried Vincent, starting up from his couch, as if he\\ninstinctively knew what was to be told.\\n\\n\"Two points on the weather bow, captain,\" replied the negro.  \"I think\\nshe has her foresheet to windward.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the time?\"\\n\\n\"One bell in the morning watch; it will be daylight in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Very good.  How far is she off?\"\\n\\n\"About four miles.\"\\n\\n\"Pipe to quarters; I will be up directly.\"\\n\\nVincent took down his sword and buckled on his belt; then his pistols,\\nwhich after having examined the primings, he fixed in his girdle.  I\\nstill remained as if asleep, and as he was going out of the cabin, he\\nturned to me.  \"He sleeps, poor boy; well, why should I wake him?--the\\nguns will rouse him up soon enough.\"  So saying, he went on deck.\\n\\nI considered what I should do.  To be on deck was hardly safe for me as\\na white person; and, indeed, what business had I there?  Why should I\\nexpose myself to the shot of my countrymen, or run the risk of losing my\\nlife from the rage of the negroes?  I therefore resolved on remaining\\nwhere I was--at all events, for the present.\\n\\nThe negroes now came into the cabin, for the after-magazine was under\\nthe forepart of it.  The hatch was taken up, the screens let down, and\\nall was dark.  I had nothing to do but to catch now and then the\\ncommands given by the negro captain, and draw my inference as to what\\nwas taking place.\\n\\nAlthough for the first half-hour I gained little information, after that\\ntime had elapsed I knew what was going on.  I heard a voice hailing us\\nfrom another vessel, and the reply of the Stella was a broadside.  There\\ncould be no mistake in that.  The Stella was then put about, and the\\nother broadside given without a return from her opponent.  At last it\\ncame, and as the shot whizzed over or tore up the planking of the\\ngunwales, I certainly did feel very strangely.  I had never been in\\naction before, and the sensation was, I confess, that of alarm; but it\\nwas so mingled with curiosity as to what was going on, that it was\\nimpossible to say what my feelings were.  I longed to be on deck, and\\ncertainly would have been, if I had thought that I was safe with the\\npirate crew: that alone prevented me; I remained, therefore, in a most\\nunpleasant state of ignorance and suspense.\\n\\nThe broadsides were now exchanged rapidly and the wounded, brought down\\nbetween decks every minute, told me that the action was severe.  The\\norders of the negro captain were occasionally heard--they were cool and\\ndetermined.  Every minute some fresh manoeuvre was executed, and the\\nguns still worked as if there was nothing else to attend to.  At last,\\nthe daylight came down the hatchway, and I left the cabin and walked\\nforward between decks; I found the deck strewed with wounded and dying\\nmen, calling for water.  I was glad to be able to do something which I\\ncould consistently do, and I brought water from the cask and gave it to\\nthem, one after another, as fast as I could; I think there were at least\\nthirty men lying about the lower deck, some in pools of their own blood,\\nand sinking fast, for there was no surgeon on board of the Stella.\\n\\nSome more wounded men were brought down, and a conversation took place\\nbetween one of the mates of the schooner, who was hurt, and the men who\\nbrought down the wounded, and listening to them, I found that at\\ndaylight they had discovered that an English frigate was under all sail,\\nbeating up to them, and about five miles to leeward; that in\\nconsequence, the Stella was now carrying on a running fight with the\\nschooner (who was to windward of her), and trying to escape.  This\\naccounted for the signals which I had perceived that the English\\nschooner was making the evening before.  My anxiety at this intelligence\\nwas naturally much increased.  The Stella was trying to escape, and her\\nsailing powers were so remarkable, that I was afraid she would succeed.\\n\\nThe action was still continued between the two schooners, but now the\\nshot no longer hit the Stella, nor were there any more wounded men\\nbrought down; it was evident that the two vessels were now firing at\\neach other\\'s masts and rigging, the one to prevent, and the other to\\neffect her escape, by dismantling her antagonist.  I felt as if I could\\nhave given my left hand to have gone on deck.  I waited half an hour\\nmore, and then, curiosity conquering my fear, I crept gradually up the\\nfore ladder.  The men were working the guns to windward, the lee-side of\\nthe deck was clear, and I stepped forward, and got into the head, where\\nI could see both to windward and to leeward.  To leeward I perceived the\\nfrigate about four miles distant with every stretch of canvass that she\\ncould set on a wind; I knew her directly to be the Calliope, my own\\nship, and my heart beat quick at the chance of being once more on board\\nof her.\\n\\nTo windward, as the smoke occasionally cleared away, I saw the Arrow\\nschooner close hauled on the same tack as the Stella, and distant about\\na mile, every ten seconds the smoke from her guns booming along the\\nwater\\'s surface, and the shot whizzing through our rigging; she had not\\nsuffered much from our fire: her sails were full of shot-holes, it is\\ntrue, but her spars were not injured.  I then turned my eyes upon the\\nmasts and rigging of the Stella: apparently, the damage done was about\\nequal to that received by the Arrow; our sails were torn, but our spars\\nwere unscathed.\\n\\nThe water was smooth, although the breeze was fresh, and both schooners\\nwere running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but the Stella\\nhad evidently the advantage of sailing, and fore-reached upon her\\nopponent.  I perceived that everything depended upon a lucky hit and\\nhaving satisfied myself with what I had seen, I hastened down below.\\n\\nFor more than half an hour the firing continued without advantage on\\neither side, when a yell was given by the negro crew, and I heard them\\ncry on the deck that the Arrow\\'s foretop-mast was shot away.  I heard\\nthe voice of Vincent cheering his men, and telling them to be steady in\\ntheir aim.  My heart sunk at the intelligence, and I sat down on a\\nchest.\\n\\nThe firing now slackened, for the Stella had shot ahead of the English\\nschooner, and the negroes on deck were laughing and in high good-humour.\\nFor a few minutes the firing ceased altogether, and I took it for\\ngranted that the Stella had left her pursuers far behind; when of a\\nsudden, a whole broadside of guns were poured into us, and there was a\\nterrible crashing and confusion on the deck.\\n\\nI ran up the ladder to see what had happened.  It appeared that as the\\nStella was crossing the bows of the Arrow, the latter had, as a last\\nchance thrown up in the wind, and discharged her whole broadside into\\nus: two shots had struck our mainmast, which had fallen by the board.  I\\nperceived at once that the Stella\\'s chance was over--nothing could save\\nher; she might resist the schooner but could not escape the frigate.\\n\\nI ran down below, and went into the cabin; I was afraid that the negroes\\nmight perceive the joy in my countenance.  I heard the angry voice of\\nthe negro captain--I heard him stamping with rage, and I thanked God\\nthat I was not by his side.  The wreck of the mast was soon cleared\\naway; I heard him address his negroes, point out to them that it was\\nbetter to die like men at the guns, than swing at the yard-arm like\\ndogs.  Some of them came down and took on deck a quarter-cask of\\nspirits, which was plentifully supplied to all.\\n\\nThe English schooner had borne down upon us, and the action now\\ncommenced at pistol-shot.  Never shall I forget what took place for\\nnearly three-quarters of an hour; the negroes, most of them intoxicated,\\nfought with rage and fury indescribable--their shouts--their screams--\\ntheir cursing and blasphemy, mingled with the loud report of the guns,\\nthe crashing of the spars and bulwarks, the occasional cry of the\\nwounded, and the powerful voice of Vincent.  It was terrific between\\ndecks; the smoke was so thick, that those who came down for the powder\\ncould not see, but felt their way to the screen.  Every two seconds, I\\nheard the men come aft, toss off the can of liquor, and throw it on the\\ndeck, hen they went to resume their labour at their guns.\\n\\nAt the end of the time I have mentioned, the shot flew from to leeward,\\nas well as from to windward: the frigate had got within range, and was\\npouring in her broadside; still the firing and the shouting on the deck\\nof the Stella continued, but the voices were fewer; and as the firing of\\nthe frigate became more severe, they became fainter and fainter; and at\\nlast but an occasional gun was fired from our decks.\\n\\nI became so uneasy, that I could remain where I was no longer; I went\\nforward on the lower deck again, and tumbling over the wounded and the\\ndead, I crept up the fore-ladder.  I looked over the coamings of the\\nhatchway; the decks were clear of smoke, for not a gun was being fired.\\nMerciful Heaven! what a scene of slaughter!  Many of the guns were\\ndismantled, and the decks were strewed with the splinters and plankings\\nof the gunwale, broken spars, and negroes lying dead, or drunk, in all\\ndirections--some cut and torn to pieces, others whole, but mixed up with\\nthe fragments of other bodies: such a scene of blood I have never since\\nwitnessed.  Out of the whole crew, I do not think there were twenty men\\nleft unhurt, and these were leaning or lying down, exhausted with\\nfatigue or overcome with liquor, on various parts of the deck.\\n\\nThe fighting was over; there was not one man at his gun--and of those\\nwho remained still alive, one or two fell, while I was looking up from\\nthe shot, which continued every minute to pierce the bulwarks.  Where\\nwas Vincent?  I dare not go aft to see.  I dare not venture to meet his\\neye.  I dived down below again, and I returned aft to the cabin; there\\nwas no more demand for powder; not a soul was to be seen abaft.\\nSuddenly the after-hatchway grating was thrown off; I heard some one\\ndescend; I knew it was the hurried tread of the negro captain.  It was\\nso dark, and the cabin so full of smoke, that, coming from the light, he\\ndid not perceive me, although I could distinguish him.  He was evidently\\nbadly wounded, and tottered in his walk: he came into the cabin, put his\\nhand to his girdle, and felt for his pistol, and then he commenced\\npulling down the screen, which was between him and the magazine.  His\\nintentions were evident; which were to blow up the vessel.\\n\\nI felt that I had not a moment to lose.  I dashed past him, ran up the\\nladder, sprung aft to the taffrail, and dashed over the stern into the\\nsea.  I was still beneath the surface, having not yet risen from my\\nplunge, when I heard and felt the explosion--felt it, indeed, so\\npowerfully, that it almost took away my senses; so great was the shock,\\neven when I was under the water, that I was almost insensible.  I have a\\nfaint recollection of being drawn down by the vortex of the sinking\\nvessel, and scrambling my way to the surface of the water, amidst\\nfragments of timbers and whirling bodies.  When I recovered myself, I\\nfound that I was clinging to a portion of the wreck, in a sort of patch,\\nas it were, upon the deep blue water, dark as ink, and strewed with\\nsplintered fragments.\\n\\nThere I remained some minutes, during which time I gained my\\nrecollection: I looked around and perceived the Arrow schooner, lying\\nabout one hundred yards off, totally dismantled, and my own frigate\\nabout a quarter of a mile to leeward, as bright and as fresh as if she\\nhad just been refitted.  I observed a signal, made by the Calliope to\\nthe schooner, which was answered.  I looked in vain towards the\\nschooner, expecting her to lower down a boat.  The fact was, that the\\nCalliope had made the signal for her to do so, and the schooner had\\nreplied that she had no boat that could swim.  I then perceived that the\\nfrigate had lowered down a boat which was pulling towards me, and I\\nconsidered myself as safe.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, during which I had quite recovered myself, the boat\\npulled into the mass of floating fragments, and then the sailors ceased\\nrowing to look about them.  They perceived and pulled towards me--\\nhoisted me in over the gunwale, and laid me at the bottom of the boat.\\nI scrambled on my feet, and would have gone _aft_, when the midshipman\\nof the boat said to the men, \"Pass that cursed young pirate forward--\\ndon\\'t let him come aft here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, Mr Lascelles,\" thinks I--\"so you don\\'t know me; you shall know\\nme by-and-by.\"  I quite forgot that I was stained black, till one of the\\nmen who seized me by the collar to pass me forward, said, \"Hand along\\nthe nigger.  He\\'s a young one for the gallows, any how.\"\\n\\nThey handed me forward, and I did not choose to say who I was.  My love\\nof fun returned the moment that I was again with my shipmates.  After\\nlooking well round and ascertaining that I was the only one left alive,\\nthey pulled back to the frigate; and the midshipman went up to report.\\nI was handed up the side and remained at the break of the gangway, while\\nthe captain and first lieutenant were talking with Mr Lascelles: during\\nwhich Mr Tommy Dott came up to me, and, putting his finger to his left\\near, gave a cluck with his tongue, as much as to say, \"You\\'ll be hanged,\\nmy good fellow.\"\\n\\nI could not help giving the first mason\\'s sign which I taught to Mr\\nGreen in return for Tommy\\'s communication; to wit, putting my thumb to\\nmy nose, and extending my finger out towards him; at which Tommy Dott\\nexpressed much indignation, and called me a precious impudent varmin.\\nThe men who were near us laughed, and said that I was game at all\\nevents.  No one knew me; for not only was my face well stained, but I\\nwas covered from head to foot with a solution of salt water and\\ngunpowder, which made me still more indistinguishable.\\n\\nI had remained at the gangway about two minutes, when the first\\nlieutenant said, \"Bring the prisoner here.\"\\n\\nI immediately went aft; and as soon as I was standing before Captain\\nDelmar and the first lieutenant--(and behind were all the officers,\\nanxious to hear what I had to disclose)--I put my hand to my head,\\nhaving no hat, as may be supposed, and said, \"_Come on board, sir_,\"\\nreporting myself, as is usually the custom of officers when they return\\nfrom leave or duty.\\n\\n\"Good Heavens! that voice!--why, who are you?\" cried Captain Delmar,\\nstarting back a pace.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, sir,\" replied I, again putting my hand to my head.\\n\\nBob Cross, who was, with many of the seamen, close to me, quite\\nforgetting etiquette, ran up and caught me round the waist, looking me\\nfull in the face: \"It is him, sir--it is him!  Huzzah! huzzah!\" and all\\nthe seamen joined in the huzzahs, which were, however, mingled with a\\ngreat deal of laughter.\\n\\n\"Merciful Heaven! and so you have been blown up in that vessel,\" said\\nthe first lieutenant, coming to me, with great kindness.  \"Are you much\\nburnt?  Why, he\\'s quite black--where\\'s the surgeon?\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t hurt at all, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Let him be taken down and examined,\" said the captain with some\\nemotion; \"if not hurt, let him come into the cabin to me.\"\\n\\nThe captain went down the ladder, and then I shook hands with Tommy Dott\\nand all the other officers and midshipmen; and I will say that my\\nre-appearance appeared to give unusual satisfaction.  I went down into\\nthe gun-room and was stripped.  They were much surprised to find that I\\nwas not hurt, and even more when they discovered that I was black all\\nover, and that washing would not restore my colour.\\n\\n\"Why, Keene,\" said the first lieutenant, \"how is it that you have\\nchanged your colour?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sir, I\\'ve been playing the nigger for these last three months.  It\\nis a long story, but I will go with you to the captain, and I will tell\\nit there.\"\\n\\nAs soon as I had put on my uniform, I went up with Mr Hippesley to the\\ncabin, and having, at the captain\\'s request, taken a chair, I entered\\ninto a full explanation, which lasted more than an hour.\\n\\nAs soon as I had finished, Mr Hippesley who had plenty to do on deck,\\nbut who could not leave until he had heard my story, quitted the cabin,\\nand I found myself alone with the captain.\\n\\n\"I must say that I gave you up for lost,\" said Captain Delmar; \"the\\nboat\\'s crew were picked up the next morning, and reported that you were\\ndrowned in the cabin of the vessel.  Scoundrels, to desert you in that\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think they were to blame, sir; the water being so high in the\\ncabin, and my not answering to their call.\"\\n\\n\"But did they call you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; I heard them call when I was half asleep, and I did not\\nanswer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am glad to hear you say so; but so convinced have we been of\\nyour loss, that I have written to your mother on the subject.  Strange,\\nthis is the second time that she has been distressed in this way.  You\\nappear to have a charmed life, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I shall long live to do credit to your protection, sir,\" replied\\nI.\\n\\n\"I hope so too, Mr Keene,\" replied the captain, very kindly; \"I\\nsincerely hope so too.  In all this business you have conducted yourself\\nvery manfully.  It does you great credit, and your mother ought to be\\nproud of you.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I, for I was overjoyed at such language from\\nCaptain Delmar, and I thought to myself, if he says my mother ought be\\nproud of me, he feels so himself.\\n\\n\"Of course, you cannot do duty under such a masquerade as you are at\\npresent,\" continued the captain, who referred to my stained skin.  \"I\\npresume it will wear off by-and-by.  You will dine with me to-day; now\\nyou may go to your messmates.\"\\n\\nI left the cabin, bowing very respectfully, and pleased with what had\\noccurred.  I hastened to join my messmates, not, however, until I had\\nshaken hands with Bob Cross, who appeared as delighted to see me as if\\nhe was my father.\\n\\nI leave the reader to imagine the sort of levee which I held both on the\\nquarter-deck and below.  Mr Hippesley could not get any of the officers\\nto mind their duty.  I certainly was for two or three days the greatest\\npersonage in the ship.  After that, I had time to tell the whole of my\\nhistory quietly to Bob Cross.\\n\\nBob Cross, when he had heard me without interruption, said, \"Well,\\nMaster Keene, there\\'s no telling what a man\\'s born to till after he\\'s\\ndead, and then it\\'s all known: but it does appear to me that you are\\nborn to something out of the common.  Here you are, not sixteen, not\\nonly playing a man\\'s part, but playing it manfully.  You have been put\\nin most difficult situations, and always have fallen upon your feet in\\nthe end.  You appear to have an old head upon very young shoulders; at\\none moment to be a scampish boy full of mischief, and at another a\\nresolute, cool, and clever man.  Sarcumstances, they say, make men, and\\nso it appears in you; but it does seem strange for one and the same lad\\nto be stealing the purser\\'s plums at one moment, and twisting a devil of\\na nigger pirate round his finger the very next; and then you have had\\nsuch escapes--twice reported dead at head-quarters, and twice come to\\nlife again.  Now Master Keene, I\\'ve very good news to tell you: you\\ndon\\'t know how high you stand with the captain and officers: there\\'s a\\nfeeling of envy against a lad who goes ahead (as well as a man) which\\nblinds people to his real merits; but when he is supposed to be dead and\\ngone, and no longer in the way of others, then every one tells the real\\ntruth; and I do assure you that not only the officers, but the captain\\nhimself, grieved most sorely at your loss.  I saw the captain\\'s eyes\\nwink more than once when speaking of you, and the first lieutenant was\\nalways telling the other mids that he had not one worth his salt, now\\nthat you were gone.  And now that you have come back and gained so much\\ncredit for what has passed, I do really think that the captain is proud\\nof you.  I overheard a little conversation between the captain and first\\nlieutenant the day you came on board, after you had been in the cabin\\ntelling your adventures, and all that I can say is, that the game is in\\nyour own hands, if you only play your cards well, and never let Captain\\nDelmar have the least idea that you know that you have such claims upon\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"That I certainly will not,\" replied I, \"as it might check his feeling\\ntowards me.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly: I\\'ve often thought about you, and now that I like you so much,\\nI watch the captain for your sake, and listen particularly to what he\\nsays after dinner especially, when I\\'ve the opportunity; for you see,\\nwhen gentlemen drink wine, they speak more freely as to what they really\\nthink, just as we foremast-men do when we get our grog on board.  The\\ngreatest misfortune which could happen to you in your position would be,\\nthe captain marrying and having children on the right side of the\\nblanket as they call it.  Now I\\'ve often heard the captain express a\\ndislike to matrimony, and laugh at people\\'s getting married, which has\\npleased me very much for your sake, Master Percival.  You see, a man\\ndon\\'t think much of marrying after forty, and the captain must be fifty,\\nif not more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes: but if his brother dies--and he is a very infirm man--the captain\\nwill then be Viscount de Versely, and inherit very large estates, and\\nthen he will marry to have an heir to the title and estates even if\\nthere is no love in the case.\"\\n\\n\"So he may,\" replied Cross--\"there\\'s no saying; but still, even if he\\ndoes, it ain\\'t certain that he has a family; chickens must not be\\ncounted before they are hatched.  All you have to pray for then is, that\\nthe brother may prove as tough as our old admirals, whose senses get\\ntired of staying any longer in their bodies, and leave them long before\\ntheir hulks are worn out.\"\\n\\n\"Why do admirals live so long?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it is for the same reason that salt meat keeps so much\\nlonger than fresh; they have been forty or fifty years with the salt\\nspray washing in their faces and wetting their jackets, and so in time,\\nd\\'ye see, they become as it were pickled with brine.  Talking about\\nthat, how long will it be before you get that tanning off you?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; but as the captain says I\\'m to do no duty while it lasts,\\nI hope it won\\'t wear off too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Spoken like a midshipman: now take my advice, although not ordered to\\nyour duty, come up on deck and take your spy-glass.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve lost it, unfortunately.  That was a good glass, for it saved my\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it turned out as good for you as a Freemason\\'s sign, which is more\\nthan Mr Green can say.  I don\\'t think he\\'ll ever make a sailor--he\\'d\\nbetter bear up for clerk, and then he might do very well for a purser\\nby-and-by.  There\\'s eight bells, Master Keene, so I think we had better\\nsay good night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\\n\\nThe Arrow schooner had suffered very severely in the contest, having\\nlost her commanding officer and thirteen men killed and wounded: indeed,\\nhad not the Calliope been at hand, it was the general opinion that the\\nStella would have overpowered her, notwithstanding that the latter had\\nlost her mainmast, for the Arrow was completely dismantled, and would\\nnot have been able to have made sail.\\n\\nThe Calliope sent her carpenters and best seamen on board to repair her\\ndamages, and the next day we stood away for Port Royal, Jamaica, to\\nannounce the destruction of the pirate vessel.\\n\\nIn the morning Captain Delmar sent for me.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, as you cannot do duty for the present, and as I do not wish\\nyou to be idle, I think you had better pay a little attention to\\nnavigation.  You send in your day\\'s work, I perceive, but I suppose you\\nhave never regularly gone through a course of study.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I fudge my day\\'s work, and I should be very glad\\nto learn navigation properly.\"\\n\\n\"So I presume.  Well, then, I have spoken with Mr Smith, the master,\\nwho has promised me to give you the necessary instruction.  You will\\ncommence to-morrow; you can sit at the table in the fore-cabin, where\\nyou will have nothing to distract your attention.  You may go now.\"\\n\\nI bowed and left the cabin, and meeting Bob Cross on the main deck, I\\ntold him what the captain had said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it, Master Keene; it shows that the captain does now take a\\nstrong interest in you.  He has never taken any trouble of that kind\\nwith any midshipman before.  It will be of great service to you, so pay\\nattention; it will please the captain if the master gives a good report\\nof you.  Who knows but you may be sent away in a prize, and I sent with\\nyou to take care of you?  Wouldn\\'t that be a capital spree?\"\\n\\nThe next day I commenced accordingly, under the tuition of the master,\\nand as I had not Tommy Dott to play with, I gave satisfaction, and\\ncontinued to do so until our arrival at Port Royal, when the captain\\nwent up to the admiral\\'s, stating all the particulars of the action,\\nand, by way of sequel, my adventures on board of the pirate vessel.  The\\nadmiral was so much interested that he requested Captain Delmar to bring\\nme on shore to dine with me the next day.\\n\\nI was still very black; but that made me, I presume more interesting.  I\\ntold my story over again, and it afforded great amusement to the\\ncompany; particularly to the ladies; and I have reason to believe that\\nmany compliments were paid me behind my back, by the admiral and\\nofficers who dined there; at all events, Captain Delmar was much\\npleased.\\n\\nMy strange history soon got wind.  The governor heard of it, and asked\\nCaptain Delmar about it.  The consequence was, that I received another\\ninvitation from the governor, and Captain Delmar again informed me that\\nI might tell my own story, which I did, modestly as before.  I say\\nmodestly, for I never was a boaster at any time; and I really believe\\nthat I thought much less of the circumstances than those did to whom I\\nnarrated them.  I had at that time but one wish, which was to find\\nfavour in the sight of Captain Delmar.  I felt that all my prospects in\\nlife depended upon that; and aware of his disposition, and the deference\\nthat he expected, humility had become, as it were, habitual.\\n\\nDuring the time that we remained at Port Royal I continued my studies in\\nthe cabin and as the captain remained almost altogether on shore, I\\nfound the run of the cabin very pleasant; but as I had no inclination to\\nstudy the whole of the day, I was not sorry that Tommy Dott was very\\noften my companion in the cabin, an entrance to which, as he could not\\npass the sentry at the door, he obtained by climbing down the mizen\\nchains, and creeping into the port windows.  As soon as the captain\\'s\\nboat was seen coming off Tommy was out again by the port as quick as a\\nmonkey, and I was very studiously poring over right-angled triangles.  I\\nrose, of course, as the captain entered the cabin.  \"Sit down, Mr\\nKeene,\" he would say--\"sit down; the master has reported favourably of\\nyou, and I am glad to hear of it.\"\\n\\nOne morning, when, as usual, Tommy Dott had come through the port, we\\nwere so busily employed with a caricature which we were making of old\\nCulpepper, that the captain\\'s boat came alongside without our being\\naware of it, and the captain\\'s voice speaking to the first lieutenant as\\nhe was descending the after-ladder was the first intimation we received\\nof his being on board.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Tommy Dott to escape without being seen as he\\nclimbed out.  The table which was in the centre of the cabin was covered\\nwith a blue cloth, large enough for the table when all the additional\\nleaves were put to it, and in its present reduced size the cloth fell\\ndown to the deck; I pointed it out to Tommy, as the sentry\\'s hand upon\\nthe handle of the door announced the immediate entrance of the captain,\\nand he darted underneath the table, that he might escape detection\\nintending as soon as the captain went into the after-cabin to make his\\nretreat by the cabin-door or windows.  The captain entered, and I rose,\\nas usual, from my chair.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I have occasion to speak to the first lieutenant\\non important private business; oblige me by leaving the cabin till that\\nis done.  You may as well tell Mr Hippesley that I wish to see him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I making a bow, and leaving the cabin.  I felt very\\nmuch alarmed lest Tommy should be discovered in his hiding-place; and\\nafter the captain had stated that he had particular business with the\\nfirst lieutenant, it was my duty, knowing that Mr Dott was there, to\\nhave said so.  I hardly knew what to do, or how to act.  After all, it\\nwas no great crime as it stood.  Tommy Dott had come into the cabin\\nwithout leave, and had concealed himself; but if I was to allow Tommy to\\nremain there and listen to important and particular business, evidently\\nof a secret nature, I should forfeit the good opinion and confidence of\\nthe captain: nevertheless, I was very unwilling to betray him; I was\\ndreadfully puzzled, and when I went to the first lieutenant he perceived\\nmy confusion.\\n\\n\"Why, what is the matter with you, Mr Keene?--you look quite\\nfrightened,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I am,\" replied I; \"and I think it my duty to tell you why I\\nam so.\"\\n\\nI then informed him that Tommy Dott was under the cabin-table, and\\nwould, of course, hear the secret communications of the captain.\\n\\n\"You have done very right, Mr Keene, and I know how unpleasant it is to\\nyou to inform against your messmate; but at present there is no harm\\ndone.\"\\n\\nHe then laughed, and said, \"However, Mr Dott shall never know that you\\nhave said anything about it, and I will frighten him out of the cabin\\nfor the future.\"\\n\\nHe then went down the ladder, and into the fore-cabin.  I expected that\\nhe would have discovered Tommy as if by accident, but such was not the\\ncase.  The captain had just gone into the after-cabin, and Mr Hippesley\\nimmediately followed him, and shutting the door, informed him of Mr\\nDott\\'s position, and why I had made it known.  The captain could not\\nhelp laughing, as, after all, it was no great offence.\\n\\nHe then gave the necessary information to the first lieutenant, and they\\nboth walked into the fore-cabin; the first lieutenant saying, \"If you\\nplease, then, Captain Delmar, I will send a boat immediately with the\\nletter.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied the captain, sitting down, and who evidently was\\ninclined to join in the joke with Mr Hippesley.  \"Sentry, send the\\nofficer on deck to man the jolly-boat, and tell Mr Dott to come here\\nimmediately.\"\\n\\nI was on deck when the sentry put his head up the ladder and gave the\\norder, and I immediately perceived the plan of the first lieutenant and\\nthe state of alarm in which Tommy Dott must have been put.\\n\\nThe jolly-boat was manned, and Mr Dott called for in every quarter of\\nthe ship, but he did not make his appearance.  After a delay of several\\nminutes, the officer on deck went down into the cabin, reporting that\\nthe jolly-boat had been manned some time but that Mr Dott was not to be\\nfound.\\n\\n\"Not to be found!\" replied the captain; \"why, he can\\'t have fallen\\noverboard.\"\\n\\n\"Not he, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant; \"he has gone to sleep\\nsomewhere: either in the tops or the fore-topmast staysail netting.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be a very troublesome boy,\" replied the captain.\\n\\n\"Very useless, indeed, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"Sentry,\\nhave they found Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; quarter-masters have been everywhere.  He\\'s not in the ship.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd!\" observed the captain.\\n\\n\"Oh! he\\'ll turn up soon, sir; but really, Captain Delmar, if you were to\\ngive him two or three dozen at the cabin gun, it would bring him to his\\nsenses.\"\\n\\n\"That I most certainly will do,\" replied Captain Delmar; \"and I\\nauthorise you to do it, Mr Hippesley, as soon as he makes his\\nappearance; it will be of some service to him; but I hope no accident\\nhas happened to him.\"\\n\\n\"I have no fear of that, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant: \"if the\\npurser\\'s steward\\'s room had been open to-day, I should have sent to see\\nif he was not locked up in another attempt to steal raisins, but that\\nhas not been the case.  By-the-by, the spirit-room was open this\\nmorning, and he may have been down there, and may have had the hatches\\nput over him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must send another midshipman; call Mr Keene,\" said Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nThe sentry called me, and I made my appearance.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you\\'ll go on shore to the dockyard in the jolly-boat: give\\nthat letter to the master attendant, and wait for an answer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Have you seen anything of Mr Dott?\" said the first lieutenant; \"you\\nare constantly together.\"\\n\\n\"I saw him just before Captain Delmar came on board, sir, but I have not\\nseen him since.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, we will settle accounts with the young gentleman as soon as\\nhe turns up,\" replied the captain: \"you may go, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\nI perceived that the captain and first lieutenant both smiled as I left\\nthe cabin.  It appeared that soon after they left it and the captain\\nwent on shore; but Tommy was so frightened that he remained in his\\nhiding-place, as he made sure he would be flogged if he made his\\nappearance, and he resolved to remain where he was until my return, that\\nhe might consult me.\\n\\nAs soon as I had reported myself, and given the answer to the first\\nlieutenant, I hastened to the cabin, and then poor Tommy crawled from\\nunder the table; the tears were still wet on his cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall be flogged, Keene, as sure as I stand here.  Tell me, what can\\nI do--what can I say?\"\\n\\n\"Tell the truth; that\\'s the best way,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Tell the captain that I was hid under the table! that would never do.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, it\\'s the best plan,\" replied I; \"and it is the only\\nadvice I can give you: you may be flogged if you tell the truth, but you\\nare _sure_ to be flogged if you tell a lie.  It will only add to your\\noffence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been thinking about it--I\\'m sure that Mr Hippesley will\\nflog me if he catches me to-day or to-morrow; but if I remain hid for a\\nday or two, they will really think that I have fallen overboard, and\\nthen they will say, `poor Tommy Dott,\\' and perhaps be so glad when I do\\nmake my appearance, that they will forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I, delighted at the idea; \"I\\'m sure they will, if you do\\ntell the truth when you appear again.\"\\n\\n\"Then, that is what I\\'ll do.  The first lieutenant said that I might be\\nin the spirit-room.  Where shall I go to?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said I, \"you must remain under the table till dark, and then you\\nmay easily slip down into the coal-hole, where it is so dark that they\\nnever will see you, even if they go down for coals.  It is the only\\nplace I know of; stay there all to-morrow and next day, and come up in\\nthe evening; or the next morning perhaps will be better.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a very good place,\" replied Tommy; \"anything better than\\nbeing flogged; but will you bring me something to eat and drink?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me, Tommy,\" replied I; \"I\\'ll contrive to bring you\\nsomething every night.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll do that,\" replied he.\\n\\n\"Yes; and tell the truth when you come out,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my honour I will;\" and so saying, Tommy, hearing a noise,\\nagain dived under the cabin table.\\n\\nSoon afterwards I went out of the cabin.  The first lieutenant beckoned\\nme to him, and asked me where Mr Dott was, and I told him what had been\\narranged between us.  He laughed very much, and said--\\n\\n\"Well, if Master Tommy punishes himself by two days\\' confinement in the\\ncoal-hole, and tells the truth when he comes out, I think I may promise\\nhe will get off his flogging; but don\\'t you say that I have spoken to\\nyou about it, and let him do as he proposes.\"\\n\\nWhen it was dark, I supplied Tommy with provisions, and he gained the\\ncoal-hole without being discovered.\\n\\nThe next day the speculations at his disappearance were general, and it\\nwas now believed that poor Tommy had fallen overboard, and, as the\\nsharks are thick enough in Port Royal, that he was safely stowed away in\\none of their maws.  I will say that the whole of the ship\\'s company were\\nvery sorry for him, with the exception of Mr Culpepper, who observed\\nthat no good ever came of a boy who stole raisins.\\n\\n\"So you think, that because a lad steals a few of your confounded\\nplums,\" observed the second lieutenant, \"he deserves to be eaten by the\\nsharks.  If I were Tommy Dott, I would haunt you if I could.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of dead men,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"they are quiet\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps so; but recollect, you make them chew tobacco, and therefore\\nthey ought to rise up in judgment against you, if they do against any\\none.\"\\n\\nAs this conversation passed on the quarter-deck, it put an idea in my\\nhead.  That night I went to Tommy, whom I found terribly tired of\\nsitting on the coals.  I brought him a bottle of mixed grog, and some\\nboiled beef and biscuit.  I consoled him by telling him that every one\\nwas sorry at his disappearance, and that I was convinced that he would\\nnot be punished if he told the truth.\\n\\nTommy was for leaving the coal-hole immediately, but I pointed out to\\nhim that the captain had not been on board that a and that it was\\nnecessary that the captain should believe that he had fallen overboard\\nas well as the officers, or his compassion would not be roused.  Tommy\\nsaw the propriety of this, and consented to remain another day.  I then\\ntold him what Mr Culpepper had said, and I added, \"Now, Tommy, if Mr\\nCulpepper should see you by any chance, pretend to be your ghost.\"\\n\\n\"That I will,\" replied Tommy, \"if I get six dozen for it.\"  I then left\\nhim.\\n\\nOn my return on deck, I saw Bob Cross; he was on shore during the major\\nportion of the day, attending upon the captain, and as I was no longer\\nin the captain\\'s gig, I saw but little of him.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I think you have quite recovered your\\ncolour by this time, and I hope to see you in the gig again.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think I shall yet awhile--I have not yet learnt navigation\\nenough; but the master says he will be done with me in a fortnight, if I\\ngo on as well as I do now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I heard him tell the captain that you were very quick, and would\\nbe a good navigator but I can\\'t get over the loss of poor Tommy Dott; he\\nwas a little scampish, that\\'s sartin, but still he was a merry,\\nkind-hearted boy--too good for the sharks, at all events.  You must feel\\nhis loss, Mr Keene, for you were always together.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t, Bob,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m sorry to hear you say that, Mr Keene; I thought you had a\\nkinder heart.\"\\n\\n\"So I have, Bob; but I\\'ll tell you a secret, known only to the first\\nlieutenant and me; and that is, Tommy\\'s in the coal-hole, very dirty,\\nbut quite safe.\"\\n\\nBob Cross burst into a fit of laughing, which lasted some time.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, you have really taken a weight off my mind; now tell\\nme all about it.  You know I\\'m safe.\"\\n\\nI then told Bob what had happened, and of Tommy\\'s intention to make his\\nappearance on the following evening or the next morning.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"you\\'re mischief itself, Master Keene, and that\\'s a\\nfact; however, it\\'s all right this time, and you have the captain and\\nfirst lieutenant as your confidants and partners in the joke.  You did\\nperfectly right and I\\'m sure the captain and first lieutenant must be\\npleased with you; but recollect, Master Keene, keep your distance as\\nbefore; don\\'t presume.\"\\n\\n\"Never fear, Bob,\" replied I: \"but now I have told you that, I want you\\nto assist me.\"  I then repeated the conversation of Mr Culpepper with\\nthe second lieutenant.\\n\\n\"Now,\" continued I; \"you see, Cross, I can\\'t do anything myself; Mr\\nCulpepper hates me, and would suspect me; but if we could only frighten\\nhim: you might, for he would not think you were playing him a trick.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" replied Bob; \"it will be a good thing for Tommy Dott, and a\\nnice wind-up of this affair.  Let me alone.  When I come on board\\nto-morrow evening I\\'ll manage it if I can.\"\\n\\nAfter a little more conversation, we separated for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning the captain came on board.  He remained on deck with\\nthe first lieutenant for some minutes, during which of course, he was\\nmade acquainted with Tommy Dott\\'s position.  When he came down into the\\ncabin, I moved from my seat, as respectful and serious as before; and\\nwhen ordered to sit down again, resumed my studies with great apparent\\ndiligence.  He did not say a word to me about Tommy Dott; and as he was\\ngoing out of the cabin, Mr Culpepper was announced by the sentry.\\n\\n\"If you please, Captain Delmar,\" said Mr Culpepper, with his usual\\nprofound bow, \"what are we to do with the effects of Mr Dott, who has\\nfallen overboard?  By the regulations of the service, they should be\\nsold before the mast.  And I also wish to know whether he is to be\\ncontinued to be victualled, or whether it is your pleasure that he is\\ndischarged as dead?\"\\n\\nThe captain smiled, and turned his face towards me; but I continued with\\nmy eyes down on my book.\\n\\n\"Perhaps we had better wait till to-morrow, Mr Culpepper,\" replied the\\ncaptain, \"and then you may sell his effects, and put DD to his name,\\npoor fellow.\"  And having made this reply, the captain went out of his\\ncabin.  Mr Culpepper followed; and shortly afterwards the captain went\\non shore again.\\n\\nBefore dusk, the captain\\'s gig, as usual, returned on board, and I was\\nat the gangway to meet Bob Cross; the boat was hoisted up, and then Bob\\ncame to me.\\n\\n\"I must first go down and see Mr Dott, that I may be able to swear to\\nthe fact.\"  Bob did so, and then returned on deck.  Mr Culpepper was\\nabaft, walking by himself, when Bob went up and accosted him.\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Bob, touching his hat, \"did the captain say\\nanything to you about coals, for I expect we shall not \\n[end of the book]\\n\\nNow you have read it. Please summarize it for me. First, tell me the title and the author, and then tell the story in 500 words.]\\n\\n ASSISTANT:'"
