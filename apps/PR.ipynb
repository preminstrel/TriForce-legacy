It is a handsome building, surrounded by a\\nfinely timbered park of some extent, and, what is more important, by\\nabout 12,000 acres of land, which also appertain to it.  At the period\\nin which I commence this history, there resided in this mansion an\\nelderly spinster of rank, named the Honourable Miss Delmar, sister of\\nthe late Lord de Versely and aunt to the present earl, and an Honourable\\nCaptain Delmar, who was the second son of the deceased nobleman.  This\\nproperty belonged to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was at her entire\\ndisposal upon her decease.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar, at the time I am speaking of, commanded a\\nfrigate employed upon what was designated channel service, which in\\nthose days implied that the captain held a seat in the House of Commons\\nand that he voted with the ministry; and further, that his vote might,\\nwhen required, be forthcoming, the frigate was never sea-going, except\\nduring the recess.  It must be admitted that H.M. ship Paragon did\\noccasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for\\ntwo or three days, until the steward reported that the milk provided for\\nthe captain\\'s table was turning sour; upon which important information\\nthe helm was immediately put up, and the frigate, in a case of such\\nextreme distress, would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her\\nlee.  Now as the Paragon was constantly at Spithead, Captain Delmar was\\nvery attentive in visiting his aunt, who lived at Madeline Hall;\\nill-natured people asserted, because she had so fine an estate in her\\nown gift.  Certain it is, that he would remain there for weeks, which\\ngave great satisfaction to the old lady, who liked her nephew, liked\\nattention, and was even so peculiar as to like sailors.  But it must be\\nobserved that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the\\ncaptain, liked attention, and liked sailors; this was Miss Arabella\\nMason, a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age, who\\nconstantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seen\\na face which she preferred to her own, and who never read any novel\\nwithout discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the\\nheroine and her pretty self.\\n\\nMiss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old\\nLord de Versely, brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar, and was much\\nrespected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of\\nbusiness, in the transaction of which he fell, for he was felling trees,\\nand a tree fell upon him.  He left a widow and two daughters: it was\\nsaid that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off, as her husband had\\nbeen very careful of his earnings.  Mrs Mason, however, did not\\ncorroborate this statement; on the contrary, she invariably pleaded\\npoverty; and the Honourable Miss Delmar, after Lord de Versely\\'s death--\\nwhich happened soon after that of his steward--sent both the daughters\\nto be educated at a country school, where, as everything that is taught\\nis second-rate, young ladies, of course, receive a second-rate\\neducation.  Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar\\nto spend a month at Madeline Hall, and used to bring her eldest\\ndaughter, who had left school, with her.  Latterly, however, the\\ndaughter remained as a fixture, and Mrs Mason received but an\\noccasional invitation.  It may be inquired in what capacity Miss\\nArabella Mason remained at the Hall; she was not a servant, for her\\nposition in life was above that of a menial; neither was she received\\naltogether in the saloon, as she was of too humble a grade to mix with\\ngentry and nobility; she was, therefore, betwixt and between, a sort of\\nhumble companion in the drawing-room, a cut above the housekeeper in the\\nstill-room, a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinster\\'s wishes, a\\nsort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants,\\ntowards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion.  However this\\nposition might be found useful to her mistress, it must be admitted that\\nit was a most unfortunate position for a young, thoughtless, and very\\npretty girl, moreover, who was naturally very lively, very smart in\\nrepartee, and very fond of being admired.\\n\\nAs the Honourable Captain Delmar was very constant in his visits to his\\naunt, it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her\\nhumble companion.  By degrees the intimacy increased, and at last there\\nwere reports in the servants\\' hall, that the captain and Miss Bella\\nMason had been seen together in the evergreen walk; and as the captain\\'s\\nvisits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did\\nthe scandal increase, and people became more ill-natured.  It was now\\nseen that Miss Bella had been very often found in tears, and the old\\nbutler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like\\nresponsive mandarins; the only person who was ignorant of the scandal\\nafloat was the old lady spinster herself.\\n\\nI must now introduce another personage.  The Honourable Captain Delmar\\ndid not, of course, travel without his valet, and this important\\npersonage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been\\ndrafted into the frigate.  Benjamin Keene, for such was his name, was\\ncertainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a\\nvalet; he was very clean in his person, very respectful in his\\ndeportment, and, after the sovereign of Great Britain, looked upon the\\nHonourable Captain Delmar as the greatest person in the world.\\nMoreover, Benjamin Keene, although only a private marine was, without\\nexception, one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being\\nequally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person, he\\nwas the admiration of all the young women.  But Nature, who delights in\\na drawback, had contrived to leave him almost without brains; and\\nfurther, he was wholly uneducated--for he was too stupid to learn--his\\nfaculties were just sufficient to enable him, by constant drilling, to\\nbe perfect in the manual exercise, and mechanically to perform his\\nduties as a valet.\\n\\nBen always accompanied his master to the hall, where the former was at\\none and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants.\\nIt hardly need be observed, that the clever and sprightly Miss Arabella\\nMason considered Ben as one much beneath her, that is, she said so on\\nhis first arrival at Madeline hall; but, strange to say, that two years\\nafterwards, just at the time that reports had been raised that she had\\nbeen frequently discovered in tears, there was a change in her manner\\ntowards him; indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap\\nat the handsome marine: this idea, it is true, was ridiculed by the\\nmajority; but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase.  It was\\nafterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken\\nplace, that Ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal\\nmatch had he not been prompted to it by his master, who actually\\nproposed that he should marry the girl.  That such was the fact is\\nundoubted, although they knew it not; and Ben, who considered the wish\\nof his captain as tantamount to an order, as soon as he could comprehend\\nwhat his captain required of him, stood up erect and raised his hand\\nwith a flourish to his head, in token of his obedience.  Shortly\\nafterwards, Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall, accompanied\\nas usual, by Ben, and the second day after their arrival it was made\\nknown to all whom it might concern, that Miss Arabella Mason had\\nactually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene.\\n\\nOf course, the last person made acquainted with this interesting\\nintelligence was the Honourable Miss Delmar, and her nephew took upon\\nhimself to make the communication.  At first the honourable spinster\\nbridled up with indignation, wondered at the girl\\'s indelicacy, and much\\nmore at her demeaning herself by marrying a private marine.  Captain\\nDelmar replied, that it was true that Ben was only a private, but that\\nevery common soldier was a gentleman by profession.  It was true that\\nBella Mason might have done better--but she was his aunt\\'s servant, and\\nKeene was his valet, so that the disparity was not so very great.  He\\nthen intimated that he had long perceived the growing attachment; talked\\nof the danger of young people being left so much together; hinted about\\nopportunity, and descanted upon morals and propriety.  The Honourable\\nMiss Delmar was softened down by the dexterous reasoning of her nephew;\\nshe was delighted to find so much virtue extant in a sailor; and, after\\nan hour\\'s conversation, the married couple were sent for, graciously\\npardoned, and Mrs Keene, after receiving a very tedious lecture,\\nreceived a very handsome present.  But if her mistress was appeased,\\nMrs Keene\\'s mother was not.  As soon as the intelligence was received,\\nold Mrs Mason set off for Madeline Hall.  She first had a closeted\\ninterview with her daughter, and then with Captain Delmar, and as soon\\nas the latter was over, she immediately took her departure, without\\npaying her respects to the mistress of the Hall, or exchanging one word\\nwith any of the servants; this conduct gave occasion to more\\ninnuendoes--some indeed ascribed her conduct to mortification at her\\ndaughter\\'s having made so imprudent a match, but others exchanged very\\nsignificant glances.\\n\\nThree weeks after the marriage, the Parliament having been prorogued,\\nthe admiral of the port considered that he was justified in ordering the\\nfrigate out on a cruise.  Ben Keene, of course accompanied his master,\\nand it was not until three months had passed away that the frigate\\nreturned into port.  As usual, the Honourable Captain Delmar, as soon as\\nhe had paid his respects to the admiral, set off to visit his aunt,\\naccompanied by his benedict marine.  On his arrival, he found that\\neverything appeared to be in great confusion; indeed an event was\\noccurring which had astonished the whole household; the butler made a\\nprofound bow to the captain; the footmen forgot their usual smirk when\\nhe alighted.  Captain Delmar was ushered in solemn silence into the\\ndrawing-room, and his aunt, who had notice of his arrival received him\\nwith a stiff, prim air of unwonted frigidity, with her arms crossed\\nbefore her on her white muslin apron.\\n\\n\"My dear aunt,\" said Captain Delmar, as she coldly took his proffered\\nhand, \"what is the matter?\"\\n\\n\"The matter is this, nephew,\" replied the old lady--\"that marriage of\\nyour marine and Bella Mason should have taken place six months sooner\\nthan it did.  This is a wicked world, nephew; and sailors, I\\'m afraid,\\nare--\"\\n\\n\"Marines, you should say, in this instance, my dear aunt,\" replied\\nCaptain Delmar, insinuatingly.  \"I must confess that neither sailors nor\\nmarines are quite so strict as they ought to be; however, Ben has\\nmarried her.  Come, my dear aunt, allow me to plead for them, although I\\nam very much distressed that such an event should take place in your\\nhouse.  I think,\" added he, after a pause, \"I shall give Mr Keene seven\\ndozen at the gangway, for his presumption, as soon as I return on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"That won\\'t mend the matter, nephew,\" replied Miss Delmar.  \"I\\'ll turn\\nher out of the house as soon as she can be moved.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll flog him as soon as I get him on board,\" rejoined the captain.\\n\"I will not have your feelings shocked, and your mind harassed in this\\nway, by any impropriety on the part of my followers--most infamous--\\nshameful--abominable--unpardonable,\" interjected the captain, walking\\nthe quarter-deck up and down the room.\\n\\nThe Honourable Miss Delmar continued to talk, and the honourable captain\\nto agree with her in all she said, for an hour at least.  When people\\nare allowed to give vent to their indignation without the smallest\\nopposition they soon talk it away; such was the case with the Honourable\\nMiss Delmar.  When it was first announced that Bella Keene was safely in\\nbed with a fine boy, the offended spinster turned away from the\\ncommunication with horror; when her own maid ventured to remark that it\\nwas a lovely baby, she was ordered to hold her tongue; she would not see\\nthe suffering mother, and the horrid marine was commanded to stay in the\\nkitchen, lest she should be contaminated by meeting him on the stairs;\\nbut every day softened down her indignation, and before a fortnight was\\nover the Honourable Miss Delmar had not only seen but admired the baby;\\nand at last decided upon paying a visit to the mother, who was now\\nsufficiently recovered to undergo a lecture of about two hours\\' length,\\nin which the honourable spinster commented upon her _in_decency,\\n_in_discretion, _in_considerateness, _in_correctness, _in_decorum,\\n_in_continence, and _in_delicacy; pointing out that her conduct was most\\ninexcusable, iniquitous, and most infamous.  The Honourable Miss Delmar\\nhaving had such a long innings then gave it up, because she was out of\\nbreath.  Bella, who waited patiently to make her response, and who was a\\nvery clever girl, then declared, with many tears, that she was aware\\nthat her conduct was _in_excusable, her faults had been _in_voluntary,\\nand her sorrow was _in_expressible; her _in_experience and her\\n_in_fatuation her only apology; that her _in_felicity at her mistress\\'s\\ndispleasure would _in_evitably increase her sufferings; assured her that\\nshe was not _in_corrigible, and that if her mistress would only indulge\\nher with forgiveness, as she hoped to _in_herit heaven she would never\\n_in_cur her anger by committing the same fault again.  Satisfied with\\nthis assurance, the Honourable Miss Delmar softened down, and not only\\nforgave, but actually took the child into her lap that Bella might read\\nthe Bible which she had presented her with.  Reader, the child who had\\nthis great honour conferred upon him, who actually laid in the\\nimmaculate lap, on the apron of immaculate snowy whiteness of the\\nimmaculate Honourable Miss Delmar, was no other person than the narrator\\nof this history--or, if you please it, the Hero of this Tale.\\n\\nThat my mother had so far smoothed things pretty well must be\\nacknowledged; but it was to be presumed that her husband might not be\\npleased at so unusual an occurrence, and already the sneers and\\ninnuendoes of the servants\\' hall were not wanting.  It appeared,\\nhowever, that an interview had taken place between Ben and Captain\\nDelmar shortly after my making my appearance: what occurred did not\\ntranspire, but this is certain that, upon the marine\\'s return to the\\nkitchen, one of the grooms, who ventured to banter him, received such a\\nsound thrashing from Ben that it put an end to all further joking.  As\\nBen had taken up the affair so seriously, it was presumed that if there\\nhad been anticipation of the hymeneal rites he was himself the party who\\nhad been hasty; and that now he was married, he was resolved to resent\\nany impertinent remarks upon his conduct.  At all events, the question\\nnow became one of less interest, as the scandal was of less importance;\\nand as Ben had made known his determination to resent any remarks upon\\nthe subject, not a word more was said, at all events when he was\\npresent.\\n\\nIn due time I was christened, and so completely was my mother\\nreinstalled in the good graces of her mistress, that as Captain Delmar\\nhad volunteered to stand my sponsor, the Honourable Miss Delmar gave the\\nnecessary female security; at the particular request of my mother, the\\ncaptain consented that I should bear his own Christian name, and I was\\nduly registered in the church books as Percival Keene.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO.\\n\\nThere is no security in this world.  A dissolution of Parliament took\\nplace, and on the following election the Honourable Captain Delmar\\'s\\nconstituents, not being exactly pleased at the total indifference which\\nhe had shown to their interests, took upon themselves to elect another\\nmember in his stead, who, as Captain Delmar had previously done,\\npromised everything, and in all probability would follow the honourable\\ncaptain\\'s example by performing nothing.  The loss of his election was\\nfollowed up by the loss of his ship, his majesty\\'s government not\\nconsidering it necessary that Captain Delmar (now that he had leisure to\\nattend to his professional duties) should retain his command.  The\\nfrigate, therefore, was paid off, and recommissioned by another captain\\nwho had friends in Parliament.\\n\\nAs Ben Keene belonged to the marine corps, he could not, of course,\\nremain as valet to Captain Delmar, but was ordered, with the rest of the\\ndetachment, to the barracks at Chatham; my mother, although she was\\ndetermined that she would not live at barracks, was not sorry to leave\\nthe Hall, where she could not fail to perceive that she was, from her\\nimprudent conduct, no longer treated with the respect or cordiality to\\nwhich she had been previously accustomed.  She was most anxious to quit\\na place in which her disgrace was so well known; and Captain Delmar\\nhaving given her his advice, which coincided with her own ideas, and\\nalso a very munificent present to enable her to set up housekeeping,\\ntook his departure from the Hall.  My mother returned to her room as the\\nwheels of his carriage rattled over the gravel of the drive, and many\\nwere the bitter tears which she shed over her unconscious boy.\\n\\nThe following day the Honourable Miss Delmar sent for her; as usual,\\ncommenced with a tedious lecture, which, as before, was wound up at\\nparting with a handsome present.  The day after my mother packed up her\\ntrunks, and with me in her arms set off to Chatham, where we arrived\\nsafely, and immediately went into furnished lodgings.  My mother was a\\nclever, active woman, and the presents which she had at different times\\nreceived amounted to a considerable sum of money, over which her husband\\nhad never ventured to assert any claim.\\n\\nIndeed, I must do Ben Keene the justice to say that he had the virtue of\\nhumility.  He felt that his wife was in every way his superior and that\\nit was only under peculiar circumstances that he could have aspired to\\nher.  He was, therefore, submissive to her in everything, consenting to\\nevery proposal that was made by her, and guided by her opinion.  When,\\ntherefore, on her arrival at Chatham, she pointed out how impossible it\\nwould be for one brought up as she had been to associate with the women\\nin the barracks, and that she considered it advisable that she should\\nset up some business by which she might gain a respectable livelihood,\\nBen, although he felt that this would be a virtual separation _a mensa\\net thoro_, named no objections.  Having thus obtained the consent of her\\nhusband, who considered her so much his superior as to be infallible, my\\nmother, after much cogitation, resolved that she would embark her\\ncapital in a circulating library and stationer\\'s shop; for she argued\\nthat selling paper, pens, and sealing-wax was a commerce which would\\nsecure to her customers of the better class.  Accordingly, she hired a\\nhouse close to the barracks, with a very good-sized shop below, painting\\nand papering it very smartly; there was much taste in all her\\narrangements, and although the expenses of the outlay and the first\\nyear\\'s rent had swallowed up a considerable portion of the money she had\\nlaid by, it soon proved that she had calculated well, and her shop\\nbecame a sort of lounge for the officers, who amused themselves with her\\nsmartness and vivacity, the more so as she had a talent for repartee,\\nwhich men like to find in a very pretty woman.\\n\\nIn a short time my mother became quite the rage, and it was a mystery\\nhow so pretty and elegant a person could have become the wife of a\\nprivate marine.  It was however, ascribed to her having been captivated\\nwith the very handsome person and figure of her husband, and having\\nyielded to her feelings in a moment of infatuation.  The ladies\\npatronised her circulating library; the officers and gentlemen purchased\\nher stationery.  My mother then added gloves, perfumery, canes, and\\nlastly cigars, to her previous assortment and before she had been a year\\nin business, found that she was making money very fast, and increasing\\nher customers every day.  My mother had a great deal of tact; with the\\nother sex she was full of merriment and fond of joking, consequently a\\ngreat favourite; towards her own sex her conduct was quite the reverse;\\nshe assumed a respectful, prudish air, blended with a familiarity which\\nwas never offensive; she was, therefore, equally popular with her own\\nsex, and prospered in every sense of the word.  Had her husband been the\\nleast inclined to have asserted his rights, the position which she had\\ngained was sufficient to her reducing him to a state of subjection.  She\\nhad raised herself, unaided, far above him; he saw her continually\\nchatting and laughing with his own officers, to whom he was compelled to\\nmake a respectful salute whenever they passed by him; he could not\\nventure to address her, or even to come into the shop, when his officers\\nwere there, or it would have been considered disrespectful towards them;\\nand as he could not sleep out of barracks, all his intercourse with her\\nwas to occasionally slink down by the area, to find something better to\\neat than he could have in his own mess, or obtain from her an occasional\\nshilling to spend in beer.  Ben, the marine, found at last that somehow\\nor another, his wife had slipped out of his hands; that he was nothing\\nmore than a pensioner on her bounty a slave to her wishes, and a fetcher\\nand carrier at her command, and he resigned himself quietly to his fate,\\nas better men have done before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE.\\n\\nI think that the reader will agree with me that my mother showed in her\\nconduct great strength of character.  She had been compelled to marry a\\nman whom she despised, and to whom she felt herself superior in every\\nrespect; she had done so to save her reputation.  That she had been in\\nerror is true but situation and opportunity had conspired against her;\\nand when she found out the pride and selfishness of the man to whom she\\nwas devoted, and for whom she had sacrificed so much,--when her ears\\nwere wounded by proposals from his lips that she should take such a step\\nto avoid the scandal arising from their intimacy--when at the moment\\nthat he made such a proposition, and the veil fell down and revealed the\\nheart of man in its selfishness, it is not to be wondered that, with\\nbitter tears, arising from wounded love, anger, and despair at her\\nhopeless position, she consented.  After having lost all she valued,\\nwhat did she care for the future?  It was but one sacrifice more to\\nmake, one more proof of her devotion and obedience.  But there are few\\nwomen who, like my mother, would have recovered her position to the\\nextent that she did.  Had she not shown such determination, had she\\nconsented to have accompanied her husband to the barracks, and have\\nmixed up with the other wives of the men, she would have gradually sunk\\ndown to their level; to this she could not consent.  Having once freed\\nherself from her thraldom, he immediately sunk down to his level, as she\\nrose up to a position in which, if she could not ensure more than\\ncivility and protection, she was at all events secure from insult and\\nill-treatment.\\n\\nSuch was the state of affairs when I had arrived at the important age of\\nsix years, a comic-looking, laughing urchin, petted by the officers, and\\nas fall of mischief as a tree full of monkeys.  My mother\\'s business had\\nso much increased, that, about a year previous to this date, she had\\nfound it necessary to have some one to assist her, and had decided upon\\nsending for her sister Amelia to live with her.  It was, however,\\nnecessary to obtain her mother\\'s consent.  My grandmother had never seen\\nmy mother since the interview which she had had with her at Madeline\\nHall shortly after her marriage with Ben the marine.  Latterly, however,\\nthey had corresponded; for my mother, who was too independent to seek\\nher mother when she was merely the wife of a private marine, now that\\nshe was in flourishing circumstances had first tendered the olive\\nbranch, which had been accepted, as soon as my grandmother found that\\nshe was virtually separated from her husband.  As my grandmother found\\nit rather lonely at the isolated house in which she resided, and Amelia\\ndeclared herself bored to death, it was at last agreed that my\\ngrandmother and my aunt Amelia should both come and take up their\\nresidence with my mother, and in due time they arrived.  Milly, as my\\naunt was called, was three years younger than my mother, very pretty and\\nas smart as her sister, perhaps a little more demure in her look, but\\nwith more mischief in her disposition.  My grandmother was a cross,\\nspiteful old woman; she was very large in her person, but very\\nrespectable in her appearance.  I need not say that Miss Amelia did not\\nlessen the attraction at the circulating library, which after her\\narrival was even more frequented by the officers than before.\\n\\nMy aunt Milly was very soon as fond of me as I was of mischief; indeed\\nit is not to be wondered at, for I was a type of the latter.  I soon\\nloved her better than my mother, for she encouraged me in all my tricks.\\nMy mother looked grave, and occasionally scolded me; my grandmother\\nslapped me hard and rated me continually; but reproof or correction from\\nthe two latter were of no avail; and the former, when she wished to play\\nany trick which she dared not do herself, employed me as her agent; so\\nthat I obtained the whole credit for what were her inventions, and I may\\nsafely add, underwent the whole blame and punishment; but that I cared\\nnothing for; her caresses, cakes, and sugar-plums, added to my natural\\npropensity, more than repaid me for the occasional severe rebukes of my\\nmother, and the vindictive blows I received from the long fingers of my\\nworthy grandmother.  Moreover, the officers took much notice of me, and\\nit must be admitted, that, although I positively refused to learn my\\nletters, I was a very forward child.  My great patron was a Captain\\nBridgeman, a very thin, elegantly-made man, who was continually\\nperforming feats of address and activity; occasionally I would escape\\nwith him and go down to the mess, remain at dinner, drink toasts, and,\\nstanding on the mess-table, sing two or three comic songs which he had\\ntaught me.  I sometimes returned a little merry with the bumpers, which\\nmade my mother very angry, my old grandmother to hold up her hands, and\\nlook at the ceiling through her spectacles, and my aunt Milly as merry\\nas myself.  Before I was eight years old, I had become so notorious,\\nthat any prank played in the town, any trick undiscovered, was\\ninvariably laid to my account; and many were the applications made to my\\nmother for indemnification for broken windows and other damage done, too\\noften, I grant, with good reason, but very often when I had been\\nperfectly innocent of the misdemeanour.  At last I was voted a common\\nnuisance, and every one, except my mother and my aunt Milly, declared\\nthat it was high time that I went to school.\\n\\nOne evening the whole of the family were seated at tea in the back\\nparlour.  I was sitting very quietly and demurely in a corner, a sure\\nsign that I was in mischief, and so indeed I was (for I was putting a\\nlittle gunpowder into my grandmother\\'s snuff-box, which I had purloined,\\njust that she might \"smell powder,\" as they say at sea, without danger\\nof life or limb), when the old woman addressed my mother--\\n\\n\"Bella, is that boy never going to school? it will be the ruin of him.\"\\n\\n\"What will be the ruin of him, mother?\" rejoined my aunt Milly; \"going\\nto school?\"\\n\\n\"Hold your nonsense, child: you are as bad as the boy himself,\" replied\\ngranny.  \"Boys are never ruined by education; girls sometimes are.\"\\n\\nWhether my mother thought that this was an innuendo reflecting upon any\\nportion of her own life, I cannot tell; but she replied very tartly.\\n\\n\"You\\'re none the worse for my education, mother, or you would not be\\nsitting here.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, child,\" replied granny; \"but recollect, neither would you\\nhave married a marine--a private marine, Bella, while your sister looks\\nup to the officers.  Ay,\" continued the old woman, leaving off her\\nknitting and looking at her daughter, \"and is likely to get one, too, if\\nshe plays her cards well--that Lieutenant Flat can\\'t keep out of the\\nshop.\"  (My granny having at this moment given me an opportunity to\\nreplace her snuff-box, I did not fail to profit by it; and as I\\nperceived her knitting-pin had dropped on the floor, I stuck it into the\\nskirt of her gown behind, so that whenever she looked for it, it was\\ncertain ever to be behind her.)\\n\\n\"Mr Flat is of a very respectable family, I hear say,\" continued my\\ngrandmother.\\n\\n\"And a great fool,\" interrupted my mother.  \"I hope Milly won\\'t listen\\nto him.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s an officer,\" replied my granny, \"not a private.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I prefer my private marine, for I can make him do as I\\nplease; if he\\'s a private, I\\'m commanding officer, and intend so to be\\nas long as I live.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, Bella, let us say no more on the old score; but that boy\\nmust go to school.  Deary me, I have dropped my needle.\"\\n\\nMy grandmother rose, and turned round and round, looking for her needle,\\nwhich, strange to say, she could not find; she opened her snuff-box, and\\ntook a pinch to clear her optics.  \"Deary me, why, what\\'s the matter\\nwith my snuff? and where can that needle be?  Child, come and look for\\nthe needle; don\\'t be sticking there in that corner.\"\\n\\nI thought proper to obey the order and pretended to be very diligent in\\nmy search.  Catching aunt Milly\\'s eye, I pointed to the knitting-needle\\nsticking in the hind skirts of my grandmother\\'s gown, and then was down\\non my knees again, while my aunt held her handkerchief to her mouth to\\ncheck her laughter.\\n\\nA minute afterwards, Ben the marine first tapped gently, and then opened\\nthe door and came in; for at that late hour the officers were all at\\ndinner, and the shop empty.\\n\\n\"There are three parcels of books for you to take,\" said my mother; \"but\\nyou\\'ve plenty of time, so take down the tea-things, and get your tea in\\nthe kitchen before you go.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t got a shilling, Bella, about you?  I want some \\'baccy,\"\\nsaid Ben, in his quiet way.\\n\\n\"Yes, here\\'s a shilling, Ben; but don\\'t drink too much beer,\" replied my\\nmother.\\n\\n\"Deary me, what can have become of my needle?\" exclaimed my grandmother,\\nturning round.\\n\\n\"Here it is, ma\\'am,\" said Ben, who perceived it sticking in her skirt.\\n\"That\\'s Percival\\'s work, I\\'ll answer for it.\"\\n\\nMy granny received the needle from Ben, and then turned to me: \"You\\ngood-for-nothing boy; so you put the needle there, did you? pretending\\nto look for it all the while; you shall go to school, sir, that you\\nshall.\"\\n\\n\"You said a needle, granny; I was looking for a needle: you didn\\'t say\\nyour knitting-pin; I could have told you where that was.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, those who hide can find; to school you go, or I\\'ll not stay\\nin the house.\"\\n\\nBen took the tea-tray out of the room.  He had been well drilled in and\\nout of barracks.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go down in the kitchen to father,\" cried I, for I was tired of\\nsitting still.\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t, sir,\" said my mother, \"you naughty boy; the kitchen is\\nnot the place for you, and if ever I hear of you smoking a pipe again--\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman smokes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, he smokes cigars; but a child like you must not smoke a\\npipe.\"\\n\\n\"And now come here, sir,\" said my granny, who had the lid of her\\nsnuff-box off, and held it open in her hand; \"what have you been doing\\nwith my snuff?\"\\n\\n\"Why, granny, have I had your snuff-box the whole day?\"\\n\\n\"How should I know?--a boy like you, with every finger a fish-hook; I do\\nbelieve you have; I only wish I could find you out.  I had fresh snuff\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps they made a mistake at the shop, mother,\" said aunt Milly;\\n\"they are very careless.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can\\'t tell: I must have some more; I can\\'t take this.\"\\n\\n\"Throw it in the fire, granny,\" said I; \"and I\\'ll run with the box and\\nget it full again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it\\'s the best thing I can do,\" replied the old woman,\\nwho went to the grate, and leaning over, poured the snuff out on the\\nlive coals.  The result was a loud explosion and a volume of smoke,\\nwhich burst out of the grate into her face--the dinner and lappets\\nsinged, her spectacles lifted from her nose, and her face as black as a\\nsweep\\'s.  The old woman screamed, and threw herself back; in so doing,\\nshe fell over the chair upon which she had been sitting, and, somehow or\\nanother, tripped me up, and lay with all her weight upon me.  I had been\\njust attempting to make my escape during the confusion--for my mother\\nand Milly were equally frightened--when I found myself completely\\nsmothered by the weight of my now almost senseless granny, and, as I\\nhave before mentioned, she was a very corpulent woman.  Had I been in\\nany other position I should not have suffered so much; but I had\\nunfortunately fallen flat on my back, and was now lying with my face\\nupwards, pressed upon by the broadest part of the old woman\\'s body; my\\nnose was flattened, and my breath completely stopped.  How long my\\ngranny might have remained there groaning I cannot tell; probably, as I\\nwas somewhat a spoiled child before this, it might have ended in her\\ncompletely finishing me; but she was roused up from her state of half\\nsyncope by a vigorous attack from my teeth, which, in the agony of\\nsuffocation, I used with preternatural force of jaw from one so young.\\nI bit right through everything she had on, and as my senses were fast\\ndeparting, my teeth actually met with my convulsive efforts.  My granny,\\nroused by the extreme pain, rolled over on her side, and then it was\\nthat my mother and aunt, who supposed that I had made my escape from the\\nroom, discovered me lifeless, and black in the face.  They ran to me,\\nbut I still held on with my teeth, nor could I be separated from my now\\nscreaming relative, until the admission of fresh air, and a plentiful\\nsprinkling of cold water brought me to my senses, when I was laid on the\\nsofa utterly exhausted.  It certainly was a narrow escape, and it may be\\nsaid that the \"biter was nearly bit.\"  As for my granny, she recovered\\nher fright and her legs, but she did not recover her temper; she could\\nnot sit down without a pillow on the chair for many days, and, although\\nlittle was said to me in consequence of the danger I had incurred, yet\\nthere was an evident abhorrence of me on the part of the old woman, a\\nquiet manner about my mother, and a want of her usual hilarity on the\\npart of my aunt, which were to me a foreboding of something unpleasant.\\nA few days brought to light what was the result of various whisperings\\nand consultations.  It was on a fine Monday morning, that Ben made his\\nappearance at an unusually early hour; my cap was put on my head, my\\ncloak over my shoulders; Ben took me by the hand, having a covered\\nbasket in the other, and I was led away like a lamb to the butcher.  As\\nI went out there was a tear in the eyes of my aunt Milly, a melancholy\\nover the countenance of my mother, and a twinkling expression of\\nsatisfaction in my grandmother\\'s eyes, which even her spectacles could\\nnot conceal from me: the fact was, my grandmother had triumphed, and I\\nwas going to school.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR.\\n\\nAs soon as I was clear of the door, I looked up into Ben\\'s face and\\nsaid, \"Father, where are we going?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied he, \"I am going to take you to school.\"\\n\\n\"School!  What am I going to school for?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"For biting your grandmother, I expect, in the first place, and to get a\\nlittle learning, and a good deal of flogging, if what they say is true!\\nI never was at school myself.\"\\n\\n\"What do you learn, and why are you flogged?\"\\n\\n\"You learn to read, and to write, and to count; I can\\'t do either--\\nmore\\'s the pity; and you are flogged, because without flogging, little\\nboys can\\'t learn anything.\"\\n\\nThis was not a very satisfactory explanation.  I made no further\\ninquiries, and we continued our way in silence until we arrived at the\\nschool door; there was a terrible buzz inside.  Ben tapped, the door\\nopened, and a volume of hot air burst forth, all the fresh air having\\nbeen consumed in repeating the fresh lessons for the day.  Ben walked up\\nbetween the forms, and introduced me to the schoolmaster, whose name was\\nMr Thadeus O\\'Gallagher, a poor scholar from Ireland, who had set up an\\nestablishment at half-a-guinea a quarter for day scholars; he was\\nreckoned a very severe master, and the children were kept in better\\norder in his school than in any other establishment of the kind in the\\ntown; and I presume that my granny had made inquiries to that effect, as\\nthere were one or two schools of the same kind much nearer to my\\nmother\\'s house.  Ben, who probably had a great respect for learning, in\\nconsequence of his having none himself, gave a military salute to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, saying, with his hand still to his hat, \"A new boy, sir,\\ncome to school.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, by the powers! don\\'t I know him?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"it\\'s the\\nyoung gentleman who bit a hole in his grandmother; Master Keene, as they\\ncall him.  Keen teeth, at all events.  Lave him with me; and that\\'s his\\ndinner in the basket I presume; lave that too.  He\\'ll soon be a good\\nboy, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nBen put down the basket, turned on his heel, and left the schoolroom,\\nand me standing by the throne of my future pedagogue--I say throne,\\nbecause he had not a desk, as schoolmasters generally have, but a sort\\nof square dais, about eighteen inches high, on which was placed another\\noblong superstructure of the same height, serving him for a seat; both\\nparts were covered with some patched and torn old drugget, and upon\\nsubsequent examination I found them to consist of three old claret cases\\nwithout covers, which he had probably picked up very cheap; two of them\\nturned upside down, so as to form the lower square, and the third placed\\nin the same way upside down, upon the two lower.  Mr O\\'Gallagher sat in\\ngreat dignity upon the upper one, with his feet on the lower, being thus\\nsufficiently raised upon an eminence to command a view of the whole of\\nhis pupils in every part of the school.  He was not a tall man, but very\\nsquare built, with carroty hair and very bushy red whiskers; to me he\\nappeared a most formidable person, especially when he opened his large\\nmouth and displayed his teeth, when I was reminded of the sign of the\\nRed Lion close to my mother\\'s house.  I certainly never had been before\\nso much awed during my short existence as I was with the appearance of\\nmy pedagogue, who sat before me somewhat in the fashion of a Roman\\ntribune, holding in his hand a short round ruler, as if it were his\\ntruncheon of authority.  I had not been a minute in the school before I\\nobserved him to raise his arm; away went the ruler whizzing through the\\nair, until it hit the skull of the lad for whom it was intended at the\\nother end of the schoolroom.  The boy, who had been talking to his\\nneighbour, rubbed his poll, and whined.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you bring back my ruler, you spalpeen?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\"Be quick, Johnny Target, or it will end in a blow-up.\"\\n\\nThe boy, who was not a little confused with the blow, sufficiently\\nrecovered his senses to obey the order, and whimpering as he came up,\\nreturned the ruler to the hands of Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"That tongue of yours will get you into more trouble than it will\\nbusiness, I expect, Johnny Target; it\\'s an unruly member, and requires a\\nconstant ruler over it.\"  Johnny Target rubbed his head and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said he, after a short pause, \"did you see what a\\ntundering tump on the head that boy got just now, and do you know what\\nit was for?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your manners, you animal?  No `If you plase.\\'  For the future,\\nyou must not forget to say, `No, sir,\\' or, `No, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\'  D\\'ye\\nmind me--now say yes--what?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, what! you little ignoramus; say `yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\' and\\nrecollect, as the parish clerk says, `this is the last time of asking.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr O\\'Gallagher.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! now you see, there\\'s nothing like coming to school--you\\'ve learn\\'t\\nmanners already; and now, to go back again, as to why Johnny Target had\\nthe rap on the head, which brought tears into his eyes?  I\\'ll just tell\\nyou, it was for talking; you see, the first thing for a boy to learn, is\\nto hold his tongue, and that shall be your lesson for the day; you\\'ll\\njust sit down there and if you say one word during the whole time you\\nare in the school, it will end in a blow-up; that means, on the present\\noccasion, that I\\'ll skin you alive as they do the eels, which being\\nrather keen work, will just suit your constitution.\"  I had wit enough\\nto feel assured that Mr O\\'Gallagher was not to be trifled with, so I\\ntook my seat, and amused myself with listening to the various lessons\\nwhich the boys came up to say, and the divers punishments inflicted--few\\nescaped.  At last, the hour of recreation and dinner arrived, the boys\\nwere dismissed, each seized his basket, containing his provisions, or\\nran home to get his meal with his parents: I found myself sitting in the\\nschool-room _tete-a-tete_ with Mr O\\'Gallagher, and feeling very well\\ninclined for my dinner I cast a wistful eye at my basket, but I said\\nnothing; Mr O\\'Gallagher, who appeared to have been in thought, at last\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you may now go out of school, and scream till you\\'re hoarse,\\njust to make up for lost time.\"\\n\\n\"May I take my dinner, sir?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"Is it your dinner you mane?--to be sure you may; but, first, I\\'ll just\\nlook into the basket and its contents; for you see, Mr Keene, there\\'s\\nsome victuals that don\\'t agree with larning; and if you eat them, you\\'ll\\nnot be fit for your work when your play-hours are over.  What\\'s easy of\\ndigestion will do; but what\\'s bad for little boys\\' stomachs may get you\\ninto a scrape, and then it will end in a blow-up; that is, you\\'ll have a\\ntaste of the ferrule or the rod--two assistants of mine, to whom I\\'ve\\nnot yet had the pleasure of introducing you--all in good time.  If what\\nI\\'ve hear of you be true, you and they will be better acquainted afore\\nlong.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher then examined the contents of my basket; my aunt Milly\\nhad taken care that I should be well provided: there was a large paper\\nof beef sandwiches, a piece of bread and cheese, and three or four\\nslices of seed-cake.  Mr O\\'Gallagher opened all the packages, and,\\nafter a pause, said--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, d\\'ye think you would ever guess how I came by all my\\nlarning, and what I fed upon when it was pumped into me?  Then I\\'ll tell\\nyou; it was dry bread, with a little bit of cheese when I could get it,\\nand that wasn\\'t often.  Bread and cheese is the food to make a scholar\\nof ye; and mayhap one slice of the cake mayn\\'t much interfere, so take\\nthem, and run away to the play-ground as fast as you can; and, d\\'ye hear\\nme, Master Keene, recollect your grace before meat--`For what we have\\nreceived, the Lord make us truly thankful.\\'  Now, off wid you.  The rest\\nof the contents are confiscated for my sole use, and your particular\\nbenefit.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher grinned as he finished his oration; and he looked so\\nmuch like a wild beast, that I was glad to be off as fast as I could.  I\\nturned round as I went out of the door, and perceived that the\\nsandwiches were disappearing with wonderful rapidity; but I caught his\\neye: it was like that of a tiger\\'s at his meal, and I was off at\\nredoubled speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE.\\n\\nAs soon as I gained the play-ground, which was, in fact, nothing more\\nthan a small piece of waste land, to which we had no more claim than any\\nother people, I sat down by a post, and commenced my dinner off what Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had thought proper to leave me.  I was afraid of him, it is\\ntrue, for his severity to the other boys convinced me that he would have\\nlittle mercy upon me, if I dared to thwart him; but indignation soon\\nbegan to obtain the mastery over my fears and I began to consider if I\\ncould not be even with him for his barefaced robbery of my dinner; and\\nthen I reflected whether it would not be better to allow him to take my\\nfood if I found out that by so doing he treated me well; and I resolved,\\nat all events, to delay a little.  The hour of play was now over, and a\\nbell summoned us all to school; I went in with the others and took my\\nseat where Mr O\\'Gallagher had before desired me.\\n\\nAs soon as all was silent, my pedagogue beckoned me to him.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"you\\'ll be so good as to lend me your ears--\\nthat is, to listen while I talk to you a little bit.  D\\'ye know how many\\nroads there are to larning?  Hold your tongue.  I ask you because I know\\nyou don\\'t know, and because I\\'m going to tell you.  There are exactly\\nthree roads: the first is the eye, my jewel; and if a lad has a sharp\\neye like yours, it\\'s a great deal that will get into his head by that\\nroad; you\\'ll know a thing when you see it again, although you mayn\\'t\\nknow your own father--that\\'s a secret only known to your mother.  The\\nsecond road to larning, young spalpeen, is the ear; and if you mind all\\npeople say, and hear all you can, you\\'ll gain a great many truths and\\njust ten times as much more in the shape of lies.  You see the wheat and\\nthe chaff will come together, and you must pick the latter out of the\\nformer at any seasonable future opportunity.  Now we come to the third\\nroad to larning, which is quite a different sort of road; because, you\\nsee, the two first give us little trouble, and we trot along almost\\nwhether we will or not: the third and grand road is the head itself,\\nwhich requires the eye and the ear to help it; and two other assistants,\\nwhich we call memory and application; so you see we have the visual,\\nthen the aural, and then the mental roads--three hard words which you\\ndon\\'t understand, and which I shan\\'t take the trouble to explain to such\\nan animal as you are; for I never throw away pearls to swine, as the\\nsaying is.  Now, then, Mr Keene, we must come to another part of our\\nhistory.  As there are three roads to larning, so there are three manes\\nor implements by which boys are stimulated to larn: the first is the\\nruler, which you saw me shy at the thick skull of Johnny Target, and you\\nsee\\'d what a rap it gave him; well, then, the second is the ferrule--a\\nthing you never heard of, perhaps; but I\\'ll show it you; here it is,\"\\ncontinued Mr O\\'Gallagher, producing a sort of flat wooden ladle with a\\nhole in the centre of it.  \"The ruler is for the head, as you have seen;\\nthe ferrule is for the hand.  You have seen me use the ruler; now I\\'ll\\nshow you what I do with the ferrule.\"\\n\\n\"You Tommy Goskin, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nTommy Goskin put down his book, and came up to his master with a good\\ndeal of doubt in his countenance.\\n\\n\"Tommy Goskin, you didn\\'t say your lesson well to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I did, Mr O\\'Gallagher,\" replied Tommy, \"you said I did yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, sir, you didn\\'t say it well yesterday,\" continued Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"Yes I did, sir,\" replied the boy, whimpering.\\n\\n\"And is it you who dares to contradict me?\" cried Mr O\\'Gallagher; \"at\\nall events, you won\\'t say it well to-morrow, so hold out your right\\nhand.\"\\n\\nPoor Tommy held it out, and roared lustily at the first blow, wringing\\nhis fingers with the smart.\\n\\n\"Now your left hand, sir; fair play is a jewel; always carry the dish\\neven.\"\\n\\nTommy received a blow on his left hand, which was followed up with\\nsimilar demonstrations of suffering.\\n\\n\"There sir you may go now,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"and mind you don\\'t do\\nit again; or else there\\'ll be a blow-up.  And now Master Keene, we come\\nto the third and last, which is the birch for the tail--here it is--have\\nyou ever had a taste?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, you have that pleasure to come, and come it will, I don\\'t\\ndoubt, if you and I are a few days longer acquainted.  Let me see--\"\\n\\nHere Mr O\\'Gallagher looked round the school, as if to find a culprit;\\nbut the boys, aware of what was going on, kept their eyes so attentively\\nto their books, that he could not discover one; at last he singled out a\\nfat chubby lad.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, come here, sir.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock came accordingly; evidently he gave himself up for lost.\\n\\n\"Walter Puddock, I just have been telling Master Keene that you\\'re the\\nbest Latin scholar in the whole school.  Now, sir, don\\'t make me out to\\nbe a liar--do me credit,--or, by the blood of the O\\'Gallaghers, I\\'ll\\nflog ye till you\\'re as thin as a herring.  What\\'s the Latin for a cocked\\nhat, as the Roman gentlemen wore with their _togeys_?\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock hesitated a few seconds, and then, without venturing a\\nword of remonstrance, let down his trousers.\\n\\n\"See now the guilty tief, he knows what\\'s coming.  Shame upon you,\\nWalter Puddock, to disgrace your preceptor so, and make him tell a lie\\nto young Master Keene.  Where\\'s Phil Mooney?  Come along, sir, and hoist\\nWalter Puddock: it\\'s no larning that I can drive into you, Phil, but\\nit\\'s sartain sure that by your manes I drive a little into the other\\nboys.\"\\n\\nWalter Puddock, as soon as he was on the back of Phil Mooney, received a\\ndozen cuts with the rod, well laid on.  He bore it without flinching,\\nalthough the tears rolled down his cheeks.\\n\\n\"There, Walter Puddock, I told you it would end in a blow-up; go to your\\ndictionary, you dirty blackguard, and do more credit to your education\\nand superior instruction from a certain person who shall be nameless.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher laid the rod on one side, and then continued--\\n\\n\"Now, Master Keene, I\\'ve just shown you the three roads to larning, and\\nalso the three implements to persuade little boys to larn; if you don\\'t\\ntravel very fast by the three first, why you will be followed up very\\nsmartly by the three last--a nod\\'s as good as a wink to a blind horse,\\nany day; and one thing more, you little spalpeen, mind that there\\'s more\\nmustard to the sandwiches to-morrow, or else it will end in a blow-up.\\nNow you\\'ve got the whole theory of the art of tuition, Master Keene;\\nplease the pigs, we\\'ll commence with the practice to-morrow.\"\\n\\nMy worthy pedagogue did not address me any more during that day; the\\nschool broke up at five, and I made haste home, thinking over all that\\nhad passed in the school-room.\\n\\nMy granny and mother were both anxious to know what had passed; the\\nfirst hoped that I had been flogged, the second that I had not, but I\\nrefused to communicate.  I assumed a haughty, indifferent air, for I was\\nangry with my mother, and as for my grandmother, I hated her.  Aunt\\nMilly, however, when we were alone, did not question me in vain.  I told\\nher all that had passed; she bade me be of good heart, and that I should\\nnot be ill-treated if she could help it.\\n\\nI replied, that if I were ill-treated, I would have my revenge somehow\\nor another.  I then went down to the barracks, to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him what had occurred.  He advised me to laugh at\\nthe ruler, the ferrule, and the rod.  He pointed out to me the necessity\\nof my going to school and learning to read and write, at the same time\\nwas very indignant at the conduct of Mr O\\'Gallagher, and told me to\\nresist in every way any injustice or tyranny, and that I should be sure\\nof his support and assistance, provided that I did pay attention to my\\nstudies.\\n\\nFortified by the advice and protection of my two great friends, I made\\nup my mind that I would learn as fast as I could, but if treated ill,\\nthat I would die a martyr, rather than yield to oppression; at all\\nevents, I would, if possible, play Mr O\\'Gallagher a trick for every\\nflogging or punishment I received; and with this laudable resolution I\\nwas soon fast asleep, too fast even to dream.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX.\\n\\nWhen my aunt Milly called me in the morning, that I might be up and have\\nmy breakfast in time for school, I felt as if two years had passed over\\nmy head during the last twenty-four hours.  I had never witnessed\\ntyranny until the day before, and my blood was heated with indignation:\\nI felt myself capable of anything and everything.\\n\\nMy anger was about as great towards my mother and grandmother for having\\nsent me to such a place, as it was against Mr O\\'Gallagher.  Instead of\\ngoing up and kissing my mother, I paid no attention to either her or my\\ngrandmother, much to the mortification of the former and surprise of the\\nlatter, who said, in a very cross manner, \"Where\\'s your manners, child?\\nwhy don\\'t you say good morning?\"\\n\\n\"Because I have not been long enough at school to learn manners,\\ngranny.\"\\n\\n\"Come and kiss me before you go, my child,\" said my mother.\\n\\n\"No, mother; you have sent me to school to be beat, and I never will\\nkiss you again.\"\\n\\n\"Naughty, good-for-nothing boy!\" exclaimed my granny; \"what a bad heart\\nyou must have.\"\\n\\n\"No, that he has not,\" cried my aunt Milly.  \"Sister should have\\ninquired what sort of a school it was before she sent him.\"\\n\\n\"I made every inquiry,\" replied my granny; \"he can\\'t play tricks there.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t I?\" cried I, \"but I will; and not only there but here.  I\\'ll be\\neven with you all; yes, I\\'ll be even with you, granny, if I die for it.\"\\n\\n\"Why, you audacious wretch, I\\'ve great a mind to--\"\\n\\n\"I dare say you have, but recollect I can bite; you\\'d better be quiet,\\ngranny, or, as the master says, `it will end in a blow-up.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Only hear the little wretch,\" said my granny, lifting up her hands; \"I\\nshall see you hanged yet, you ungrateful child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not ungrateful,\" replied I, throwing my arms round Milly\\'s neck,\\nand kissing her with fervour; \"I can love those who love me.\"\\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t love me?\" said my mother, reproachfully.\\n\\n\"I did yesterday, but I don\\'t now; but it\\'s time for me to go, aunt; is\\nmy basket ready?  I don\\'t want father to take me to school, I can do\\nwithout him, and when I don\\'t choose to go any more, I won\\'t; recollect\\nthat, mother.\"  So saying, I seized my basket and quitted the room.\\nThere was a long consultation, I found, after my departure: my mother,\\nwhen my aunt had informed her of Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s conduct, wished to\\nremove me instantly; my grandmother insisted upon it that there was not\\na word of truth in what I had said, and threatened that if I did not\\nremain at that very school, she would leave Chatham, and take my aunt\\nwith her.  As my mother could not part with aunt Milly, the consequence\\nwas, that my grandmother gained the day.\\n\\nI arrived in good time, and took my seat near my master.  I preferred\\ndoing this, as I had had a long conversation with Captain Bridgeman who\\ntold me that although Mr O\\'Gallagher had put the ruler down as\\npunishment Number 1, the ferrule Number 2, and the birch as Number 3,\\nand of course they were considered to be worse as the number rose, that\\nhe considered it to be the very contrary, as he had had them all well\\napplied when he was at school; he ordered me, therefore, never to hold\\nout my hand to the ferrule, by which refusal I should, of course, be\\nflogged; but he assured me that the birch, especially when it is given\\noften, was a mere nothing.  Now I considered that the surest way to\\navoid the ruler was to sit close to my master, who could then have no\\npretence for sending it at my head; the fact was I had determined to\\nsave the more noble portions of my body, and leave Mr O\\'Gallagher to do\\nwhat he pleased with the other: to do him justice, he lost no time.\\n\\n\"Come here, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"where\\'s your manners? why don\\'t you\\nsay good morning to your preceptor?  Can you read at all?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'ye know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I think I do, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Some of them--I suppose about two out of six-and-twenty.  It\\'s\\nparticular attention that\\'s been paid to your education, I perceive;\\nyou\\'ve nothing to unlearn anyhow, that\\'s something.  Now, sir, do you\\nthink that a classical scholar and a gentleman born, like me, is to\\ndemane myself by hearing you puzzle at the alphabet?  You\\'re quite\\nmistaken, Mr Keene, you must gain your first elements second-hand; so\\nwhere\\'s Thimothy Ruddel?  You, Timothy Ruddel, you\\'ll just teach this\\nyoung Master Keene his whole alphabet, and take care, at the same time,\\nthat you know your own lessons, or it will end in a blow-up; and you,\\nMaster Keene, if you have not larnt your whole alphabet perfect by\\ndinner time, why you\\'ll have a small taste of Number 2, just as a hint\\nto what\\'s coming next.  Go along, you little ignorant blackguard; and\\nyou, Timothy Ruddel, look out for a taste of Number 3, if you don\\'t larn\\nhim and yourself all at once, and at the same time.\"\\n\\nI was very well pleased with this arrangement; I had resolved to learn,\\nand I was doubly stimulated to learn now, to save poor Timothy Ruddel\\nfrom an unjust punishment.\\n\\nIn the three hours I was quite perfect, and Timothy Ruddel, who was\\ncalled up before me, was also able to say his lesson without a blunder\\nvery much to the disappointment of Mr O\\'Gallagher, who observed, \"So\\nyou\\'ve slipped through my fingers, have you, this time, Master Timothy?\\nNever mind, I\\'ll have you yet; and, moreover, there\\'s Master Keene to go\\nthrough the fiery furnace.\"  Just before dinner time I was called up;\\nwith my memory of many of the letters, and the assistance I had received\\nfrom Timothy Ruddel, I felt very confident.\\n\\n\"What letter\\'s that, sir?\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher.\\n\\n\"A B C D E.\"\\n\\n\"You little blackguard, I\\'ll dodge you; you think to escape, you?\"\\n\\n\"V, X, P, O.\"\\n\\nMuch to Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s surprise I said them all without one mistake.\\nInstead of commendation I received abuse.  \"By all the powers,\"\\nexclaimed my pedagogue, \"but everything seems to go wrong to-day; my\\nhand has been completely idle; this will never do; didn\\'t you tell me,\\nMr Keene, that you didn\\'t know your letters?\"\\n\\n\"I said I knew some of them, sir.\"\\n\\n\"If my memory is correct, Mr Keene, you told me that you knew two out\\nof twenty-six.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, you said that.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just as much as to tell me, your preceptor, a classical scholar,\\nand a Milesian gentleman to boot, that I lie, for which I intend to have\\nsatisfaction, Mr Keene, I assure you.  You\\'re guilty in two counts, as\\nthey say at the Old Bailey, where you\\'ll be called up to some of these\\ndays, as sure as you stand there; one count is in telling me a lie, in\\nsaying you did not know your alphabet, when it\\'s quite clear that you\\ndid; and, secondly, in giving me the lie, by stating that I said what\\nyou said.  You thought to escape me, but you\\'re mistaken, Mr Keene; so\\nnow, if you please, we will just have a taste of Number 2.  Hould out\\nyour hand, Mr Keene: d\\'ye hear me sir? hould out your hand.\"\\n\\nBut this I positively refused to do.  \"You won\\'t, won\\'t you?  Well,\\nthen, we must increase the punishment for our contempt of court, and at\\nonce commence with Number 3, which we intended to reserve till\\nto-morrow.  Come along, Phil Mooney, there\\'s fresh mate for you to\\ncarry, and come out Number 3, here\\'s fresh ground for you to travel\\nover.\"\\n\\nPhil Mooney and the birch soon made their appearance: I was hoisted by\\nthe one and scourged by the other.\\n\\nThe first taste of the birch is anything but agreeable; I could only\\ncompare it to the dropping of molten lead.  I tried all I could to\\nprevent crying out, but it was impossible, and at last I roared like a\\nmad bull; and I was as mad as a bull, and as dangerous.  Could I have\\npicked up any weapon at the moment that I was dropped from the shoulders\\nof Phil Mooney, it would have gone hard with Mr O\\'Gallagher.  My rage\\nwas greater than my agony.  I stood when I had been landed, my chest\\nheaving, my teeth set fast, and my apparel still in disorder.  The\\nschool was dismissed, and I was left alone with the savage pedagogue,\\nwho immediately took up my basket, and began to rummage the contents.\\n\\n\"Make yourself decent, Mr Keene, and don\\'t be shocking my modesty, and\\ntaking away my appetite.  Did you mention the mustard, as I desired you?\\nUpon my faith, but you\\'re a nice boy and do justice to the\\nrepresentations of your grandmother, and when you see her you may tell\\nher that I did not forget the promise she exacted from me.  You forgot\\nall about the mustard, you little blackguard.  If Phil Mooney was here I\\nwould give you another taste to freshen your memory for to-morrow;\\nhowever, to-morrow will do as well, if the mistake\\'s not corrected.\\nHere, take your victuals, and good appetite to you, you little monster\\nof iniquity.\"\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher tossed me some bread but this time reserved the cheese\\nfor his own eating.  I had adjusted my dress, and I therefore left the\\nschool-room.  I could not sit down without pain, so I leant against a\\npost: the bread remained in my hand untouched; had it been the greatest\\ndelicacy in the world I could not have tasted a morsel; I was giddy from\\nexcess of feeling, my thoughts were rapidly chasing each other when I\\nheard a voice close to me; I looked round, it was Walter Puddock, who\\nhad been flogged the day before.\\n\\n\"Never mind, Keene,\" said he, kindly; \"it hurts at first, but the more\\nyou get it the less you care for it; I don\\'t mind it a bit now; I cries,\\nbecause he goes on flogging till you do, and it\\'s no use having more\\nthan you can help.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t deserve it,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not necessary; you\\'ll get it, as we all do, whether you deserve\\nit or not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try to deserve it in future,\" replied I, clenching my fist;\\n\"I\\'ll be even with him.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what can you do?\"\\n\\n\"Wait a little, and you\\'ll see,\" said I, walking away, for an idea had\\ncome into my head which I wished to follow up.\\n\\nSoon afterwards the bell rang, and we returned to the schoolroom.  I was\\nput under the tuition of another boy, and took care to learn my lesson.\\nWhether it was that he was tired with the exercise, for he flogged and\\nferruled a dozen during that afternoon, or that he thought that my\\nmorning dose had been sufficient, I received no more punishment on that\\nday.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\\n\\nAs soon as school was dismissed, I went straight to the rooms of Captain\\nBridgeman, and told him how I had been treated.  As soon as he heard it,\\nhe exclaimed, \"This is really too bad; I will go with you, and I will\\nconsult with your aunt Amelia.\"\\n\\nIt so happened that aunt Milly was alone in the shop when we arrived,\\nand after a detail of what had passed, she told Captain Bridgeman that\\nmy grandmother had put me to that school out of feelings of ill-will for\\nthe tricks I had played, and had threatened that if I were removed she\\nwould leave Chatham and take her away with her.  My mother required\\nassistance in the shop, and was afraid to affront my grandmother, who\\nwas a very dictatorial, positive old woman, and would certainly keep her\\nresolution; but that rather than I should be treated in such a barbarous\\nmanner she would insist upon my mother taking me away, or would herself\\nleave the place.\\n\\n\"It would never do for you to leave us, Miss Amelia,\" replied Captain\\nBridgeman, \"there are but few attractions in this place, and we cannot\\nspare you; the whole corps would go into deep mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to leave the school,\" interrupted I; \"I would not leave it\\ntill I am revenged, for all the world.  Now, I\\'ll tell you what I want\\nto do--and do it I will, if he cuts me to pieces.  He eats my\\nsandwiches, and tells me if there\\'s not more mustard to-morrow, he\\'ll\\nflog me.  He shall have plenty of mustard, but he shall have something\\nelse.  What can I put into the sandwiches, so as to half kill him?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, my little Percival,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"I\\'ll just\\nask the doctor how much calomel a man may take without a coroner\\'s\\ninquest being required.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that will do nicely,\" said my aunt; \"I\\'ll take care he shall have\\nmustard enough not to perceive it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll go to the barracks and be back directly,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman.\\n\\n\"And I\\'m ready for the flogging as soon as the sandwiches are down his\\nthroat,\" replied I, laughing, \"I don\\'t care a fig for it.\"\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman soon returned with forty grains of calomel, which he\\ndelivered into aunt Milly\\'s hands.  \"That is as much as we dare give the\\nstrongest man without running great danger; we\\'ll try the effect of that\\nupon him, and if he don\\'t improve, I think I shall go up to the school\\nmyself and threaten him.\"\\n\\n\"As for that,\" replied aunt Milly, \"I\\'m sure that sister, if she hears\\nwhat\\'s going on, as she cannot take Percival away, will order her\\nhusband, Ben, to go up and thrash him.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bad idea, Miss Amelia, we\\'ll try that if we find it necessary; at\\nall events, we\\'ll see who can persecute most.\"\\n\\n\"Granny has told him to treat me ill,\" said I, \"that\\'s very clear, from\\nwhat he said; never mind, I\\'ll make her sorry for it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh Percival! you must not do anything to granny,\" said aunt Milly,\\nlooking very archly; \"I must not hear anything of the kind.\"\\n\\nThe next morning I set off with a full conviction that I should be\\nflogged before night, and notwithstanding that, as full of joy as if I\\nwas going to the fair.\\n\\nThe morning passed as usual; I said my lesson, but not very well; I was\\nthinking so much of my anticipated revenge, that I could not pay\\nattention to my teacher, who was, as usual, one of the boys.\\n\\n\"Master Keene,\" said Mr O\\'Gallagher, \"we\\'ll let the account stand over\\ntill the evening, and then I\\'ll give you a receipt in full; I may have\\none or two lines to add to it before the sun goes down; you\\'ll not\\nescape me this time, anyhow.\"\\n\\nThe boys went out at the dinner hour, leaving me, as before, to wait for\\nmy basket, after the tyrant had helped himself.  I stood by him in\\nsilence while he was rummaging its contents.\\n\\n\"Now, Mr Keene, I\\'ll see if you\\'ve remembered my particular injunction\\nrelative to the mustard.\"\\n\\n\"I told my aunt to put more mustard, sir,\" replied I, humbly, \"it she\\nthat cuts the sandwiches.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, if your aunt has not complied with your request, see if I\\ndon\\'t flay you alive, you little imp of abomination.\"\\n\\nThe sandwiches were pulled out of the paper and tasted.  \"Down on your\\nknees, Mr Keene, and thank all the blessed saints that your aunt has\\nsaved you from at least one-half of what I intended to administer to you\\nthis blessed afternoon, for she has doubled the mustard, you tief,\" said\\nMr O\\'Gallagher, speaking with his mouth as full as it could hold.  Down\\nwent sandwich after sandwich, until they had all disappeared.  Oh! what\\njoy was mine!  I could have tossed up my cap and leapt in the air.\\nHaving received the bread and cheese, for he permitted me to have the\\nlatter on this occasion I went out and enjoyed my meal, delighted with\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s having fallen into the trap I had laid for him.\\n\\nThe bell summoned us in, and all went on as usual for the first two\\nhours, when I thought Mr O\\'Gallagher changed countenance and looked\\nvery pale.  He continued, however, to hear the lessons, until at last I\\nperceived him pass his hand up and down and across his stomach, as if he\\nhad had a twinge; a few minutes afterwards, he compressed his thick\\nlips, and then put his hands to his abdomen.\\n\\n\"Ah! he begins to feel it now,\" thought I; and sure enough he did; for\\nthe pain increased so rapidly that he lost all patience, and vented his\\nfeelings by beating with his ruler, on the heads of the whole class of\\nboys standing up before him, till one or two dropped down, stunned with\\nthe blows.  At last he dropped the ruler, and, pressing both hands to\\nhis stomach, he rolled himself backwards and forwards, and then twisted\\nand distorted his legs till he could bear the pain no longer; and he\\ngave vent to a tremendous Irish howl--grinning and grinding his teeth\\nfor a few seconds, and then howling again, writhing and twisting in\\nevident agony--while the perspiration ran off his forehead.\\n\\n\"Och! murder!  I\\'m poisoned sure.  Lord save my sinful soul!  Oh--oh--\\noh! eh--eh--eh! mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy!  Oh holy St. Patrick!\\nI\\'m kilt entirely:\"--and so subdued was he at last by the pain, that he\\nburst out into a flood of tears, crying and roaring like a child.\\n\\nAgain the paroxysms came on--\"Murder, murder, murder!\" shrieked the\\nwretch at the highest pitch of his voice, so that he was heard at some\\ndistance, and some of the neighbours came in to inquire what was the\\nmatter.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher was now in a fainting state, and leaning against the\\ntable, he could merely say in a low voice, \"A doctor--quick--a doctor.\"\\n\\nThe neighbours perceiving how ill he was, led him out of the\\nschool-rooms into his own apartment, one going for a doctor, and the\\nothers telling the boys they might all go home, a notice of which they\\ngladly availed themselves.\\n\\nI need hardly say, that I made all the haste I could to communicate the\\nsuccessful result of my trick to Milly and Captain Bridgeman.  The\\nmedical man who was summoned, gave Mr O\\'Gallagher some very active\\nmedicine, which assisted to rid him of the calomel; of his having taken\\nwhich, of course, the medical man was ignorant.  The violence of the\\ndose was, however, so great, and left him in such a state, that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher could not leave his room for three days, nor resume his seat\\nin the school until a week had elapsed, during which I remained at home\\nplotting still further mischief.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher resumed his occupations, and I was again sent off to\\nschool.  When I entered the school-room I found him looking very pale\\nand cadaverous; as soon as he saw me his lips were drawn apart, and he\\nshowed his large white teeth, reminding me of the grinning of a hyena;\\nhe did not, however, say anything to me.  My studies were resumed; I\\nsaid my lesson perfectly, but was fully prepared for punishment.  I was,\\nhowever, agreeably disappointed; he did not punish either me or any of\\nthe other boys.\\n\\nI afterwards found out the reason was, that, although necessity\\ncompelled him to re-open his school as soon as he could, he was too weak\\nto undergo the fatigue of following up his favourite diversion.\\n\\nWhen the dinner-hour arrived, and the boys were dismissed, I waited\\npatiently to see what he would do with my basket, which stood beside\\nhim.  \"Take your basket, and eat your dinner, Master Keene,\" said he,\\nwalking out of the school-room into his own apartments.  I could not\\nhelp saying, \"Won\\'t you have the sandwiches, sir?\"\\n\\nHe turned round and gave me a look so penetrating and so diabolical,\\nthat I felt sure that he knew to whom he had been indebted for his late\\nsevere illness.\\n\\nFrom this day forward Mr O\\'G never interfered with the contents of my\\nbasket and I had my dinner all to myself.  The shock which had been\\ngiven to his constitution was so great, that for three or four months he\\nmay be said to have crawled to his school room, and I really began to\\nthink that the affair would turn out more serious than was intended; but\\ngradually he regained his strength, and as he recovered his vigour, so\\ndid he resume his severity.\\n\\nBut I was a great gainer during the three or four months of quiet which\\nreigned during Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s convalescence.  Since I have been grown\\nup, I have often thought, and am indeed confirmed in my opinion, that we\\nlose rather than gain by being educated at too early an age.  Commence\\nwith one child at three years, and with another at seven years old, and\\nin ten years, the one whose brain was left fallow even till seven years\\nold, will be quite as far, if not further advanced, than the child whose\\nintellect was prematurely forced at the earlier age; this is a fact\\nwhich I have since seen proved in many instances, and it certainly was\\ncorroborated in mine.\\n\\nIn six months I could read and write very fairly, and had commenced\\narithmetic; true, I was stimulated on by the advice of Captain\\nBridgeman, the love I bore my aunt Milly, and the hatred which I had for\\nmy master, which made me resolve that I would not deserve punishment on\\nthat score.\\n\\nIt was in May that I administered the dose to Mr O\\'Gallagher; in\\nSeptember he was quite well again, and the ruler, the ferrule, and the\\nrod, were triumphantly at work.  It is useless to say how often I was\\npunished, for it was every day; always once, sometimes twice; I became\\ncompletely callous to it, nay, laughed at it, but my mind was ever at\\nwork upon some mischief, in the way of retaliation.\\n\\nI put little pancakes of cobblers\\' wax on Mr O\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, and\\nhe had the pleasure of finding himself stuck fast by the breeches when\\nhe rose up to punish.  I anointed the handle of the ferrule and rod with\\nbird-lime; put dead cats under the claret cases, which composed his seat\\nof authority, so that the smell would drive him distracted before he\\nfound it out.  I drew up with a squirt, all the ink which was in the\\ninkstands fixed in the writing-desks, so as not to be taken out of the\\nsockets, and made good the deficiency with water, which put him to no\\nlittle expense.\\n\\nI once made him almost frantic, by rubbing his handkerchief which always\\nlaid by his side, and with which he was accustomed to wipe his face\\nevery five minutes (for he was profuse in his perspiration), with what\\nis called cow-itch: not being aware of what was the cause, he wiped his\\nface more and more, until he was as red as a peony, and the itching\\nbecame intolerable.\\n\\nOn such occasions he never inquired who was the party, but called me and\\nPhil Mooney.  I, on the other hand, never said a word in way of\\nexpostulation.  I took my flogging, which was as severe as he could give\\nit, as a matter of course, quite satisfied with the exchange.\\n\\nAs Walter Puddock had told me, and, as I have no doubt, the Eton boys\\nwill confirm, after a certain quantity of flagellations, the skin\\nbecomes so hard as to make the punishment almost a matter of\\nindifference and so I found it.  So passed the time until the month of\\nNovember, when I was fully enabled to pay off my worthy pedagogue for\\nall that I was indebted to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\\n\\nThe boys had been saving up all their money to purchase fireworks for\\nthe celebrated 5th of November--a day on which it was said that certain\\npersons, finding it impossible to reform the Lords and Commons, had\\ndetermined to get rid of them at once: why they have not been in similar\\ndanger every year since the first attempt was made, I know not; certain\\nit is, that it is the only reform measure that can ever be effectual.\\nGuy Fawkes and his confederates, whether Popish or Protestant, from the\\ndisregard of human life, certainly proved themselves the founders of a\\nparty, still existing, whose motto is, \"Measures and not Men.\"\\n\\nBut to proceed: Mr O\\'Gallagher had never before attempted to interfere\\nwith the vested rights of urchins on that day; being, however, in a most\\nparticular irascible humour, instead of a whole, he made it known that\\nthere would only be a half, holiday, and we were consequently all called\\nin for morning lessons instead of carrying about, as we had intended,\\nthe effigy of the only true reformer that ever existed in this country.\\n\\nThis made us all very sulky and discontented in the first place, and our\\nanxiety to get out of school was so great, that the lessons were not\\nvery perfect in the second.  The ferrule and rod were called out and\\nliberally administered; but what was our horror and dismay when Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, about an hour before dinner, announced to us that all the\\nsquibs and crackers, with which our pockets were crammed, were to be\\ngiven up immediately; and that, as we had not said our lessons well,\\nthere would be no half-holiday, the whole school were in mute despair.\\n\\nOne by one were the boys summoned up to the throne of Mr O\\'Gallagher,\\nand their pockets searched by Phil Mooney, who emptied them of their\\npyrotechnical contents, all of which were deposited on the dais of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher\\'s throne, which, I have before observed, was composed of two\\nempty claret cases turned upside down, surmounted by another, on which\\nMr O\\'Gallagher sat, all three covered with old green baize.\\n\\nBy the time that the whole school had been rifled, the heap of fireworks\\nwas very considerable, and Mr O\\'Gallagher, to prevent any of them being\\nrecovered by the boys, lifted up the claret case on which he sat, and\\nwhich was on the top of the other two, and desired Phil Mooney to put\\nthem all underneath it.  This was done; Mr O\\'Gallagher resumed his\\nseat, and the lessons continued till the dinner hour arrived, but, alas!\\nnot the half-holiday or the fireworks.\\n\\nThe boys went out; some mournful, some angry, some sulky, some\\nfrightened; a few, a very few, declaiming against such injustice.\\n\\nI was in a rage; my blood boiled; at last my invention came to my aid,\\nand, without considering the consequences, I determined how to act.\\n\\nAs it was an hour and a half before school would commence, I hastened\\nhome, and, having spent all my money, begged aunt Milly to give me some;\\nshe gave me a shilling, and with that I bought as much gunpowder as I\\ncould procure, more than a quarter of a pound.\\n\\nI then returned to the school, looked into the school-room, and found it\\nempty; I quickly raised up the claret case, under which the fireworks\\nhad been placed, put the powder under it, leaving only sufficient for a\\nvery small train, which would not be perceived in the green baize\\ncovering; having so done, I left the school-room immediately, and\\nrejoined my companions.  I had a piece of touch-wood, as all the boys\\nhad, to let off their fireworks with, and this I lighted and left in a\\ncorner until the bell should summons us into school.\\n\\nOh! how my heart beat when I heard the sound, so full was I of anxiety\\nlest my project should fail.\\n\\nOnce more we were all assembled.  Mr O\\'Gallagher surveying, with the\\nsmile of a demon, the unhappy and disappointed faces of the boys, was\\nagain perched upon his throne, the rod on one side, the ferrule on the\\nother, and the ruler, that dreaded truncheon of command, clenched in his\\nbroad fist.\\n\\nI had the touchwood lighted and concealed in my hand; gradually I moved\\ndownwards, until at last, unperceived by Mr O\\'Gallagher, I was behind\\nhim, and close to my train of gunpowder.  I gave one look to ascertain\\nif he had observed me; his eye was roving over the school for some\\ndelinquent to throw his ruler at; fearful that he might turn round to\\nme, I no longer hesitated, and the touchwood was applied to the train.\\n\\nIgnorant as I was of the force of gunpowder, it was with astonishment,\\nmingled with horror, that I beheld, in a second, the claret case rise up\\nas if it had wings, and Mr O\\'Gallagher thrown up to the ceiling\\nenveloped in a cloud of smoke, the crackers and squibs fizzing and\\nbanging, while the boys in the school uttered a yell of consternation\\nand fear as they rushed from from the explosion, and afterwards,\\ntumbling over one another, made their escape from the school-room.\\n\\nThe windows had all been blown out with a terrible crash, and the whole\\nschool-room was now covered by the smoke.  There I stood in silent\\ndismay at the mischief which I had done.  The squibs and crackers had\\nnot, however, all finished popping, before I heard the howling of Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, who had fallen down upon the centre school-room table.\\n\\nI was still in the school-room, half-suffocated, yet not moving away\\nfrom where I stood, when the neighbours, who had been alarmed by the\\nexplosion and the cries of the boys, rushed in, and perceiving only me\\nand Mr O\\'Gallagher, who still howled, they caught hold of us both, and\\nbore us out in their arms.  It was high time, for the school-room was\\nnow on fire, and in a few minutes more the flames burst out of the\\nwindows, while volumes of smoke forced through the door and soon\\nafterwards the roof.\\n\\nThe engines were sent for, but before they could arrive, or water be\\nprocured, the whole tenement was so enveloped in flames that it could\\nnot be saved.  In an hour, the _locale_ of our misery was reduced to\\nashes.  They had put me on my legs as soon as we got clear of the\\nschool-room, to ascertain whether I was hurt, and finding that I was\\nnot, they left me.\\n\\nI never shall forget what my sensations were, when I beheld the flames\\nand volumes of smoke bursting out; the hurry, and bustle, and confusion\\noutside; the working of the engines, the troops marched up from the\\nbarracks, the crowd of people assembled, and the ceaseless mingling of\\ntongues from every quarter; and all this is my doing, thought I--mine--\\nall mine.\\n\\nI felt delighted that I had no partner or confederate; I could, at all\\nevents, keep my own secret.  I did, however, feel some anxiety as to Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher, for, much as I detested him, I certainly had no intention\\nto kill him; so after a time, I made inquiries, and found that he was\\nalive: and in no danger, although very much bruised and somewhat burnt.\\n\\nNo one could explain how the catastrophe occurred, further than that Mr\\nO\\'Gallagher had collected all the squibs and crackers from the boys, and\\nthat they had exploded somehow or another--most people said that it\\nserved him right.  My grandmother shook her head and said, \"Yes, yes,\\ngunpowder will go off, but--\" and she looked at me--\"it requires a match\\nto be put to it.\"  I looked up very innocently, but made no reply.\\n\\nMr O\\'Gallagher\\'s favourite expression, to wit, \"that it would end in a\\nblow-up,\" proved, as far as his school was concerned, literally true.\\nHe had not the means of procuring another suitable tenement in Chatham,\\nand as soon as he had recovered from the injuries he had received, he\\nquitted the town.\\n\\nIt was not until he had left, that I ventured to make known to Captain\\nBridgeman, and my aunt Milly, the trifling share I had in the\\ntransaction; and they, perceiving the prudence of keeping my secret,\\ndesired me on no account to let it be known to any one else.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE.\\n\\nAs soon as it was ascertained that Mr O\\'Gallagher was gone, my\\ngrandmother insisted upon my being sent to another school, and on this\\noccasion my mother made the inquiries herself, and I was despatched to\\none much nearer home, and being treated well, not only played fewer\\ntricks, but advanced rapidly in my education; so rapidly indeed, that my\\ngrandmother began to think that I was not so bad a boy as I used to be.\\n\\nAs she treated me more kindly, I felt less inclined to teaze her\\nalthough the spirit of mischief was as undiminished as ever, and was\\nshown in various ways.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that out of the many admirers of my aunt\\nMilly, there were only two who appeared to be at all constant in their\\nattention.  One was Lieutenant Flat, who was positively smitten, and\\nwould have laid his pay and person at her feet, had he received anything\\nlike encouragement; but my aunt disliked him in the first place, and,\\nmoreover, had a very strong feeling towards Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nMr Flat was certainly a very fine-looking soldier, being tall, erect,\\nand well-made, but he was at the same time not over-brilliant; he was,\\nas an officer, the very sort of person my father Ben was as a private.\\n\\nBut the other party, Captain Bridgeman, did not come forward; he\\nappeared to be in doubt, and not at all able to make up his mind.\\n\\nThe fact was, that my mother being married to a private, made any match\\nwith the sister objectionable to the whole corps, as it would be\\nderogatory that one sister should be the wife of a private, and the\\nother of an officer.  Ben would have been able to say, \"My\\nbrother-in-law, the captain of my division,\" which would never have\\ndone; and this Captain Bridgeman felt, and therefore resisted, as well\\nas he could, the inroads which my aunt\\'s beauty and mirth had made into\\nhis heart.  My aunt was exactly a person to suit Captain Bridgeman as a\\nhelpmate, had it not been for this unfortunate alliance of my mother\\'s.\\n\\nLieutenant Flat was too stupid and indifferent to the opinion of the\\nother officers, to care anything about what they thought; he would have\\nmarried Milly long before, but my aunt, who had made up her mind to\\nmarry an officer, did not yet despair of obtaining the captain; and\\nalthough she would not positively dismiss Lieutenant Flat, she merely\\nkept him as a sort of reserve, to fall back upon when every other chance\\nwas gone.\\n\\nI should like, if I possibly could, to give the reader some idea of my\\nmother\\'s circulating-library and sort of universal commodity shop: it\\nwas a low-windowed building, one story high, but running a long way\\nback, where it was joined to a small parlour, in which we generally sat\\nduring the day, as it was convenient in case of company or customers,\\nthe little parlour having a glass door, which permitted us to look into\\nthe shop.\\n\\nIn the front windows, on one side, were all the varieties of tapers,\\nsealing-wax, inkstands, and every kind of stationery, backed by\\nchildren\\'s books, leather writing-cases, prints, caricatures, and\\nTonbridge ware.  In the other windows were ribbons, caps, gloves,\\nscarfs, needles, and other little articles in demand by ladies, and\\nwhich they required independent of their milliners.\\n\\nAt the entrance were sticks and canes; on the counter a case of gold and\\nmore moderate-priced trinkets.  On the shelves of the millinery side\\nwere boxes of gloves, ribbons, buttons, etcetera.  On the opposite side,\\nperfumes, cigars, toothbrushes, combs, scented soaps, and other\\nrequisites for the toilet.\\n\\nAbout ten feet on each side of the shop was occupied with the above\\narticles; the remainder of the shelves were reserved for the\\ncirculating-library.\\n\\nAt the back of the shop were some seats round a small table, on which\\nwas laid the newspaper of the day, and on each side of the parlour-door\\nwere hoops, bats, balls, traps, skittles, and a variety of toys for\\nchildren.\\n\\nMy mother usually attended to the millinery, and my aunt Milly to what\\nmight be termed the gentlemen\\'s side of the shop; the remainder of the\\ngoods and circulating-library were in the hands of both.\\n\\nThere were few hours of the day in which the chairs at the counter and\\nround the table were not taken possession of by some one or another,\\neither reading the paper or a book, or talking, to pass away the time.\\nIn fact, it was a sort of rendezvous, where all who met knew each other,\\nand where the idle of our own sex used to repair to get rid of their\\ntime.  Captain Bridgeman and Mr Flat were certainly the two most\\nconstantly to be found there, although few of the marine officers were a\\nday without paying us a visit.\\n\\nSuch was the _locale_; to describe the company will be more difficult,\\nbut I will attempt it.\\n\\nMy mother, remarkably nicely dressed, is busy opening a parcel of new\\nbooks just arrived.  My aunt Milly behind the counter, on the\\ngentlemen\\'s side, pretending to be working upon a piece of muslin about\\nfive inches square.  Mr Flat sitting near the table, fallen back in his\\nchair, apparently watching the flies on the ceiling.  Captain Bridgeman,\\na very good-looking man, very slight, but extremely active, is sitting\\nat the counter opposite to where my aunt is standing, a small black\\ncane, with a silver head to it, in his hand, and his gloves peculiarly\\nclean and well-fitting.  He has an eye as sharp as an eagle\\'s, a slight\\nhook to his nose, thin lips, and very white teeth; his countenance is as\\nfull of energy and fire as that of lieutenant Flat is heavy and\\nunmeaning.\\n\\n\"Miss Amelia, if I may take the liberty,\" said Captain Bridgeman,\\npointing with his cane to the bit of muslin she is employed upon; \"what\\nare you making? it\\'s too small for any part of a lady\\'s dress.\"\\n\\n\"It is quite large enough for a cuff, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"A cuff; then you are making a cuff, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed she is not, Captain Bridgeman,\" replies my mother; \"it is only\\nto keep herself out of mischief.  She spoils a bit like that every week.\\nAnd that\\'s why it is so small, Captain Bridgeman; it would be a pity to\\nspoil a larger piece.\"\\n\\n\"I really was not aware that such a mere trifle would keep you out of\\nmischief,\" said the captain.\\n\\n\"You know,\" replied Aunt Milly, \"that idleness is the root of all evil,\\nCaptain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Flat, do you hear that?\" says Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"What?\" replies Flat.\\n\\n\"That idleness is the root of all evil; what an evil-disposed person you\\nmust be.\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking,\" replied Flat.\\n\\n\"I suspect it\\'s only lately you\\'ve taken to that.  Who or what were you\\nthinking about?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I believe I was thinking how long it would be before dinner was\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very rude, Mr Flat; you might have said that you were thinking\\nabout me,\" replied my aunt.\\n\\n\"Well, so I was at first, and then I began to think of dinner-time.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be offended, Miss Amelia; Flat pays you a great compliment in\\ndividing his attentions; but I really wish to know why ladies will spoil\\nmuslin in such a predetermined manner.  Will you explain that, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Captain Bridgeman: a piece of work is very valuable to a woman,\\nespecially when she finds herself in company with gentlemen like you.\\nIt saves her from looking down, or looking at you, when you are talking\\nnonsense; it prevents your reading in her eyes what is passing in her\\nmind, or discovering what effect your words may have upon her; it saves\\nmuch awkwardness, and very often a blush; sometimes a woman hardly knows\\nwhich way to look; sometimes she may look any way but the right.  Now a\\nbit of muslin with a needle is a remedy for all that, for she can look\\ndown at her work, and not look up till she thinks it advisable.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for your explanation, madam; I shall always take it as a\\ngreat compliment if I see a lady very busy at work when I\\'m conversing,\\nwith her.\"\\n\\n\"But you may flatter yourself, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied my mother;\\n\"the attention to her work may arise from perfect indifference, or from\\npositive annoyance.  It saves the trouble of making an effort to be\\npolite.\"\\n\\n\"And pray, may I inquire, Miss Amelia, what feeling may cause your\\nparticular attention to your work at this present moment?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps in either case to preserve my self-possession,\" replied Amelia;\\n\"or perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, I may prefer looking at a piece of\\nmuslin to looking at a marine officer.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not very flattering,\" replied the captain; \"if you spoil the\\nmuslin, you\\'re determined not to spoil me.\"\\n\\n\"The muslin is of little value,\" said Amelia, softly, walking to the\\nother side of the shop, and turning over the books.\\n\\n\"Mr Flat,\" said my mother, \"your subscription to the library is out\\nlast month; I presume I can put your name down again?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know; I never read a book,\" replied Mr Flat, yawning.\\n\\n\"That\\'s not at all necessary, Mr Flat,\" said my mother; \"in most\\nbusinesses there are sleeping partners; besides, if you don\\'t read, you\\ncome here to talk, which is a greater enjoyment still, and luxuries must\\nbe paid for.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll try another quarter,\" replied Mr Flat, \"and then--\"\\n\\n\"And then what?\" said my aunt Milly, smiling.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" says Flat.  \"Is that clock of yours right, Mrs\\nKeene?\"\\n\\n\"It is; but I am fearful that your thoughts run faster than the clock,\\nMr Flat; you are thinking of the dress-bugle for dinner.\"\\n\\n\"No, I was not.\"\\n\\n\"Then you were thinking of yourself?\"\\n\\n\"No, I wasn\\'t, Mrs Keene,\" said Flat, rising, and walking out of the\\nshop.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" said he, turning round as he went out, \"what I was\\nthinking of, Mrs Keene; not of myself,--I was thinking of my bull pup.\"\\n\\nMy mother burst out a laughing as the lieutenant disappeared.  \"I was\\nnot far wrong when I said he was thinking of himself,\" said she, \"for a\\n_calf_ is a sort of _bull pup_.\"\\n\\nAt this sally Captain Bridgeman laughed, and danced about the shop; at\\nlast he said, \"Poor Flat!  Miss Amelia, he\\'s desperately in love with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s more than I am with him,\" said Amelia, calmly.\\n\\nHere two ladies came in.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman made a most polite bow.  \"I trust Mrs Handbell is\\nquite well and Miss Handbell--I hardly need ask the question with the\\ncharming colour you have?\"\\n\\n\"Captain Bridgeman, you appear to live in this library; I wonder Mrs\\nKeene don\\'t take you into partnership.\"\\n\\n\"If I were not honoured with the custom of Mrs Handbell and other\\nladies; I fear that my shop would have little attraction for gentlemen,\"\\nreplied my mother, with a courtesy.\\n\\n\"Mrs Keene is quite correct in her surmise, Miss Handbell,\" said\\nCaptain Bridgeman, \"now that I have seen you, I shall not think my\\nmorning thrown away.\"\\n\\n\"If report says true, Captain Bridgeman,\" replied Mrs Handbell, \"you\\nwould be quite as often here, even if no ladies were to be customers of\\nMrs Keene.  Mrs Keene, have you any of that narrow French ribbon\\nleft?\"\\n\\n\"I think I have, madam; it was off this piece, was it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but I really don\\'t know exactly how much I require; perhaps you\\nwill measure it and allow me to return what is left?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, madam; will you take it with you, or shall I send it?\"\\n\\n\"I wish for it directly; will you be very long in measuring it, for I\\nought to be home now?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you\\'ll have the kindness to measure what you take off yourself,\\nmadam,\" replied my mother, \"and then you need not wait.\"\\n\\n\"You put confidence in me, I observe, Mrs Keene,\" replied Mrs\\nHandbell; \"well, I will do you justice.\"\\n\\nMy mother smiled most graciously, put the piece of ribbon in paper, and\\nhanded it to Mrs Handbell, who, bowing to Captain Bridgeman, quitted\\nthe shop.\\n\\n\"I wonder whether you would trust me in that way?\" said Captain\\nBridgeman to my mother.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I should; Amelia says you will help yourself to cigars\\nand that she is sure you cheat when you count them.\"\\n\\n\"Does she really say that?  Well, I did think that if there was any one\\nwho would have upheld my character, it would have been Miss Amelia.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps, Captain Bridgeman, she is getting tired of so doing.\"\\n\\n\"Or tired of me, Mrs Keene, which would be worse still.  Here comes a\\nfair young lady--Miss Evans, if I mistake not; I believe she is a good\\ncustomer to your library?\"\\n\\n\"She reads a great deal, and is therefore only a customer to the\\nlibrary.\"\\n\\n\"Ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning Miss Evans,\" said Captain Bridgeman; \"you come for more\\nfood for the mind, I presume?\"  (Miss Evans gave a bob, and turned to my\\nmother.)\\n\\n\"Have you anything new, Mrs Keene?  I have brought back the three\\nvolumes of Godolphin.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, I have some books down to-day.\"\\n\\nWhile Miss Evans was selecting from the new books, enter Mr Jones, Mr\\nSmith, and Mr Claville, of the marine corps, for cigars.  Amelia comes\\nout to attend them--they purchase a few articles, and are talking very\\nloud, when three more ladies enter the shop, all for books.\\n\\nIt being now about three o\\'clock, the customers and loungers come in\\nfast.  Captain Bridgeman saunters away in company with his brother\\nofficers; other parties enter, who are succeeded by fresh claimants for\\nbooks or the other articles to be procured in the repository.\\n\\nThis demand continues till about five o\\'clock, when the library becomes\\nempty; I come home from school, my father slinks in from barracks, and\\nmy mother and sister return to the back parlour, where they find my\\ngrandmother, as usual, very busy with her knitting.\\n\\nSuch is a fair sample of what took place at our shop every succeeding\\nday.  My mother made few bad debts, and rapidly added to her savings.\\nMy aunt Milly still balancing between the certainty of Lieutenant Flat\\nand the chance of Captain Bridgeman, and I dividing my time and talents\\nbetween learning and contriving mischief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN.\\n\\nAbout six months after I had blown up the school of Mr O\\'Gallagher, the\\ncompany to which my father Ben belonged was ordered afloat again, and\\nshortly afterwards sailed for the East Indies, in the Redoubtable, 74.\\nThat my mother was very much pleased at his departure, I do not scruple\\nto assert; but whether she ever analysed her feelings, I cannot pretend\\nto say; I rather think that all she wished was, that the chapter of\\naccidents would prevent Ben\\'s reappearance, as she was ashamed of him as\\na husband, and felt that he was an obstacle to her sister\\'s advancement.\\n\\nSo one fine day Ben wished us all good bye; my mother was very generous\\nto him, as she could well afford to be.  I rather think that Ben himself\\nwas not sorry to go, for, stupid as he was, he must have felt what a\\ncypher he had become, being treated, not only by my mother, but by\\neverybody else, even by me, as a sort of upper servant.\\n\\nIt so happened, that about a month after Ben\\'s departure, Captain Delmar\\nhad, through the interest of his uncle, Lord de Versely, been appointed\\nto a ship which was lying in the Medway, and he came down to Chatham to\\njoin her.  He had no idea that my mother was there, for he had lost\\nsight of her altogether, and had it not been for me, might very probably\\nhave left the town without having made the discovery.\\n\\nAmong other amusements, I had a great partiality for a certain bull pup,\\nmentioned by Lieutenant Flat in the former chapter, and which he had\\nmade me a present of; the pup was now grown up, and I had taught it many\\ntricks; but the one which afforded me most amusement (of course, at\\nother people\\'s expense) was, that I had made out of oakum a sham\\npigtail, about a foot and a half long, very strong and think, with an\\niron hook at the upper end of it.\\n\\nThe sham tail I could easily hook on to the collar of any one\\'s coat\\nfrom behind, without their perceiving it; and Bob had been instructed by\\nme, whenever I told him to fetch it (and not before), to jump up at the\\ntail wherever it might be, and hang on to it with all the tenacity of\\nthe race.\\n\\nAs it may be supposed, this was a great source of mirth in the barracks;\\nit was considered a good joke, and was much applauded by Captain\\nBridgeman; but it was not considered a good joke out of the barracks;\\nand many an old woman had I already frightened almost out of her senses,\\nby affixing the tail to any portion of the back part of her dress.\\n\\nIt so happened, that one afternoon, as I was cruising about with Bob at\\nmy heels, I perceived the newly-arrived Captain Delmar, in all the pomp\\nof pride of full uniform, parading down the street with a little middy\\nat his heels; and I thought to myself, \"Law! how I should like to hang\\nmy tail to his fine coat, if I only dared;\" the impulse had become so\\nstrong, that I actually had pulled up my pinafore and disengaged the\\ntail ready for any opportunity, but I was afraid that the middy would\\nsee me.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had passed close to me, the middy at his heels was\\npassing, and I thought all chance was gone, when, suddenly, Captain\\nDelmar turned short round and addressed the little officer, asking him\\nwhether he had brought the order-book with him?  The middy touched his\\nhat, and said, \"No;\" upon which Captain Delmar began to inflict a most\\nserious lecture upon the lad for forgetting what he had forgotten\\nhimself, and I again passed by.\\n\\nThis was an opportunity I could not resist; while the captain and middy\\nwere so well employed giving and receiving I fixed my oakum tail to the\\ncollar of the Captain\\'s gold-laced coat, and then walked over to the\\nother side of the street with Bob at my heels.\\n\\nThe middy being duly admonished, Captain Delmar turned round again and\\nresumed his way; upon which I called Bob, who was quite as ready for the\\nfun as I was, and pointing to the captain, said, \"Fetch it, Bob.\"  My\\ncompanion cleared the street in three or four bounds, and in a few\\nseconds afterwards made a spring up the back of Captain Delmar, and\\nseizing the tail, hung by it with his teeth, shaking it with all his\\nmight as he hung in the air.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was, to use a sailor\\'s term, completely taken aback;\\nindeed he was nearly capsized by the unexpected assault.  For a short\\ntime he could not discover what it was; at last, by turning his head\\nover his shoulder and putting his hand behind him, he discovered who his\\nassailant was.\\n\\nJust at that time, I called out \"Mad dog! mad dog!\" and Captain Delmar,\\nhearing those alarming words, became dreadfully frightened; his cocked\\nhat dropped from his head, and he took to his heels as fast as he could,\\nrunning down the street, with Bob clinging behind him.\\n\\nThe first open door he perceived was that of my mother\\'s library; he\\nburst in, nearly upsetting Captain Bridgeman, who was seated at the\\ncounter, talking to Aunt Milly, crying out \"Help! help!\"  As he turned\\nround, his sword became entangled between his legs, tripped him up, and\\nhe fell on the floor.  This unhooked the tail, and Bob galloped out of\\nthe shop, bearing his prize to me, who, with the little middy, remained\\nin the street convulsed with laughter.  Bob delivered up the tail, which\\nI again concealed under my pinafore, and then with a demure face\\nventured to walk towards my mother\\'s house, and, going in at the back\\ndoor, put Master Bob in the wash-house out of the way; the little middy\\nwho had picked up the captain\\'s hat, giving me a wink as I passed him,\\nas much as to say, I won\\'t inform against you.\\n\\nIn the meantime Captain Delmar had been assisted to his legs by Captain\\nBridgeman, who well knew who had played the trick, and who, as well as\\nAunt Milly, had great difficulty in controlling his mirth.\\n\\n\"Merciful heaven! what was it?  Was the animal mad?  Has it bitten me?\"\\nexclaimed Captain Delmar, falling back in his chair, in which he had\\nbeen seated by Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\n\"I really do not know,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"but you are not\\nhurt, sir, apparently, nor indeed is your coat torn.\"\\n\\n\"What dog--whose dog can it be?--it must be shot immediately--I shall\\ngive orders--I shall report the case to the admiral.  May I ask for a\\nglass of water?  Oh, Mr Dott! you\\'re there, sir; how came you to allow\\nthat dog to fasten himself on my back in that way?\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" said the middy, presenting his cocked hat to the\\ncaptain, \"I did draw my dirk to kill him, but you ran away so fast that\\nI couldn\\'t catch you.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, sir, you may go down to the boat and wait for orders,\"\\nreplied the captain.\\n\\nAt this moment my mother, who had been dressing herself, made her first\\nappearance, coming out of the back parlour with a glass of water, which\\naunt Milly had gone in for.  Perceiving a gold-laced captain, she\\nadvanced all smiles and courtesies, until she looked in his face, and\\nthen she gave a scream, and dropped the tumbler on the floor, much to\\nthe surprise of Captain Bridgeman, and also of aunt Milly, who, not\\nhaving been at the Hall, was not acquainted with the person of Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nJust at this moment in came I, looking as demure as if, as the saying\\nis, \"butter would not melt in my mouth,\" and certainly as much\\nastonished as the rest at my mother\\'s embarrassment; but she soon\\nrecovered herself, and asked Captain Delmar if he would condescend to\\nrepose himself a little in the back parlour.  When my mother let the\\ntumbler fall, the captain had looked her full in the face and recognised\\nher, and, in a low voice, said, \"Excessively strange,--so very\\nunexpected!\"  He then rose up from the chair and followed my mother into\\nthe back room.\\n\\n\"Who can it be?\" said Aunt Milly to Captain Bridgeman, in a low tone.\\n\\n\"I suppose it must be the new captain appointed to the Calliope.  I read\\nhis name in the papers,--the Honourable Captain Delmar.\"\\n\\n\"It must be him,\" replied Milly; \"for my sister was brought up by his\\naunt, Mrs Delmar; no wonder she was surprised at meeting him so\\nsuddenly.  Percival, you naughty boy,\" continued Milly, shaking her\\nfinger at me, \"it was all your doing.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Aunt Milly! you should have seen him run,\" replied I, laughing at\\nthe thought.\\n\\n\"I\\'d recommend you not to play with post captains,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman, \"or you may get worse than you give.  Mercy on us!\" exclaimed\\nhe, looking at me full in the face.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said aunt Milly.\\n\\nCaptain Bridgeman leant over the counter, and I heard him whisper, \"Did\\nyou ever see such a likeness as between the lad and Captain Delmar?\"\\n\\nMilly blushed a little, nodded her head, and smiled, as she turned away.\\nCaptain Bridgeman appeared to be afterwards in a brown study; he tapped\\nhis boot with his cane, and did not speak.\\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed, during which Captain Delmar remained\\nwith my mother in the parlour, when she opened the door, and beckoned me\\nto come in.  I did so not without some degree of anxiety, for I was\\nafraid that I had been discovered: but this doubt was soon removed;\\nCaptain Delmar did me the honour to shake hands with me, and then patted\\nmy head saying, he hoped I was a good boy, which, being compelled to be\\nmy own trumpeter, I very modestly declared that I was.  My mother, who\\nwas standing up behind, lifted up her eyes at my barefaced assertion.\\nCaptain Delmar then shook hands with my mother, intimating his intention\\nof paying her another visit very soon, and again patting me on the head,\\nquitted the parlour, and went away through the shop.\\n\\nAs soon as Captain Delmar was gone, my mother turned round, and said,\\n\"You naughty, mischievous boy, to play such pranks.  I\\'ll have that dog\\nkilled, without you promise me never to do so again.\"\\n\\n\"Do what again, mother?\"\\n\\n\"None of your pretended innocence with me.  I\\'ve been told of the\\npigtail that Bob pulls at.  That\\'s all very well at the barracks with\\nthe marines, sir, but do you know _who_ it is that you have been playing\\nthat trick to?\"\\n\\n\"No mother, I don\\'t.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"Who is he, you undutiful child? why, he\\'s--he\\'s the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what of that?\" replied I.  \"He\\'s a naval captain, ain\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; but he\\'s the nephew of the lady who brought me up and educated me.\\nIt was he that made the match between me and our father: so if it had\\nnot been for him, child, you never would have been born.\"\\n\\n\"Oh that\\'s it,\" replied I.  \"Well, mother, if it had not been for me,\\nhe\\'d never have come into the shop, and found you.\"\\n\\n\"But, my child, we must be serious; you must be very respectful to\\nCaptain Delmar, and play no tricks with him; for you may see him very\\noften, and, perhaps, he will take a fancy to you; and if he does, he may\\ndo you a great deal of good, and bring you forward in the world; so\\npromise me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, mother, I\\'ll promise you I\\'ll leave him alone if you wish it.\\nLaw, mother, you should have seen how the middy laughed at him; it was\\nreal fun to make a gallant captain run in the way he did.\"\\n\\n\"Go along, you mischievous animal, and recollect your promise to me,\"\\nsaid my mother, as she went into the shop where she found that Captain\\nBridgeman, to whom she intended to explain how it was that she had\\ndropped the tumbler of water, had gone away.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of consultation between my grandmother and my\\nmother on that evening; my aunt and I were sent out to to take a walk,\\nthat we might not overhear what passed, and when we returned we found\\nthem still in close conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\\n\\nThe Honourable Captain Delmar was now a frequent visitor to my mother,\\nand a good customer to the library.  He did, however, generally contrive\\nthat his visit should be paid late in the afternoon, just after the\\nmarine officers had retired to dress for dinner; for he was a very\\nhaughty personage, and did not think it proper for any officers of an\\ninferior grade to come \"between the wind and his nobility.\"\\n\\nI cannot say that I was partial to him; indeed, his pomposity, as I\\nconsidered it, was to me a source of ridicule and dislike.  He took more\\nnotice of me than he did of anybody else; but he appeared to consider\\nthat his condescending patronage was all that was necessary; whereas,\\nhad he occasionally given me a half-crown I should have cherished better\\nfeelings towards him: not that I wanted money, for my mother supplied me\\nvery liberally, considering my age: but although you may coax and\\nflatter a girl into loving you, you cannot a boy, who requires more\\nsubstantial proofs of your good-will.\\n\\nThere were a great many remarks not very flattering to my mother, made\\nbehind her back, as to her former intimacy with Captain Delmar; for,\\nsomehow or another, there always is somebody who knows something,\\nwherever doubts or surmises arise, and so it was in this case; but if\\npeople indulged in ill-natured remarks when she was not there, they did\\nnot in her presence; on the contrary, the friendship of so great a man\\nas the Honourable Captain Delmar appeared rather to make my mother a\\nperson of more consequence.\\n\\nShe was continually pointing out to me the propriety of securing the\\ngood will of this great personage, and the more she did so, the more I\\nfelt inclined to do the reverse; indeed, I should have broke out into\\nopen mutiny, if it had not been for Captain Bridgeman, who sided with my\\nmother, and when I went to him to propose playing another trick upon the\\nnoble captain, not only refused to aid me, but told me, if I ever\\nthought of such a thing, he would never allow me to come to his rooms\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Why, what good can he do to me?\" inquired I.\\n\\n\"He may advance you properly in life--who knows?--he may put you on the\\nquarter-deck, and get you promoted in the service.\"\\n\\n\"What, make a middy of me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and from a midshipman you may rise to be a post-captain, or\\nadmiral,--a much greater rank than I shall ever obtain,\" said Captain\\nBridgeman; \"so take my advice, and do as your mother wishes; be very\\ncivil and respectful to Captain Delmar, and he may be as good as a\\nfather to you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not saying much,\" replied I, thinking of my father Ben; \"I\\'d\\nrather have two mothers than two fathers.\"  And here the conversation\\nended.\\n\\nI had contracted a great alliance with Mr Dott, the midshipman, who\\nfollowed Captain Delmar about, just as Bob used to follow me, and\\ngenerally remained in the shop or outside with me, when his captain\\ncalled upon my mother.  He was a little wag, as full of mischief as\\nmyself, and even his awe of his captain, which, as a youngster in the\\nservice, was excessive, would not prevent him from occasionally breaking\\nout.  My mother took great notice of him, and when he could obtain leave\\n(which, indeed, she often asked for him), invited him to come to our\\nhouse, when he became my companion during his stay; we would sally out\\ntogether, and vie with each other in producing confusion and mirth at\\nother people\\'s expense; we became the abhorrence of every old\\nfruit-woman and beggar in the vicinity.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar heard occasionally of my pranks, and looked very majestic\\nand severe; but as I was not a middy, I cared little for his frowns.  At\\nlast an opportunity offered which I could not resist; and, not daring to\\nmake known my scheme either to Captain Bridgeman or Aunt Milly, I\\nconfided it to Tommy Dott, the little middy, who, regardless of the\\nconsequences, joined me in it heart and soul.\\n\\nThe theatre had been opened at Chatham, and had met with indifferent\\nsuccess.  I went there once with my aunt Milly, and twice with Mr Dott;\\nI, therefore, knew my _locale_ well.  It appeared that one of the female\\nperformers, whose benefit was shortly to take place, was very anxious to\\nobtain the patronage of Captain Delmar, and, with the usual tact of\\nwomen, had applied to my mother in the most obsequious manner,\\nrequesting her to espouse her cause with the gallant captain.\\n\\nMy mother, pleased with the idea of becoming, as it were, a patroness\\nunder the rose, did so effectually exert her influence over the captain,\\nthat, in a day or two afterwards, play-bills were posted all over the\\ntown, announcing that the play of _The Stranger_, with the farce of\\n_Raising the Wind_, would be performed on Friday evening, for the\\nbenefit of Miss Mortimer under the patronage of the Honourable Captain\\nDelmar, and the officers of his Majesty\\'s ship Calliope.  Of course the\\ngrateful young lady sent my mother some tickets of admission, and two of\\nthem I reserved for Tommy Dott and myself.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar had made a large party of ladies, and of course all the\\nofficers of the ship attended: the house was as full as it could hold.\\nMy mother and aunt were there in a retired part of the boxes; Tommy Dott\\nand I entered the theatre with them, and afterwards had gone up to what\\nis, at the theatres at seaports, usually denominated the slips, that is,\\nthe sides of the theatre on the same range as the gallery.  There was\\nCaptain Delmar with all his ladies and all his officers, occupying\\nnearly the whole of the side of the dress circle below us, we having\\ntaken our position above him, so that we might not be observed.\\n\\nThe performance commenced.  Miss Mortimer, as _Mrs Haller_, was very\\neffective; and in the last scene was compelling the eyes of the company\\nto water, when we thought we would produce a still greater effect.\\n\\nWe had purchased a pound of the finest Scotch snuff, which we had\\nenclosed in two pasteboard cases, similar in form to those of squibs,\\nonly about six times the size, and holding half a pound of snuff each.\\nOur object was, in doing this, that, by jerking it all out with a heave,\\nwe might at once throw it right into the centre of the theatre above, so\\nthat in its descent it might be fairly distributed among all parties.\\n\\nThere was no one in the slips with us, except midshipmen, and a\\ndescription of people who would consider it a good joke, and never would\\npeach if they perceived we were the culprits.\\n\\nAt a signal between us, just as _Mrs Haller_ was giving a paper to her\\nhusband did we give our shower of snuff to the audience, jerking it\\nright across the theatre.  In a few minutes the effect was prodigious;\\nCaptain Delmar\\'s party being right beneath us, probably received a\\ngreater share, for they commenced sneezing fast, then the boxes on the\\nother side, the pit followed, and at last _Mr and Mrs Haller_ and the\\n_Stranger_ were taken with such a fit of sneezing that they could no\\nlonger talk to each other.\\n\\nThe children were brought out to their parents to effect their\\nreconciliation, but they did nothing but sneeze, poor things; and at\\nlast the uproar was tremendous, and the curtain was dropped, not to loud\\nplaudits, but to loud sneezings from every part of the theatre.\\n\\nNever was there anything so ludicrous; the manager sent officers up to\\ndiscover the offenders but no one could tell who had played the trick;\\nhe then came before the curtain to make a speech upon the occasion, but,\\nhaving sneezed seven or eight times, he was obliged to retire with his\\nhandkerchief to his nose; and the audience, finding it impossible to\\ncheck the titillation of the olfactory nerves, abandoned the theatre as\\nfast as they could, leaving the farce of _Raising the Wind_ to be\\nperformed to empty beaches.\\n\\nI hardly need say, that as soon as we had thrown the snuff, Mr Dott and\\nI had gone down and taken our places very demurely in the box by the\\nside of my mother, and appeared just as astonished, and indeed added as\\nmuch as possible to the company of sneezers.\\n\\nCaptain Delmar was very furious at this want of respect of certain\\nparties unknown, and had we been discovered, whatever might have been my\\nfate, it would have gone hard with Tommy Dott; but we kept our own\\ncounsel, and escaped.\\n\\nThat I was suspected by Aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman is certain, and\\nmy aunt taxed me with it, but I would not confess; my mother also had\\nher suspicions, but as Captain Delmar had none, that was of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nThe success of this trick was a great temptation to try another or two\\nupon the noble captain.  He was, however saved by the simple fact of\\nH.M. ship Calliope being reported manned and ready for sea; orders were\\nsent down for his going round to Portsmouth to await the commands of the\\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and Captain Delmar came to pay his\\nfarewell visit.\\n\\nThe report from the schoolmaster had been very favourable and Captain\\nDelmar then asked me, for the first time, if I would like to be a\\nsailor.  As Captain Bridgeman had advised me not to reject any good\\noffer on the part of the honourable captain, I answered in the\\naffirmative; whereupon the captain replied, that if I paid attention to\\nmy learning, in a year\\'s time he would take me with him on board of his\\nfrigate.\\n\\nHe then patted my head, forgot to give me half a crown, and, shaking\\nhands with my mother and aunt, quitted the house, followed by Tommy\\nDott, who, as he went away, turned and laughed his adieu.\\n\\nI have not mentioned my grandmother lately.  The fact is, that when\\nCaptain Delmar made his appearance, for some cause or another, which I\\ncould not comprehend, she declared her intention of going away and\\npaying a visit to her old acquaintances at the Hall.  She did so.  As I\\nafterwards found out from what I overheard, she had a very great\\naversion to the noble captain: but the cause of her aversion was never\\ncommunicated to me.  Soon after the sailing of the Calliope, she again\\nmade her appearance, took her old seat in the easy-chair, and resumed\\nher eternal knitting as before.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\\n\\nAnother year of my existence passed rapidly away; I was nearly thirteen\\nyears old, a sturdy bold boy, well fitted for the naval profession,\\nwhich I now considered decided upon, and began to be impatient to leave\\nschool, and wondered that we heard nothing of Captain Delmar, when news\\nwas received from another quarter.\\n\\nOne morning Captain Bridgeman came much earlier than usual, and with a\\nvery grave face put on especially for the occasion.  I had not set off\\nfor school, and ran up to him; but he checked me, and said, \"I must see\\nyour mother directly, I have very important news for her.\"\\n\\nI went in to tell my mother, who requested Captain Bridgeman to come\\ninto the parlour, and not being aware of the nature of the\\ncommunication, ordered Aunt Milly and me into the shop; we waited for\\nsome minutes, and then Captain Bridgeman made his appearance.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"Read this newspaper,\" said he; \"there is a despatch from India, it will\\ntell you all about it, and you can show it to your sister, when she is\\nmore composed.\"\\n\\nCurious to know what the matter could be, I quitted the shop, and went\\ninto the parlour, where I saw my mother with her face buried in the sofa\\npillow, and apparently in great distress.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, mother?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh! my child, my child!\" replied my mother, wringing her hands, \"you\\nare an orphan, and I am a lonely widow.\"\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"How\\'s that?\" said my grandmother, \"why, are you such a fool, as not to\\nunderstand that your father is dead?\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead, is he?\" replied I, \"I\\'ll go and tell Aunt Milly;\" and\\naway I went out of the parlour to Milly, whom I found reading the\\nnewspaper.\\n\\n\"Aunt,\" said I, \"father\\'s dead, only to think!  I wonder how he died!\"\\n\\n\"He was killed in action, dear,\" said my aunt; \"look here, here is the\\naccount, and the list of killed and wounded.  D\\'ye see your father\\'s\\nname--Benjamin Keene, marine?\"\\n\\n\"Let me read all about it, Aunt Milly,\" replied I, taking the paper from\\nher; and I was soon very busy with the account of the action.\\n\\nMy readers must not suppose that I had no feeling, because I showed none\\nat my father\\'s death; if they call to mind the humble position in which\\nI had always seen my father, who dared not even intrude upon the\\npresence of those with whom my mother and I were on familiar terms, and\\nthat he was ordered about just like a servant by my mother, who set me\\nno example of fear or love for him, they will easily imagine that I felt\\nless for his death than I should have for that of Captain Bridgeman, or\\nmany others with whom I was on intimate terms.\\n\\nWhat did puzzle me was, that my mother should show so much feeling on\\nthe occasion.  I did not know the world then, and that decency required\\na certain display of grief.  Aunt Milly appeared to be very unconcerned\\nabout it, although, occasionally, she was in deep thought.  I put down\\nthe paper as soon as I had read the despatch, and said to her, \"Well, I\\nsuppose I must go to school now, aunt?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, dear,\" replied she, \"you can\\'t go to school for a few days now--\\nit wouldn\\'t be proper; you must remain at home and wait till you have\\nput on mourning.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of that, at all events,\" replied I; \"I wonder where Captain\\nDelmar is, and why he don\\'t send for me; I begin to hate school.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say it won\\'t be long before you hear from him, dear,\" replied my\\naunt; \"stay here and mind the shop, while I go in to your mother.\"\\n\\nIf the truth was told, I am afraid that the death of Ben was a source of\\ncongratulation to all parties who were then in the parlour.  As for me,\\nI was very glad to have a few days\\' holiday, being perfectly indifferent\\nas to whether he was dead or alive.\\n\\nWhen I went in I found them in consultation as to the mourning: my\\nmother did not, in the first place, wish to make any a parade about a\\nhusband of whom she was ashamed; in the second, she did not like widow\\'s\\nweeds, and the unbecoming cap.  So it was decided, as Ben had been dead\\nsix months, and if they had known it before they would have been in\\nmourning for him all that time, that half-mourning was all that was\\nrequisite for them; and that, as for me, there was no reason for my\\ngoing into mourning at all.\\n\\nThree days after the intelligence, my mother re-appeared in the shop;\\nthe reason why she did not appear before was, that her dress was not\\nready--she looked very pretty indeed in half-mourning, so did my Aunt\\nMilly; and the attentions of the marine corps, especially Captain\\nBridgeman and Lieutenant Flat, were more unremitting than ever.\\n\\nIt appeared that, as the death of Ben had removed the great difficulty\\nto my aunt\\'s being married to an officer, my grandmother had resolved to\\nascertain the intentions of Captain Bridgeman, and if she found that he\\ncried off, to persuade Milly to consent to become Mrs Flat.  Whether\\nshe consulted my mother or my aunt on this occasion, I cannot positively\\nsay, but I rather think not.\\n\\nMy mother and my aunt were walking out one evening, when Captain\\nBridgeman came in, and my grandmother, who remained in the shop whenever\\nmy mother and Milly went out together, which was very seldom, requested\\nhim to walk into the back parlour, desiring me to remain in the shop,\\nand let her know if she was wanted.\\n\\nNow when they went into the parlour, the door was left ajar, and, as I\\nremained at the back part of the shop, I could not help over-hearing\\nevery word which was said; for my grandmother being very deaf, as most\\ndeaf people do, talked quite as loud as Captain Bridgeman was compelled\\nto do, to make her hear him.\\n\\n\"I wish, Captain Bridgeman, as a friend, to ask your advice relative to\\nmy daughter Amelia,\" said the old lady.  \"Please to take a chair.\"\\n\\n\"If there is any opinion that I can offer on the subject, madam, I shall\\nbe most happy to give it,\" replied the captain, sitting down as\\nrequested.\\n\\n\"You see, my daughter Amelia has been well brought up, and carefully\\neducated, as was, indeed, my daughter, Arabella, through the kindness of\\nmy old patron, Mrs Delmar, the aunt of the Honourable Captain Delmar,\\nwhom you have often met here, and who is heir to the title of de\\nVersely; that is to say, his eldest brother has no children.  I have\\nbeen nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential, Captain\\nBridgeman; the old lord was very fond of my husband, who was his\\nsteward, but he died, poor man, a long while ago; I am sure it would\\nhave broken his heart, if, in his lifetime, my daughter Arabella had\\nmade the foolish marriage which she did with a private marine--however,\\nwhat\\'s done can\\'t be helped, as the saying is--that\\'s all over now.\"\\n\\n\"It was certainly a great pity that Mrs Keene should have been so\\nfoolish,\" replied Captain Bridgeman, \"but, as you say, that is all over\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; God\\'s will be done, Captain Bridgeman; now you see, sir, that this\\nmarriage of Bella\\'s has done no good to the prospects of her sister\\nAmelia, who, nevertheless, is a good and pretty girl though I say it,\\nwho am her mother; and moreover, she will bring a pretty penny to her\\nhusband whoever he may be; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, my husband\\nwas not idle during the time that he was in the family of the Delmars,\\nand as her sister is so well to do, why little Amelia will come into a\\ngreater share than she otherwise would--that is, if she marries well,\\nand according to the wishes of her mother.\"\\n\\nAt this interesting part of the conversation Captain Bridgeman leant\\nmore earnestly towards my grandmother.\\n\\n\"A pretty penny, madam, you said; I never heard the expression before;\\nwhat may a pretty penny mean?\"\\n\\n\"It means, first and last, 4,000 pounds, Captain Bridgeman; part down,\\nand the other when I die.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Captain Bridgeman; \"I certainly never thought that\\nMiss Amelia would ever have any fortune; indeed, she\\'s too pretty and\\naccomplished to require any.\"\\n\\n\"Now, sir,\" continued my grandmother, \"the point on which I wish to\\nconsult you is this: you know that Lieutenant Flat is very often here,\\nand for a long while has been very attentive to my daughter; he has, I\\nbelieve, almost as much as proposed--that is, in his sort of way; but my\\ndaughter does not seem to care for him.  Now, Captain Bridgeman, Mr\\nFlat may not be very clever, but I believe him to be a very worthy young\\nman; still one must be cautious, and what I wish to know before I\\ninterfere and persuade my daughter to marry him is, whether you think\\nthat Mr Flat is of a disposition which would make the marriage state a\\nhappy one; for you see, Captain Bridgeman, love before marriage is very\\napt to fly away, but love that comes after marriage will last out your\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Well, madam,\" replied the captain, \"I will be candid with you; I do not\\nthink that a clever girl like Miss Amelia is likely to be happy as the\\nwife of my good friend Mr Flat--still there is nothing against his\\ncharacter, madam; I believe him harmless--very harmless.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a very fine-looking young man, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nothing to be found fault with in his appearance.\"\\n\\n\"Very good-natured.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; he\\'s not very quick in temper, or anything else; he\\'s what we call\\na slow-coach.\"\\n\\n\"I hear he\\'s a very correct officer, Captain Bridgeman.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I am not aware that he has ever been under an arrest.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we cannot expect everything in this world; he is handsome,\\ngood-tempered, and a good officer--I cannot see why Amelia does not like\\nhim, particularly as her affections are not otherwise engaged.  I am\\nsatisfied with the answer you have given, Captain Bridgeman, and now I\\nshall point out to Amelia that I expect she will make up her mind to\\naccept Mr Flat.\"\\n\\nHere Captain Bridgeman hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam, if her affections are not otherwise engaged--I say--are\\nnot engaged, madam, I do not think she could do better.  Would, you like\\nme to sound Miss Amelia on the subject?\"\\n\\n\"Really, Captain Bridgeman, it is very kind of you; you may, perhaps,\\npersuade her to listen to your friend Mr Flat.\"\\n\\n\"I will, at all events, ascertain her real sentiments, madam,\" said the\\ncaptain, rising; \"and, if you please, I will say farewell for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nAs my grandmother anticipated, the scale, which had been so long\\nbalanced by Captain Bridgeman, was weighed down in favour of marriage by\\nthe death of my father Ben, and the unexpected fortune of 4,000 pounds.\\n\\nThe next day the captain proposed and was accepted, and six weeks from\\nthat date my aunt Milly became his wife.\\n\\nThe wedding was very gay: some people did sneer at the match, but where\\nwas there ever a match without a sneer?  There are always and everywhere\\npeople to be found who will envy the happiness of others.  Some talked\\nabout the private marine; this attack was met with the 4,000 pounds (or\\nrather 8,000 pounds per annum, for rumour, as usual, had doubled the\\nsum); others talked of the shop as _infra dig_; the set-off against\\nwhich was, the education and beauty of the bride.  One or two subs\\'\\nwives declared that they would not visit Mrs Bridgeman; but when the\\ncolonel and his lady called to congratulate the new-married couple, and\\ninvited a large party in their own house to meet them, then then subs\\'\\nwives left their cards as soon as they could.\\n\\nIn a few weeks all was right again: my mother would not give up her\\nshop--it was too lucrative; but she was on more intimate terms with her\\ncustomers; and when people found that, although her sister was a\\ncaptain\\'s lady, my mother had too much sense to be ashamed of her\\nposition; why they liked her the better.  Indeed, as she was still very\\nhandsome, one or two of the marine officers, now that she was a widow,\\npaid her very assiduous court; but my mother had no intention of\\nentering again into the holy state--she preferred STATE _in quo_.  She\\nhad no one to care for but me, and for me she continued her shop and\\nlibrary, although, I believe, she could have retired upon a comfortable\\nindependence, had she chosen so to do.\\n\\nMy mother, whatever she might have been when a girl, was now a\\nstrong-minded, clever woman.  It must have been a painful thing for her\\nto have made up her mind to allow me to go to sea; I was her only child,\\nher only care; I believe she loved me dearly, although she was not so\\nlavish of her caresses as my aunt Milly; but she perceived that it would\\nbe for my advantage that I should insure the patronage and protection of\\nCaptain Delmar, and she sacrificed self to my interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\\n\\nAbout a month after my aunt\\'s marriage, a letter was received from\\nCaptain Delmar, who had arrived at Spithead, requesting my mother to\\nsend me to Portsmouth as soon as she could, and not go to the trouble or\\nexpense of fitting me out, as he would take that upon himself.\\n\\nThis was but short notice to give a fond mother, but there was no help\\nfor it; she returned an answer, that in three days from the date of the\\nletter I should be there.\\n\\nI was immediately summoned from school that she might see as much of me\\nas possible before I went; and although she did not attempt to detain\\nme, I perceived, very often, the tears run down her cheeks.\\n\\nMy grandmother thought proper to make me very long speeches every three\\nor four hours, the substance of which may be comprehended in very few\\nwords--to wit, that I had been a very bad boy, and that I was little\\nbetter now; that I had been spoiled by over-indulgence, and that it was\\nlucky my aunt Milly was not so much with me; that on board a man-of-war\\nI dare not play tricks, and that I would find it very different from\\nbeing at home with my mother; that Captain Delmar was a very great man,\\nand that I must be very respectful to him; that some day I should thank\\nher very much for her being so kind to me; that she hoped I would behave\\nwell, and that if I did not, she hoped that I would get a good beating.\\n\\nSuch was the burden of her song, till at last I got very tired of it,\\nand on the third evening I broke away from her, saying, \"Law, granny how\\nyou do twaddle!\" upon which she called me a good-for-nothing young\\nblackguard, and felt positively sure that I should be hanged.  The\\nconsequence was, that granny and I did not part good friends; and I\\nsincerely hoped that when I had come back again, I should not find her\\nabove ground.\\n\\nThe next morning I bade farewell to my dear Aunt Milly and Captain\\nBridgeman, received a very ungracious salute from granny, who appeared\\nto think, as she kissed me, that her lips were touching something\\npoisonous, and set off with my mother in the coach to Portsmouth.\\n\\nWe arrived safe at Portsmouth, and my mother immediately took lodgings\\non the Common Hard at Portsea.  The next day, having dressed herself\\nwith great care, with a very thick veil on her bonnet, my mother walked\\nwith me to the George Hotel, where Captain Delmar had taken up his\\nquarters.\\n\\nOn my mother sending up her card, we were immediately ushered upstairs,\\nand on entering the room found the Honourable Captain Delmar sitting\\ndown in full uniform--his sword, and hat, and numerous papers, lying on\\nthe table before him.  On one side of the table stood a lieutenant, hat\\nin hand; on the other, the captain\\'s clerk, with papers for him to sign.\\nMy friend Tommy Dott was standing at the window, chasing a blue-bottle\\nfly, for want of something better to do; and the steward was waiting for\\norders behind the captain\\'s chair.\\n\\nMy mother, who had pulled down her veil, so that her face was not\\nvisible, made a slight courtesy to Captain Delmar, who rose up and\\nadvanced to receive her very graciously, requesting that she would be\\nseated for a minute or two, till he had time to speak to her.\\n\\nI have thought since, that my honourable captain had a mind to impress\\nupon my mother the state and dignity of a captain in his Majesty\\'s\\nservice, when in commission.  He took no notice whatever of me.  Tommy\\nDott gave me a wink of his eye from the window, and I returned the\\ncompliment by putting my tongue into my cheek; but the other parties\\nwere too much occupied with the captain to perceive our friendly\\nrecognition.  Captain Delmar continued to give various orders, and after\\na time the officers attending were dismissed.\\n\\nAs soon as we were alone, my mother was addressed in, I thought, rather\\na pompous way, and very much in contrast with his previous politeness\\nbefore others.  Captain Delmar informed her that he should take me\\nimmediately under his protection, pay all my expenses, and, if I behaved\\nwell, advance me in the service.\\n\\nAt this announcement, my mother expressed a great deal of gratitude,\\nand, shedding a few tears, said, that the boy would in future look up to\\nhim as a parent.  To this speech Captain Delmar made no reply; but,\\nchanging the conversation, told her that he expected to sail in about\\nthree or four days, and that no time must be lost in fitting me out;\\nthat, all things considered, he thought it advisable that she should\\nreturn at once to Chatham, and leave the boy with him as she could not\\nknow what was requisite for me, and would therefore be of no use.\\n\\nAt the idea of parting with me, my mother cried bitterly.  Captain\\nDelmar did then rise off his chair, and taking my mother by the hand\\nspeak to her a few words of consolation.  My mother removed her\\nhandkerchief from her eyes and sighed deeply, saying to Captain Delmar,\\nwith an appealing look, \"Oh!  Captain Delmar, remember that for you I\\nhave indeed made great sacrifices; do not forget them, when you look at\\nthat boy, who is very dear to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will do him justice,\" replied the captain, somewhat affected, \"but I\\nmust insist upon inviolable secrecy on your part; you must promise me\\nthat under any circumstances--\"\\n\\n\"I have obeyed you for thirteen years,\" replied my mother; \"I am not\\nlikely to forget my promise now; it is hard to part with him, but I\\nleave him in the hands of--\"\\n\\n\"You forget the boy is there,\" interrupted Captain Delmar; \"take him\\naway now; to-morrow morning I will send my coxswain for him, and you\\nmust go back to Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"God bless you, sir,\" replied my mother, weeping, as Captain Delmar\\nshook her hand, and then we left the room.  As we were walking back to\\nour lodging, I inquired of my mother--\"What\\'s the secret between you and\\nCaptain Delmar, mother?\"\\n\\n\"The secret, child!  Oh, something which took place at the time I was\\nliving with his aunt, and which he does not wish to have known; so ask\\nme no more questions about it.\"\\n\\nAfter our return, my mother gave me a great deal of advice.  She told me\\nthat, as I had lost my father Ben, I must now look upon Captain Delmar\\nas a father to me; that Ben had been a faithful servant to the captain,\\nand that she had been the same to Mrs Delmar, his aunt; and that was\\nthe reason why Captain Delmar was interested about me, and had promised\\nto do so much for me; begging me to treat him with great respect and\\nnever venture to play him any tricks, or otherwise he would be highly\\noffended, and send me home again; and then I should never rise to be an\\nofficer in his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\nI cannot say the advice received the attention it deserved, for I felt\\nmore inclined to play tricks to my honourable captain than any person I\\never met with; however, I appeared to consent, and, in return begged my\\nmother to take care of my dog Bob, which she promised to do.\\n\\nMy mother cried a great deal during the night; the next morning she gave\\nme five guineas as pocket-money, recommending me to be careful of it,\\nand telling me I must look to Captain Delmar for my future supply.  She\\ntied up the little linen I had brought with me in a handkerchief, and\\nshortly after the coxswain knocked at the door, and came upstairs to\\nclaim me for his Majesty\\'s service.\\n\\n\"I\\'m come for the youngster, if you please, marm,\" said the coxswain, a\\nfine, tall seaman, remarkably clean and neat in his dress.\\n\\nMy mother put her arms round me, and burst into tears.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, marm,\" said the coxswain, after standing silent\\nabout a minute, \"but could not you _do the piping_ after the youngster\\'s\\ngone?  If I stay here long I shall be blowed up by the skipper, as sure\\nas my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\n\"I will detain you but a few seconds longer,\" replied my mother; \"I may\\nnever see him again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s a fact; my poor mother never did me,\" replied the\\ncoxswain.\\n\\nThis observation did not raise my mother\\'s spirits.  Another pause\\nensued, during which I was bedewed with her tears, when the coxswain\\napproached again--\\n\\n\"I ax your pardon, marm; but if you know anything of Captain Delmar, you\\nmust know he\\'s not a man to be played with, and you would not wish to\\nget me into trouble.  It\\'s a hard thing to part with a child, I\\'m told,\\nbut it wouldn\\'t help me if I said anything about your tears.  If the\\ncaptain were to go to the boat, and find me not there, he\\'d just say,\\n`What were my orders, sir?\\' and after that, you know, marm, there is not\\na word for me to say.\"\\n\\n\"Take him, then, my good man,\" replied my mother, pressing me\\nconvulsively to her heart--\"take him; Heaven bless you, my dear child.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kind of you,\" replied the coxswain.  \"Come, my\\nlittle fellow, we\\'ll soon make a man of you.\"\\n\\nI once more pressed my lips to my poor mother\\'s, and she resigned me to\\nthe coxswain, at the same time taking some silver off the table and\\nputting it into his hand.\\n\\n\"Thanky, marm; that\\'s kinder still, to think of another when you\\'re in\\ndistress yourself; I shan\\'t forget it.  I\\'ll look after the lad a bit\\nfor you, as sure as my name\\'s Bob Cross.\"\\n\\nMy mother sank down on the sofa, with her handkerchief to her eyes.\\n\\nBob Cross caught up the bundle, and led me away.  I was very melancholy,\\nfor I loved my mother, and could not bear to see her so distressed, and\\nfor some time we walked on without speaking.\\n\\nThe coxswain first broke the silence:--\"What\\'s your name, my little\\nTrojan?\" said he.\\n\\n\"Percival Keene.\"\\n\\n\"Well I\\'m blessed if I didn\\'t think that you were one of the Delmar\\nbreed, by the cut of your jib; howsomever, it\\'s a wise child that knows\\nits own father.\"\\n\\n\"Father\\'s dead,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Dead!  Well, fathers do die sometimes; you must get on how you can\\nwithout one.  I don\\'t think fathers are of much use, for, you see,\\nmothers take care of you till you\\'re old enough to go to sea.  My father\\ndid nothing for me, except to help mother to lick me, when I was\\nobstropolous.\"\\n\\nThe reader, from what he has already been informed about Ben, the\\nmarine, may easily conceive that I was very much of Bob Cross\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\"I suppose you don\\'t know anybody on board--do you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know Tommy Dott--I knew him when the ship was at Chatham.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!  Mr Tommy Dott; I dare say you\\'re just like him, for you look full\\nof mischief.  He\\'s a very nice young man for a small party, as the\\nsaying is; there is more devil in his little carcase than in two\\nwomen\\'s, and that\\'s not a trifle; you\\'ll hunt in couples, I dare say,\\nand get well flogged at the same gun, if you don\\'t take care.  Now, here\\nwe are, and I must report my arrival with you under convoy.\"\\n\\nBob Cross sent a waiter for the captain\\'s steward, who went up to\\nCaptain Delmar.  I was ordered to go upstairs, and again found myself in\\nthe presence of the noble captain, and a very stout elderly man, with a\\nflaxen wig.\\n\\n\"This is the lad,\" said Captain Delmar, when I came into the room and\\nwalked up to him; \"you know exactly what he requires; oblige me by\\nseeing him properly fitted out and the bill sent in to me.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" said the old\\ngentleman, with a profound bow.\\n\\n\"You had better not order too many things, as he is growing fast; it\\nwill be easy to make good any deficiencies as they may be required.\"\\n\\n\"Your orders shall be most strictly obeyed, Captain Delmar,\" replied the\\nold gentleman, with another bow.\\n\\n\"I hardly know what to do with him for to-day and to-morrow, until his\\nuniforms are made,\" continued the captain: \"I suppose he must go on\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"If you have no objection, Captain Delmar,\" said the old gentleman, with\\nanother low bow, \"I am sure that Mrs Culpepper will be most proud to\\ntake charge of any _protege_ of yours; we have a spare bed, and the\\nyoung gentleman can remain with us until he is ready to embark in the\\nuniform of his rank.\"\\n\\n\"Be it so, Mr Culpepper; let your wife take care of him until all is\\ncomplete, and his chest is ready.  You\\'ll oblige me by arranging about\\nhis mess.\"\\n\\n\"Your wishes shall be most strictly attended to, Captain Delmar,\"\\nreplied Mr Culpepper, with another profound inclination, which made me\\nfeel very much inclined to laugh.\\n\\n\"If you have no further orders, Captain Delmar, I will now take the\\nyoung gentleman with me.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more, Mr Culpepper--good morning,\" replied Captain Delmar, who\\nneither said how d\\'ye do to me when I came in, or good bye when I went\\naway in company with Mr Culpepper.  I had yet to learn what a thing of\\nno consequence was a \"sucking Nelson.\"\\n\\nI followed Mr Culpepper down stairs, who desired me to remain with the\\ncoxswain, who was standing under the archway, while he spoke to the\\ncaptain\\'s steward.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob Cross, \"what\\'s the ticket, youngster,--are you to go\\nabroad with me?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I; \"I am to stay on shore with that old chap, who does\\nnothing but bob his head up and down.  Who is he?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s our nipcheese.\"\\n\\n\"Nipcheese!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; nipcheese means purser of the ship--you\\'ll find all that out\\nby-and-by; you\\'ve got lots to larn, and, by way of a hint, make him your\\nfriend if you can, for he earwigs the captain in fine style.\"\\n\\nPerceiving that I did not understand him, Bob Cross continued: \"I mean\\nthat our captain\\'s very fond of the officers paying him great respect,\\nand he likes all that bowing and scraping; he don\\'t like officers or men\\nto touch their hats, but to take them right off their heads when they\\nspeak to him.  You see, he\\'s a sprig of nobility, as they call it, and\\nwhat\\'s more he\\'s also a post-captain, and thinks no small beer of\\nhimself; so don\\'t forget what I say--here comes the purser.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper now came out, and, taking my hand, led me away to his own\\nhouse, which was at Southsea.  He did not speak a word during the walk,\\nbut appeared to be in deep cogitation: at last we arrived at his door.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\\n\\nWhy is it that I detain the reader with Mr Culpepper and his family?  I\\ndon\\'t know, but I certainly have an inclination to linger over every\\nlittle detail of events which occurred upon my first plunging into the\\nsea of life, just as naked boys on the New River side stand shivering a\\nwhile, before they can make up their minds to dash into the unnatural\\nelement; for men are not ducks, although they do show some affinity to\\ngeese by their venturing upon the treacherous fluid.\\n\\nThe door was opened, and I found myself in the presence of Mrs\\nCulpepper and her daughter,--the heiress, as I afterwards discovered, to\\nall Mr Culpepper\\'s savings, which were asserted to be something\\nconsiderable after thirty years\\' employment as purser of various vessels\\nbelonging to his Majesty.\\n\\nMrs Culpepper was in person enormous--she looked like a feather-bed\\nstanding on end; her cheeks were as large as a dinner-plate, eyes almost\\nas imperceptible as a mole\\'s, nose just visible, mouth like a round O.\\nIt was said that she was once a great Devonshire beauty.  Time, who has\\nbeen denominated _Edax rerum_, certainly had as yet left her untouched,\\nreserving her for a _bonne bouche_ on some future occasion.\\n\\nShe sat in a very large arm-chair--indeed, no common-sized chair could\\nhave received her capacious person.  She did not get up when I entered;\\nindeed, as I discovered, she made but two attempts to stand during the\\ntwenty-four hours; one was to come out of her bedroom, which was on the\\nsame floor as the parlour, and the other to go in again.\\n\\nMiss Culpepper was somewhat of her mother\\'s build.  She might have been\\ntwenty years old, and was, for a girl of her age, exuberantly fat; yet\\nas her skin and complexion were not coarse, many thought her handsome;\\nbut she promised to be as large as her mother, and certainly was not at\\nall suited for a wife to a subaltern of a marching regiment.\\n\\n\"Who have we here?\" said Mrs Culpepper to her husband, in a sort of low\\ncroak; for she was so smothered with fat that she could not get her\\nvoice out.\\n\\n\"Well, I hardly know,\" replied the gentleman, wiping his forehead; \"but\\nI\\'ve my own opinion.\"\\n\\n\"Mercy on me, how very like!\" exclaimed Miss Culpepper, looking at me,\\nand then at her father.  \"Would not you like to go into the garden,\\nlittle boy?\" continued she: \"there, through the passage, out of the\\ndoor,--you can\\'t miss it.\"\\n\\nAs this was almost a command, I did not refuse to go; but as soon as I\\nwas in the garden, which was a small patch of ground behind the house,\\nas the window to the parlour was open, and my curiosity was excited by\\ntheir evidently wishing to say something which they did not wish me to\\nhear, I stopped under the window and listened.\\n\\n\"The very picture of him,\" continued the young lady.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, very like indeed,\" croaked the old one.\\n\\n\"All I know is,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"Captain Delmar has desired me to\\nfit him out, and that he pays all the expenses.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s another proof,\" said the young lady; \"he wouldn\\'t pay for\\nother people\\'s children.\"\\n\\n\"He was brought down here by a very respectable-looking, I may say\\ninteresting, and rather pretty woman,--I should think about thirty.\"\\n\\n\"Then she must have been handsome when this boy was born,\" replied the\\nyoung lady: \"I consider that another proof.  Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"Went away this morning by the day-coach, leaving the boy with the\\ncaptain, who sent his coxswain for him.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s mystery about that,\" rejoined the daughter, \"and therefore I\\nconsider it another proof.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Culpepper, \"and a strong one too.  Captain Delmar is so\\nhigh and mighty, that he would not have it thought that he could ever\\ncondescend to have an intrigue with one beneath him in rank and station,\\nand he has sent her away on that account, depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"Just so; and if that boy is not a son of Captain Delmar, I\\'m not a\\nwoman.\"\\n\\n\"I am of that opinion,\" replied the father, \"and therefore I offered to\\ntake charge of him, as the captain did not know what to do with him till\\nhis uniform was ready.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied Miss Culpepper, \"I\\'ll soon find out more.  I\\'ll pump\\neverything that he knows out of him before he leaves us; I know how to\\nput that and that together.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" croaked the fat mother; \"Medea knows how to put that and that\\ntogether, as well as any one.\"\\n\\n\"You must be very civil and very kind to him,\" said Mr Culpepper; \"for\\ndepend upon it, the very circumstance of the captain\\'s being compelled\\nto keep the boy at a distance will make him feel more fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no patience with the men in that respect,\" observed the young\\nlady: \"how nobility can so demean themselves I can\\'t think; no wonder\\nthey are ashamed of what they have done, and will not acknowledge their\\nown offspring.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"If a woman has the misfortune to yield to her inclinations, they don\\'t\\nlet her off so easily,\" exclaimed Miss Medea.\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" croaked the mamma again.\\n\\n\"Men make the laws and break them,\" continued Miss Culpepper.  \"Mere\\nbrute strength, even in the most civilised society.  If all women had\\nonly the spirit that I have, there would be a little alteration, and\\nmore justice.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t pretend to argue with you, Medea,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"I\\ntake the world as I find it, and make the best of it.  I must go now,--\\nmy steward is waiting for me at the victualling office.  Just brush my\\nhat a little, Medea, the wind has raised the nap, and then I\\'ll be off.\"\\n\\nI walked very softly from the window; a new light had burst upon me.\\nYoung as I was, I also could put that and that together.  I called to\\nmind the conduct of my mother towards her husband Ben; the dislike of my\\ngrandmother to Captain Delmar; the occasional conversations I had\\noverheard; the question of my mother checked before it was finished--\"If\\nI knew who it was that I had been playing the trick to;\" the visits my\\nmother received from Captain Delmar, who was so haughty and distant to\\neverybody; his promise to provide for me, and my mother\\'s injunctions to\\nme to be obedient and look up to him as a father, and the remarks of the\\ncoxswain, Bob Cross,--\"If I were not of the Delmar breed:\" all this,\\nadded to what I had just overheard, satisfied me that they were not\\nwrong in their conjectures, and that I really was the son of the\\nhonourable captain.\\n\\nMy mother had gone; I would have given worlds to have gained this\\ninformation before, that I might have questioned her, and obtained the\\ntruth from her; but that was now impossible, and I felt convinced that\\nwriting was of no use.  I recollected the conversation between her and\\nthe Captain, in which she promised to keep the secret, and the answer\\nshe gave me when I questioned her; nothing, then, but my tears and\\nentreaties could have any effect, and those, I knew, were powerful over\\nher; neither would it be of any use to ask Aunt Milly, for she would not\\ntell her sister\\'s secrets, so I resolved to say nothing about it for the\\npresent; and I did not forget that Mr Culpepper had said that Captain\\nDelmar would be annoyed if it was supposed that I was his son; I\\nresolved, therefore, that I would not let him imagine that I knew\\nanything about it, or had any idea of it.\\n\\nI remained more than an hour in deep thought, and it was strange what a\\ntumult there was in my young heart at this discovery.  I hardly\\ncomprehended the nature of my position, yet I felt pleased on the whole;\\nI felt as if I were of more importance; nay, that I was more capable of\\nthinking and acting than I was twenty-four hours before.\\n\\nMy reveries were, however, disturbed by Miss Medea, who came to the\\nback-door and asked me if I was not tired of walking, and if I would not\\nlike to come in.\\n\\n\"Are you not hungry, Master Keene?  Would you like to have a nice piece\\nof cake and a glass of currant wine before dinner?  We shall not dine\\ntill three o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"If you please,\" replied I: for I would not refuse the bribe, although I\\nhad a perfect knowledge why it was offered.\\n\\nMiss Medea brought the cake and wine.  As soon as I had despatched them,\\nwhich did not take very long, she commenced her pumping, as I had\\nanticipated, and which I was determined to thwart, merely out of\\nopposition.\\n\\n\"You were sorry to leave your mamma, weren\\'t you, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; very sorry, miss.\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s your papa, dearest?  He\\'s a very pretty boy, mamma, ain\\'t he?\"\\ncontinued the young lady, putting her fingers through my chestnut curls.\\n\\n\"Yes; handsome boy,\" croaked the old lady.\\n\\n\"Papa\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead!  I thought so,\" observed Miss Medea, winking at her mother.\\n\\n\"Did you ever see your papa, dearest?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; he went to sea about eighteen months ago, and he was killed in\\naction.\"\\n\\nAfter this came on a series of questions and cross-questions; I replied\\nto her so as to make it appear that Ben was my father, and nobody else,\\nalthough I had then a very different opinion.  The fact was, I was\\ndetermined that I would not be pumped, and I puzzled them, for I stated\\nthat my aunt Milly was married to Captain Bridgeman, of the marines; and\\nnot till then did Miss Medea ask me what my father was.  My reply was\\nthat he had also been in the marines, and they consequently put him down\\nas a marine officer, as well as Captain Bridgeman.\\n\\nThis added so much to the respectability of my family, that they were\\nquite mystified, and found that it was not quite so easy to put that and\\nthat together as they had thought.\\n\\nAs soon as they were tired of questioning, they asked me if I would not\\nlike to take another turn in the garden, to which I consented; and,\\nplacing myself under the window as before, I heard Miss Medea say to her\\nmother--\\n\\n\"Father\\'s always finding out some mare\\'s nest or another; and because\\nthere is some likeness to the captain, he has, in his great wit, made an\\nimportant discovery.  It\\'s quite evident that he\\'s wrong, as he\\ngenerally is.  It\\'s not very likely that Captain Delmar should have had\\nan intrigue with the wife of a marine officer, and her sister married\\nalso into the corps.  The widow has brought him down herself, it is\\ntrue, but that proves nothing; who else was to bring him down, if it was\\nnot his mother? and the very circumstance of her going away so soon\\nproves that she felt it improper that she should remain; and, in my\\nopinion, that she is a modest, interesting young woman, in whom Captain\\nDelmar has taken an interest.  I wish father would not come here with\\nhis nonsensical ideas, telling us to make much of the boy.\"\\n\\n\"Very true, Medea,\" replied the mother; \"you might have saved that cake\\nand wine.\"\\n\\nThinks I to myself, you have not pumped me, and I never felt more\\ndelighted than at having outwitted them.  I thought it, however, prudent\\nto walk away from the window.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, Mr Culpepper returned, accompanied by one of the\\nnumerous Portsmouth fitting-out tailors.  I was summoned; the tailor\\npresented a list of what he declared to be absolutely necessary for the\\noutfit of a gentleman.\\n\\nMr Culpepper struck out two-thirds of the articles, and desired the\\nremainder to be ready on the Friday morning, it being then Wednesday.\\nThe tailor promised faithfully, and Mr Culpepper also promised most\\nfaithfully, that if the articles were not ready, they would be left on\\nhis hands.  As soon as the tailor had gone, Miss Medea asked me if I\\nwould not like to take another run in the garden.  I knew that she\\nwished to speak to her father, and therefore had a pleasure in\\ndisappointing her.  I therefore replied, that I had been there nearly\\nthe whole day, and did not wish to go out any more.\\n\\n\"Never mind whether you wish it or not; I wish you to go,\" replied Miss\\nMedea, tartly.\\n\\n\"Medea, how can you be so rude?\" cried Mr Culpepper; \"surely Mr Keene\\nmay do as he pleases.  I\\'m surprised at you, Medea.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'m surprised at you, papa, finding out a mystery when there is\\nnone,\" replied Miss Medea, very cross.  \"All you said this morning, and\\nall your surmises, have turned out to be all moonshine.  Yes, you may\\nlook, papa; I tell you--all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"Why, Medea, what nonsense you are talking,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s right,\" croaked Mrs Culpepper; \"all moonshine.\"\\n\\n\"So you need not be so very particular, papa, I can tell you,\" rejoined\\nMiss Medea, who then whispered in her father\\'s ear, loud enough for me\\nto hear, \"No such thing, nothing but a regular marine.\"\\n\\n\"Pooh, nonsense,\" replied the purser, in a low voice; \"the boy has been\\ntaught to say it--he\\'s too clever for you, Medea.\"\\n\\nAt this very true remark of her father\\'s, Miss Medea swelled into a\\ntowering passion, her whole face, neck, and shoulders--for she wore a\\nlow gown in the morning--turning to a fiery scarlet.  I never saw such a\\nfury as she appeared to be.  She rushed by me so roughly, that I was\\nthrown back a couple of paces, and then she bounced out of the room.\\n\\n\"Medea knows how to put that and that together, Mr Culpepper,\" croaked\\nout Mrs Culpepper.\\n\\n\"Medea\\'s wise in her own conceit, and you\\'re a regular old fool,\"\\nrejoined Mr Culpepper, with asperity; \"one too knowing and the other\\nnot half knowing enough.  Master Keene, I hope you are hungry, for we\\nhave a very nice dinner.  Do you like ducks and green peas?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, very much,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Were you born at Chatham, Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I was born at the Hall, near Southampton.  My mother was\\nbrought up by old Mrs Delmar, the captain\\'s aunt.\"\\n\\nI gave this intelligence on purpose; as I knew it would puzzle Miss\\nMedea, who had just returned from the kitchen.\\n\\nMr Culpepper nodded his head triumphantly to his daughter and wife, who\\nboth appeared dumb-founded at this new light thrown upon the affair.\\n\\nMiss Medea paused a moment and then said to me,--\"I wish to ask you one\\nquestion, Master Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I will not answer any more of your questions, miss,\" replied I; \"You\\nhave been questioning me all the morning, and just now, you were so rude\\nas nearly to push me down.  If you want to know anything more, ask\\nCaptain Delmar; or, if you wish it, I will ask Captain Delmar whether I\\nam to answer you, and if he says I am, I will, but not without.\"\\n\\nThis was a decided blow on my part; mother and Medea both looked\\nfrightened, and Mr Culpepper was more alarmed than either of the\\nfemales.  It proved to them that I knew what they were inquiring for,\\nwhich was to them also proof that I also knew who I was; and further, my\\nreference to Captain Delmar satisfied them that I felt sure of his\\nsupport, and they knew that he would be very much irritated if I told\\nhim on what score they had been pumping me.\\n\\n\"You are very right, Master Keene,\" said Mr Culpepper, turning very\\nred, \"to refuse to answer any questions you don\\'t like; and, Medea, I\\'m\\nsurprised at your behaviour; I insist upon it you do not annoy Master\\nKeene with any more of your impertinent curiosity.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" croaked the old lady; \"hold your tongue, Medea, hold your\\ntongue.\"\\n\\nMiss Medea, who looked as if she could tear my eyes out if she dared,\\nswallowed down her rage as well as she could.  She was mortified at\\nfinding she had made a mistake, annoyed at my answering her so boldly,\\nand frightened at her father\\'s anger; for the old gentleman was very apt\\nto vent it in the _argumentum ad feminam_, and box her ears soundly.\\n\\nFortunately dinner was served just at this moment, and this gave a turn\\nto the conversation, and also to their thoughts.  Mr Culpepper was all\\nattention, and Miss Medea, gradually recovering her temper, also became\\naffable and condescending.\\n\\nThe evening passed away very agreeably; but I went to bed early, as I\\nwished to be left to my own reflections, and it was not till daylight\\nthat I could compose my troubled mind so as to fall asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough the aversion which I had taken to the whole Culpepper family\\nwas so great, that I could have done anything to annoy them, my mind was\\nnow so fully occupied with the information which I had collected\\nrelative to my supposed birth and parentage, that I could not think of\\nmischief.\\n\\nI walked on the common or in the little garden during the whole of the\\nfollowing day, plunged in deep thought, and at night, when I went to\\nbed, I remained awake till the dawn.  During these last two days I had\\nthought and reflected more than I had perhaps done from the hour of my\\nbirth.\\n\\nThat I was better off than I should have been if I had been the son of a\\nprivate in the marines, I felt convinced; but still I had a feeling that\\nI was in a position in which I might be subjected to much insult, and\\nthat, unless I was acknowledged by my aristocratic parent, my connection\\nwith his family would be of no use to me;--and Captain Delmar, how was I\\nto behave to him?  I did not like him much, that was certain, nor did\\nthis new light which had burst forth make me feel any more love for him\\nthan I did before.  Still my mother\\'s words at Chatham rung in my ears,\\n\"Do you know who it is that you have been?\" etcetera.  I felt sure that\\nhe was my father, and I felt a sort of duty towards him; perhaps an\\nincrease of respect.\\n\\nThese were anxious thoughts for a boy not fourteen; and the Culpeppers\\nremarked, that I had not only looked very pale, but had actually grown\\nthin in the face during my short stay.\\n\\nAs I was very quiet and reserved after the first day, they were very\\nglad when my clothes were brought home, and I was reported ready to\\nembark; so was I, for I wanted to go on board and see my friend Tommy\\nDott, with whom I intended, if the subject was brought up, to consult as\\nto my proceedings, or perhaps I thought it would be better to consult\\nBob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain; I was not sure that I should not\\nadvise with them both.\\n\\nI had made up my mind how to behave to my mother.  I knew that she would\\nnever acknowledge the truth, after what had passed between the captain\\nand her when I was present; but I was resolved that I would let her know\\nthat I was in the secret; and I thought that the reply to me would be a\\nguide as to the correctness of the fact, which, with all the hastiness\\nof boyhood, I considered as incontrovertible, although I had not the\\nleast positive proof.\\n\\nThe day that I was to go on board, I requested Miss Culpepper to give me\\na sheet of paper, that I might write to my mother; she supplied me very\\nreadily, saying, \"You had better let me see if you make any mistake in\\nyour spelling before the letter goes; your mamma will be so pleased if\\nyou write your letter properly.\"  She then went down into the kitchen to\\ngive some orders.\\n\\nAs I had not the slightest intention that she should read what I wrote,\\nand resolved to have it in the post before she came up again, I was very\\nconcise in my epistle, which was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"Dear Mother:--I have found it all out--I am the son of Captain\\n  Delmar, and everyone here knows what you have kept a secret from me.\\n  I go on board to-day.\\n\\n  \"Yours truly, P. KEENE.\"\\n\\nThis was very short, and, it must be admitted, direct to the point.  I\\ncould not perhaps have written one which was so calculated to give my\\nmother uneasiness.\\n\\nAs soon as it was finished, I folded it up, and lighted a taper to seal\\nit.  Old Mrs Culpepper, who was in the room, croaked out, \"No, no; you\\nmust show it to Medea.\"  But I paid no attention to her, and having\\nsealed my letter, put on my hat, and walked out to the post-office.  I\\ndropped it into the box, and, on returning, found Mr Culpepper coming\\nhome, accompanied by Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain, and two of the\\nboat\\'s crew.\\n\\nAs I presumed, they were sent for me; I joined them immediately, and was\\nkindly greeted by Bob Cross, who said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, are you all ready for shipping?  We\\'ve come for your\\ntraps.\"\\n\\n\"All ready,\" replied I, \"and very glad to go, for I\\'m tired of staying\\non shore doing nothing.\"\\n\\nWe were soon at the house; the seamen carried away my chest and bedding,\\nwhile Bob Cross remained a little while, that I might pay my farewell to\\nthe ladies.\\n\\nThe ceremony was not attended with much regret on either side.  Miss\\nCulpepper could not help asking me why I did not show her my letter, and\\nI replied, that there were secrets in it, which answer did not at all\\nadd to her good temper; our adieus were, therefore, anything but\\naffectionate, and before the men with my effects were a hundred yards in\\nadvance, Bob Cross and I were at their heels.\\n\\n\"Well, Master Keene,\" said Bob, as we wended our way across South Sea\\nCommon, \"how do you like the purser\\'s ladies?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" replied I; \"they have done nothing but try to pump me the\\nwhole time I have been there; but they did not make much of it.\"\\n\\n\"Women will be curious, Master Keene--pray what did they try to pump\\nabout?\"\\n\\nI hardly knew how to reply, and I hesitated.  I felt a strong\\ninclination towards Bob Cross, and I had before reflected whether I\\nshould make him my confidant; still, I was undecided and made no reply,\\nwhen Bob Cross answered for me:--\\n\\n\"Look ye, child--for although you\\'re going on the quarter-deck, and I am\\nbefore the mast, you are a child compared to me--I can tell you what\\nthey tried to pump about, as well as you can tell me, if you choose.\\nAccording to my thinking, there\\'s no lad on board the frigate that will\\nrequire good advice as you will; and I tell you candidly, you will have\\nyour cards to play.  Bob Cross is no fool, and can see as far through a\\nfog as most chaps; I like you for yourself as far as I see of you, and I\\nhave not forgotten your mother\\'s kindness to me, when she had her own\\nmisery to occupy her thoughts; not that I wanted the money--it wasn\\'t\\nthe money, but the way and the circumstances under which it was given.\\nI told you I\\'d look after you a bit--a bit means a great deal with me--\\nand so I will, if you choose that I shall; if not, I shall touch my hat\\nto you, as my officer, which won\\'t help you very much.  So, now you have\\nto settle, my lad, whether you will have me as your friend, or not.\"\\n\\nThe appeal quite decided me.  \"Bob Cross,\" replied I.  \"I do wish to\\nmake you my friend; I thought of it before, but I did not know whether\\nto go to you or to Tommy Dott.\"\\n\\n\"Tommy Dott!  Well, Master Keene, that\\'s not very flattering, to put me\\nin one scale, and Tommy Dott in the other; I\\'m not surprised at its\\nweighing down in my favour.  If you wish to get into mischief you can\\'t\\napply to a better hand than Tommy Dott; but Tommy Dott is not half so\\nfit to advise you, as you are, I expect, to advise him; so make him your\\nplaymate and companion, if you please, but as to his advice, it\\'s not\\nworth asking.  However, as you have given me the preference, I will now\\ntell you that the Culpepper people have been trying to find out who is\\nyour father.  Ain\\'t I right?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, then, this is no time to talk about such things; we shall be down\\nto the boat in another minute, so we\\'ll say no more at present; only\\nrecollect, when you are on board, if they talk about appointing a man to\\ntake charge of your hammock, say that Bob Cross, the captain\\'s coxswain,\\nis, you understand, to be the person; say that and no more.  I will tell\\nyou why by-and-by, when we have time to talk together and if any of your\\nmessmates say anything to you on the same point which the Culpeppers\\nhave been working at, make no reply and hold yourself very stiff.  Now,\\nhere we are at the sally port, so there\\'s an end to our palaver for the\\npresent.\"\\n\\nMy chest and bedding were already in the boat, and as soon as Cross and\\nI had stepped in he ordered the bowman to shove off; in half an hour we\\narrived alongside the frigate, which lay at Spithead, bright with new\\npaint, and with her pennant proudly flying to the breeze.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better follow me, sir, and mind you touch your hat when the\\nofficers speak to you,\" said Bob Cross, ascending the accommodation\\nladder.  I did so, and found myself on the quarter deck, in the presence\\nof the first lieutenant and several of the officers.\\n\\n\"Well, Cross,\" said the first lieutenant.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve brought a young gentleman on board to join the ship.  Captain\\nDelmar has, I believe, given his orders about him.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I presume?\" said the first lieutenant, eyeing me from head\\nto foot.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, touching my hat.\\n\\n\"How long have you been at Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Three days, sir; I have been staying at Mr Culpepper\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Well, did you fall in love with Miss Culpepper?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I hate her.\"\\n\\nAt this answer the first lieutenant and the officers near him burst out\\na-laughing.\\n\\n\"Well, youngster, you must dine with us in the gun-room to-day; and\\nwhere\\'s Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"Here, sir,\" said Tommy Dott, coming from the other side of the\\nquarter-deck.\\n\\n\"Mr Dott, take this young gentleman down below, and show him the\\nmidshipmen\\'s berth.  Let me see, who is to take care of his hammock?\"\\n\\n\"I believe that Bob Cross is to take care of it, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"The captain\\'s coxswain--humph.  Well, that\\'s settled at all events;\\nvery good--we shall have the pleasure of your company to dinner, Mr\\nKeene.  Why, Mr Dott and you look as if you knew each other.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t we, Tommy?\" said I to the midshipman, grinning.\\n\\n\"I suspect that there is a pair of you,\" said the first lieutenant,\\nturning aft and walking away; after which Tommy and I went down the\\ncompanion ladder as fast as we could, and in a few seconds afterwards\\nwere sitting together on the same chest, in most intimate conversation.\\n\\nMy extreme resemblance to our honourable captain was not unobserved by\\nthe officers who were on the quarter-deck at the time of my making my\\nappearance; and, as I afterwards heard from Bob Cross, he was sent for\\nby the surgeon, on some pretence or another, to obtain any information\\nrelative to me.  What were Bob Cross\\'s reasons for answering as he did I\\ncould not at that time comprehend, but he explained them to me\\nafterwards.\\n\\n\"Who brought him down, Cross?\" said the surgeon, carelessly.\\n\\n\"His own mother, sir; he has no father, sir, I hear.\"\\n\\n\"Did you see her?  What sort of a person was she?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Bob Cross, \"I\\'ve seen many ladies of quality, but\\nsuch a real lady I don\\'t think I ever set my eyes upon before; and such\\na beauty--I\\'d marry to-morrow if I could take in tow a craft like her.\"\\n\\n\"How did they come down to Portsmouth?\"\\n\\n\"Why, sir, she came down to Portsmouth in a coach and four; but she\\nwalked to the George Hotel, as if she was nobody.\"\\n\\nThis was not a fib on the part of the coxswain, for we came down by the\\nPortsmouth coach; it did, however, deceive the surgeon, as was intended.\\n\\n\"Did you see anything of her, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"Not when she was with the captain, sir, but at her own lodgings I did;\\nsuch a generous lady I never met with.\"\\n\\nA few more questions were put, all of which were replied to in much the\\nsame strain by the coxswain, so as to make out my mother to be a very\\nimportant and mysterious personage.  It is true that Tommy Dott could\\nhave contradicted all this; but, in the first place, it was not very\\nlikely that there would be any communication upon the point between him\\nand the officers; and in the next I cautioned him to say nothing about\\nwhat he knew, which, as he was strongly attached to me, he strictly\\ncomplied with: so Bob Cross completely mystified the surgeon, who, of\\ncourse, made his report to his messmates.\\n\\nMr Culpepper\\'s report certainly differed somewhat from that of Bob\\nCross.  There was my statement of my aunt being married to a marine\\nofficer--but it was my statement; there was also my statement of my\\nmother residing with Captain Delmar\\'s aunt; altogether there was doubt\\nand mystery; and it ended in my mother being supposed to be a much\\ngreater person than she really was--everything tending to prove her a\\nlady of rank being willingly received, and all counter-statements looked\\nupon as apocryphal and false.\\n\\nBut whoever my mother might be, on one point every one agreed, which\\nwas, that I was the son of the Honourable Captain Delmar, and on this\\npoint I was equally convinced myself.  I waited with some anxiety for my\\nmother\\'s reply to my letter, which arrived two days after I had joined\\nthe frigate.  It was as follows:--\\n\\n  \"My dear Percival:--\\n\\n  \"You little know the pain and astonishment which I felt upon receipt\\n  of your very unkind and insulting letter; surely you could not have\\n  reflected at the time you wrote it, but must have penned it in a\\n  moment of irritation arising from some ungenerous remark which has\\n  been made in your hearing.\\n\\n  \"Alas, my dear child, you will find, now that you have commenced your\\n  career in life, that there are too many whose only pleasure is to\\n  inflict pain upon their fellow-creatures.  I only can imagine that\\n  some remark has been made in your presence, arising from there being a\\n  similarity of features between you and the Honourable Captain Delmar;\\n  that there is so has been before observed by others.  Indeed your\\n  uncle and aunt Bridgeman were both struck with the resemblance, when\\n  Captain Delmar arrived at Chatham; but this proves nothing, my dear\\n  child--people are very often alike, who have never seen each other, or\\n  heard each other mentioned, till they have by accident been thrown\\n  together so as to be compared.\\n\\n  \"It may certainly be, as your father was in the service of Captain\\n  Delmar, and constantly attended upon him, and indeed I may add as I\\n  was occasionally seeing him, that the impression of his countenance\\n  might be constantly in our memory, and--but you don\\'t understand such\\n  questions, and therefore I will say no more, except that you will\\n  immediately dismiss from your thoughts any such idea.\\n\\n  \"You forget, my dearest boy, that you are insulting me by supposing\\n  any such thing, and that your mother\\'s honour is called in question; I\\n  am sure you never thought of that when you wrote those hasty and\\n  inconsiderate lines.  I must add, my dear boy, that knowing Captain\\n  Delmar, and how proud and sensitive he is, if it should ever come to\\n  his knowledge that you had suspected or asserted what you have, his\\n  favour and protection would be lost to you for ever: at present he is\\n  doing a kind and charitable action in bringing forward the son of a\\n  faithful servant; but if he imagined for a moment that you were\\n  considered related to him he would cast you off for ever, and all your\\n  prospects in life would be ruined.\\n\\n  \"Even allowing it possible that you were what you so madly stated\\n  yourself in your letter to be, I am convinced he would do so.  If such\\n  a report came to his ears, he would immediately disavow you, and leave\\n  you to find your own way in the world.\\n\\n  \"You see, therefore, my dear boy, how injurious to you in every way\\n  such a ridiculous surmise must prove, and I trust that, not only for\\n  your own sake, but for your mother\\'s character, you will, so far from\\n  giving credence, indignantly disavow what must be a source of mischief\\n  and annoyance to all parties.\\n\\n  \"Captain Bridgeman desires me to say, that he is of my opinion, so is\\n  your aunt Milly: as for your grandmother, of course, I dare not show\\n  her your letter.  Write to me, my dear boy, and tell me how this\\n  unfortunate mistake happened, and believe me to be your affectionate\\n  mother, ARABELLA KEENE.\"\\n\\nI read this letter over ten times before I came to any conclusion; at\\nlast I said to myself, there is not in any one part of it any positive\\ndenial of the fact, and resolved some future day, when I had had some\\nconversation with Bob Cross, to show it to him, and ask his opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, at daylight, the blue Peter was hoisted at the\\nforemast, and the gun fired as a signal for sailing; all was bustle--\\nhoisting in, clearing boats of stock, and clearing the ship of women and\\nstrangers.\\n\\nAt ten o\\'clock Captain Delmar made his appearance, the hands were piped\\nup anchor, and in half an hour we were standing out for St. Helen\\'s.\\nBefore night it blew very fresh, and we went rolling down the Channel\\nbefore an easterly wind.  I went to my hammock very sick, and did not\\nrecover for several days, during which nobody asked for me, or any\\nquestions about me, except Bob Cross and Tommy Dott.\\n\\nAs soon as I was well enough, I made my appearance on deck, and was\\nordered by the first lieutenant to do my duty under the signal\\nmidshipman: this was day duty, and not very irksome; I learnt the flags,\\nand how to use a spy-glass.\\n\\nWe were charged with despatches for the fleet, then off Cadiz, and on\\nthe tenth day we fell in with it, remained a week in company, and then\\nwere ordered to Gibraltar and Malta.  From Malta we went home again with\\ndespatches, having been out three months.\\n\\nDuring this short and pleasant run, I certainly did not learn much of my\\nprofession, but I did learn a little of the ways of the world.  First,\\nas to Captain Delmar, his conduct to me was anything but satisfactory;\\nhe never inquired for me during the time that I was unwell, and took no\\nnotice of me on my reappearance.\\n\\nThe officers and young gentlemen, as midshipmen are called, were asked\\nto dine in the cabin in rotation, and I did in consequence dine two or\\nthree times in the cabin; but it appeared to me, as if the captain\\npurposely took no notice of me, although he generally did say a word or\\ntwo to the others; moreover as the signal mids were up in the morning\\nwatch, he would occasionally send to invite one of the others to\\nbreakfast with him, but he never paid me that compliment.\\n\\nThis annoyed me, and I spoke of it to Bob Cross, with whom I had had\\nsome long conversations.  I had told him all I knew relative to myself,\\nwhat my suspicions were, and I had shown him my mother\\'s reply.  His\\nopinion on the subject may be given in what follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Master Keene, you are in an awkward position; the captain is a\\nvery proud man, and too proud to acknowledge that you are any way\\nrelated to him.  It\\'s my opinion, from what you have told me, and from\\nother reasons, particularly from your likeness to the captain, that your\\nsuspicions are correct; but, what then?  Your mother is sworn to\\nsecrecy--that\\'s clear; and the captain won\\'t own you--that\\'s also very\\nclear.  I had some talk with the captain\\'s steward on the subject when I\\nwas taking a glass of grog with him the other night in this berth.  It\\nwas he that brought up the subject, not me, and he said, that the\\ncaptain not asking you to breakfast, and avoiding you, as it were, was\\nanother proof that you belonged to him; and the wishing to hide the\\nsecret only makes him behave as he does.  You have a difficult game to\\nplay, Master Keene; but you are a clever lad, and you ask advice--mind\\nyou follow it, or it\\'s little use asking it.  You must always be very\\nrespectful to Captain Delmar, and keep yourself at as great a distance\\nfrom him as he does from you.\"\\n\\n\"That I\\'m sure I will,\" replied I, \"for I dislike him very much.\"\\n\\n\"No, you must not do that, but you must bend to circumstances; by-and-by\\nthings will go on better; but mind you keep on good terms with the\\nofficers, and never be saucy, or they may say to you what may not be\\npleasant; recollect this, and things will go on better, as I said\\nbefore.  If Captain Delmar protects you with his interest, you will be a\\ncaptain over the heads of many who are now your superiors on board of\\nthis frigate.  One thing be careful of, which is, to keep your own\\ncounsel, and don\\'t be persuaded in a moment of confidence to trust\\nanything to Tommy Dott, or any other midshipman; and if any one hints at\\nwhat you suppose, deny it immediately; nay, if necessary, fight for it--\\nthat will be the way to please the captain, for you will be of his side\\nthen, and not against him.\"\\n\\nThat this advice of Bob Cross was the best that could be given to one in\\nmy position there could not be a doubt; and that I did resolve to follow\\nit, is most certain.  I generally passed away a portion of my leisure\\nhours in Bob\\'s company, and became warmly attached to him; and certainly\\nmy time was not thrown away, for I learnt a great deal from him.\\n\\nOne evening, as I was leaning against one of the guns on the main deck,\\nwaiting for Cross to come out of the cabin, I was amused with the\\nfollowing conversation between a boatswain\\'s mate and a fore-top man.  I\\nshall give it verbatim.  They were talking of one that was dead; and\\nafter the boatswain\\'s mate had said--\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s in heaven, poor fellow.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause, the fore-top man said--\\n\\n\"I wonder, Bill, whether I shall ever go to heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" replied the boatswain\\'s mate.\\n\\n\"Why, the parson says it\\'s good works; now, I certainly have been a\\npretty many times in action, and I have killed plenty of Frenchmen in my\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s sufficient, I should think; I hold my hopes upon just the\\nsame claims.  I\\'ve cut down fifty Frenchmen in my life, and if that\\nain\\'t good works, I don\\'t know what is.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose Nelson\\'s in heaven?\"\\n\\n\"Of course; if so be he wishes to be there, I should like to know who\\nwould keep him out, if he was determined on it; no, no; depend upon it\\nhe walked _slap_ in.\"\\n\\nOn our return to Portsmouth, the captain went up to the Admiralty with\\nthe despatches, the frigate remaining at Spithead, ready to sail at a\\nmoment\\'s notice.\\n\\nI was now quite accustomed to the ship and officers; the conviction I\\nhad of my peculiar position, together with the advice of Bob Cross, had\\nvery much subdued my spirit; perhaps the respect created by discipline,\\nand the example of others, which produced in me a degree of awe of the\\ncaptain and the lieutenants, assisted a little--certain it is, that I\\ngained the goodwill of my messmates, and had not been in any scrape\\nduring the whole cruise.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant was a stern, but not unkind man; he would blow you\\nup, as we termed it, when he scolded for half an hour without ceasing.\\nI never knew a man with such a flow of words; but if permitted to go on\\nwithout interruption, he was content, without proceeding to further\\npunishment.  Any want of respect, however, was peculiarly offensive to\\nhim, and any attempt to excuse yourself was immediately cut short with,\\n\"No reply, sir.\"\\n\\nThe second day after our return to Spithead, I was sent on shore in the\\ncutter to bring off a youngster who was to join the ship; he had never\\nbeen to sea before; his name was Green, and he was as green as a\\ngooseberry.  I took a dislike to him the moment that I saw him, because\\nhe had a hooked nose and very small ferrety eyes.  As we were pulling on\\nboard he asked me a great many questions of all kinds, particularly\\nabout the captain and officers, and to amuse myself and the boat\\'s crew,\\nwho were on the full titter, I exercised my peculiar genius for\\ninvention.\\n\\nAt last, after I had given a character of the first lieutenant, which\\nmade him appear a sort of marine ogre, he asked how it was I got on with\\nhim:--\\n\\n\"O, very well,\" replied I; \"but I\\'m a freemason, and so is he, and he\\'s\\nnever severe with a brother mason.\"\\n\\n\"But how did he know you were a mason?\"\\n\\n\"I made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me,\\nand he left off almost immediately; that is, when I made the second\\nsign; he did not when I made the first.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to know these signs.  Won\\'t you tell them to me?\"\\n\\n\"Tell them to you! oh no, that won\\'t do,\" replied I.  \"I don\\'t know you.\\nHere we are on board--in bow,--rowed of all, men.  Now, Mr Green, I\\'ll\\nshow you the way up.\"\\n\\nMr Green was presented, and ushered into the service much in the same\\nway as I was; but he had not forgotten what I said to him relative to\\nthe first lieutenant; and it so happened that, on the third day he\\nwitnessed a jobation, delivered by the first lieutenant to one of the\\nmidshipmen, who, venturing to reply, was ordered to the mast-head for\\nthe remainder of the day; added to which, a few minutes afterwards, the\\nfirst lieutenant ordered two men to be put both legs in irons.  Mr\\nGreen trembled as he saw the men led away by the master-at-arms, and he\\ncame to me:\\n\\n\"I do wish, Keene, you would tell me those signs,\" said he; \"can\\'t you\\nbe persuaded to part with them?  I\\'ll give you any thing that I have\\nwhich you may like.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I should like to have that long spy-glass of yours, for\\nit\\'s a very good one; and, as signal-midshipman, will be useful to me.\"\\n\\n\"I will give it you with all my heart,\" replied he, \"if you will tell me\\nthe signs.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, come down below, give me the glass, and I will tell them to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nMr Green and I went down to the berth, and I received the spy-glass as\\na present in due form.  I then led him to my chest in the steerage, and\\nin a low, confidential tone, told him as follows:--\\n\\n\"You see, Green, you must be very particular about making those signs,\\nfor if you make a mistake, you will be worse off than if you never made\\nthem at all, for the first lieutenant will suppose that you are trying\\nto persuade him that you are a mason, when you are not.  Now, observe,\\nyou must not attempt to make the first sign until he has scolded you\\nwell; then, at any pause, you must make it; thus, you see, you must put\\nyour thumb to the tip of your nose, and extend your hand straight out\\nfrom it, with all the fingers separated, as wide as you can.  Now, do it\\nas I did it.  Stop--wait a little, till that marine passes.  Yes, that\\nis it.  Well, that is considered the first proof of your being a mason,\\nbut it requires a second.  The first lieutenant will, I tell you\\nfrankly, be or rather pretend to be, in a terrible rage, and will\\ncontinue to rail at you; you must, therefore, wait a little till he\\npauses; and then, you observe, put up your thumb to your nose, with the\\nfingers of your hands spread out as before, and then add to it your\\nother hand, by joining your other thumb to the little finger of the hand\\nalready up, and stretch your other hand and fingers out like the first.\\nThen you will see the effects of the second sign.  Do you think you can\\nrecollect all this? for, as I said before, you must make no mistake.\"\\n\\nGreen put his hands up as I told him, and after three or four essays\\ndeclared himself perfect, and I left him.\\n\\nIt was about three days afterwards that Mr Green upset a kid of dirty\\nwater upon the lower deck which had been dry holystoned, and the mate of\\nthe lower deck, when the first lieutenant went his round, reported the\\ncircumstance to exculpate himself.  Mr Green was consequently summoned\\non the quarter-deck; and the first lieutenant, who was very angry,\\ncommenced, as usual, a volley of abuse on the unfortunate youngster.\\n\\nGreen, recollecting my instructions, waited till the first lieutenant\\nhad paused, and then made the first freemason sign, looking up very\\nboldly at the first lieutenant, who actually drew back with astonishment\\nat this contemptuous conduct, hitherto unwitnessed on board of a\\nman-at-war.\\n\\n\"What! sir,\" cried the first lieutenant.  \"Why, sir, are you mad?--you,\\njust come into the service, treating me in this manner!  I can tell you,\\nsir, that you will not be three days longer in the service--no, sir, not\\nthree days; for either you leave the service or I do.  Of all the\\nimpudence, of all the insolence, of all the contempt I have heard of,\\nthis beats all--and from such a little animal as you.  Consider yourself\\nas under an arrest, sir, till the captain comes on board, and your\\nconduct is reported; go down below, sir, immediately.\"\\n\\nThe lieutenant paused, and now Green gave him sign the second, as a\\nreply, thinking that they would then come to a right understanding--but\\nto his astonishment, the first lieutenant was more curious than ever;\\nand calling the sergeant of marines, ordered him to take Mr Green down,\\nand put him in irons, under the half-deck.\\n\\nPoor Green was handed down, all astonishment, at the want of success of\\nhis mason\\'s signs.  I, who stood abaft, was delighted at the success of\\nmy joke, while the first lieutenant walked hastily up and down the deck,\\nas much astonished as enraged at such insulting and insolent conduct\\nfrom a lad who had not been a week in the service.\\n\\nAfter a time the first lieutenant went down below, when Bob Cross, who\\nwas on deck, and who had perceived my delight at the scene, which was to\\nhim and all others so inexplicable, came up to me and said:--\\n\\n\"Master Keene, I\\'m sure, by your looks, you knew something about this.\\nThat foolish lad never had dared do so, if he knew what it was he had\\ndone.  Now, don\\'t look so demure, but tell me how it is.\"\\n\\nI walked aft with Bob Cross, and confided my secret to him; he laughed\\nheartily, and said:--\\n\\n\"Well, Tommy Dott did say that you were up to any thing, and so I think\\nyou are; but you see this is a very serious affair for poor Green, and,\\nlike the fable of the frogs, what is sport to you is death to others.\\nThe poor lad will be turned out of the service, and lose his chance of\\nbeing a post captain; so you must allow me to explain the matter so that\\nit gets to the ears of the first lieutenant as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied I, \"do as you like, Bob; if any one\\'s to be turned out\\nof the service for such nonsense, it ought to be me, and not Green, poor\\nsnob.\"\\n\\n\"No fear of your being turned out; the first lieutenant won\\'t like you\\nthe worse, and the other officers will like you better especially as I\\nshall say that it is by your wish that I explain all to get Mr Green\\nout of the scrape.  I\\'ll go to the surgeon and tell him--but, Master\\nKeene, don\\'t you call such matters _nonsense_, or you\\'ll find yourself\\nmistaken one of these days.  I never saw such disrespect on a\\nquarter-deck in all my life--worse than mutiny a thousand times.\"  Here\\nBob Cross burst out into a fit of laughter, as he recalled Green\\'s\\nextended fingers to his memory, and then he turned away and went down\\nbelow to speak to the surgeon.\\n\\nAs soon as Cross had quitted the deck, I could not restrain my curiosity\\nas to the situation of my friend Green; I therefore went down the ladder\\nto the half-deck, and there, on the starboard side between the guns, I\\nperceived the poor fellow, with his legs in irons, his hands firmly\\nclasped together, looking so woeful and woe-begone, every now and then\\nraising his eyes up to the beam of the upper deck, as if he would appeal\\nto heaven, that I scarcely could refrain from laughing.  I went up to\\nhim and said:--\\n\\n\"Why, Green, how is all this?--what has happened?\"\\n\\n\"Happened?\" said the poor fellow; \"happened? see what has happened; here\\nI am.\"\\n\\n\"Did you make the freemason\\'s signs?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I?  Yes--I did: Oh, what will become of me?\"\\n\\n\"You could not have made them right; you must have forgotten them.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I made them as you told me; I\\'m quite sure of that.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps I did not recollect them exactly myself: however, be of\\ngood heart; I will have the whole matter explained to the first\\nlieutenant.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do; only get me out of this.  I don\\'t want the glass back.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have it done directly,\" replied I.\\n\\nAs I went away, Bob Cross came up, and said I was wanted by the first\\nlieutenant in the gun-room.  \"Don\\'t be afraid,\" said he: \"they\\'ve been\\nlaughing at it already, and the first lieutenant is it a capital humour;\\nstill he\\'ll serve you out well; you must expect that.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I make him the sign, Cross?\" replied I, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no; you\\'ve gone far enough, and too far already; mind what I say to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nI went down into the gun-room, when a tittering ceased as the sentry\\nopened the door, and I walked in.\\n\\n\"Did you want me, sir?\" said I to the first lieutenant, touching my hat,\\nand looking very demure.\\n\\n\"So, Mr Keene, I understand it was you who have been practising upon\\nMr Green, and teaching him insult and disrespect to his superior\\nofficers on the quarter-deck.  Well, sir?\"\\n\\nI made no reply, but appeared very penitent.\\n\\n\"Because a boy has just come to sea, and is ignorant of his profession,\\nit appears to be a custom--which I shall take care shall not be followed\\nup--to play him all manner of tricks, and tell him all manner of\\nfalsehoods.  Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Mr Green and I have both just come to sea, sir, and the midshipmen all\\nplay us so many tricks,\" replied I, humbly, \"that I hardly know whether\\nwhat I do is right or wrong.\"\\n\\n\"But, sir, it was you who played this trick to Mr Green.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, I told him so for fun, but I didn\\'t think he was such a fool\\nas to believe me.  I only said that you were a freemason, and that\\nfreemasons were kind to each other, and that you gave one another signs\\nto know one another by; I heard you say you were a freemason, sir, when\\nI dined in the gun-room.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I did say so; but that is no reason for your teaching him to\\nbe impudent.\"\\n\\n\"He asked me for the signs, sir, and I didn\\'t know them exactly; so I\\ngave him the signs that Mr Dott and I always make between us.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Dott and you--a pretty pair, as I said before.  I\\'ve a great mind\\nto put you in Mr Green\\'s place--at all events, I shall report your\\nconduct when the captain comes from London.  There, sir, you may go.\"\\n\\nI put on a penitent face as I went out wiping my eyes with the back of\\nmy hands.  After I went out, I waited a few seconds at the gun-room\\ndoor, and then the officers, supposing that I was out of hearing, gave\\nvent to their mirth, the first lieutenant laughing the loudest.\\n\\n\"Cross is right,\" thought I, as I went up the ladder; a minute\\nafterwards, Mr Green was set free, and, after a severe reprimand, was\\nallowed to return to his duty.\\n\\n\"You are well out of that trick, my hearty,\" said Bob Cross; \"the first\\nlieutenant won\\'t say a word to the captain, never fear; but don\\'t try it\\nagain.\"\\n\\nBut an event occurred a few hours afterwards which might have been\\nattended with more serious consequences.  The ship was, during the day,\\nsurrounded by shore boats of all descriptions, containing Jews, sailors\\'\\nwives, and many other parties, who wished to have admittance on board.\\nIt was almost dusk, the tide was running strong flood, and the wind was\\nvery fresh, so that there was a good deal of sea.  All the boats had\\nbeen ordered to keep off by the first lieutenant, but they still\\nlingered, in hope of getting on board.\\n\\nI was looking over the stern, and perceived that the boat belonging to\\nthe bumboat woman, who was on board of the ship, was lying with her\\npainter fast to the stern ladder; the waterman was in her, as well as\\none of the sailors\\' wives, who had left her own wherry in hopes of\\ngetting on board when the waterman went alongside to take in the\\narticles not sold, when the bumboat woman left the ship, which would be\\nin a few minutes, as it was nearly gun-fire for sunset.  The waterman,\\nwho thought it time to haul alongside, and wished to communicate with\\nhis employer on board, was climbing up by the stern ladder.\\n\\n\"That\\'s against orders, you know,\" cried I to the man.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; but it is so rough, that the boat would be swamped if it were\\nto remain alongside long, and I hope you won\\'t order me down again;\\nthere\\'s some nice cakes in the boat, sir, just under the stern sheets,\\nif you would like to have them, and think it worth while to go down for\\nthem.\"\\n\\nThis was a bribe, and I replied, \"No, I don\\'t want your cakes, but you\\nmay come up.\"\\n\\nThe man thanked me, and walked forward as soon as he had gained the\\ndeck.  On second thoughts, I determined that I would have the cakes; so\\nI descended by the stern ladder, and desiring the woman who was left in\\nthe boat to haul upon the rope, contrived to get into the boat.\\n\\n\"What is it you want, my dear?\" said the woman.\\n\\n\"I come for some of those cakes under the stern sheets,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll soon rummage them out,\" said she, \"and I hope you will let\\nme slip on board when the boat is alongside.  Mind, sir, how you step,\\nyou\\'ll smash all the pipes.  Give me your hand.  I\\'m an old sailor.\"\\n\\n\"I should not think so,\" replied I, looking at her.  I could hardly make\\nout her face, but her form was small, and, if an old sailor, she\\ncertainly was a very young woman.\\n\\nWe had a good many articles to remove before we could get at the cakes,\\nwhich were under the stern sheets; and the boat rocked and tossed so\\nviolently with the sea which was running, that we were both on our knees\\nfor some little while before we obtained the basket: when we did, to our\\nsurprise, we found that the boat\\'s painter, somehow or another, had\\nloosened, and that during our search we had drifted nearly one hundred\\nyards from the ship.\\n\\n\"Mercy on me!--why, we are adrift,\" exclaimed the woman.  \"What shall we\\ndo?  It\\'s no use hailing, they\\'ll never hear us; look well round for any\\nboat you may see.\"\\n\\n\"It is getting so dark that we shall not see far,\" replied I, not much\\nliking our position.  \"Where shall we go to?\"\\n\\n\"Go to!--clean out to St. Helen\\'s, if the boat does not fill before we\\nget there; and further than that too, if I mistake not, with this gale\\nof wind.  We may as well say our prayers, youngster, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we make sail upon her?\" replied I.  \"Can\\'t we try and pull on\\nshore somewhere?  Had we not better do that, and say our prayers\\nafterwards?\"\\n\\n\"Well said, my little bantam,\" replied the woman: \"you would have made a\\ngood officer if you had been spared; but the fact is, boy, that we can\\ndo nothing with the oars in this heavy sea; and as for the sail, how can\\nyou and I step the mast, rolling and tossing about in this way?  If the\\nmast were stepped, and the sail set, I think I could manage to steer, if\\nthe weather was smoother, but not in this bubble and this gale; it\\nrequires older hands than either you or I.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, what must we do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, we must sit still and trust to our luck, bale out the boat, and\\nkeep her from swamping as long as we can, and between times we may cry,\\nor we may pray, or we may eat the cakes and red herrings, or the soft\\nbread and other articles in the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s bale the boat out first,\" said I, \"for she\\'s half full of water;\\nthen we\\'ll have something to eat, for I feel hungry and cold already,\\nand then we may as well say our prayers.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and I tell you what, we\\'ll have something to drink, too, for I\\nhave a drop for Jem, if I could have got on board.  I promised it to\\nhim, poor fellow, but it\\'s no use keeping it now, for I expect we\\'ll\\nboth be in Davy\\'s locker before morning.\"\\n\\nThe woman took out from where it was secreted in her dress, a bladder\\ncontaining spirits; she opened the mouth of it, and poured out a portion\\ninto one of the milk-cans; having drunk herself, she handed it to me,\\nbut not feeling inclined, and being averse to spirits, I rejected it,\\n\"Not just now,\" said I, \"by-and-by perhaps.\"\\n\\nDuring the time of this conversation we were swept by a strong tide and\\nstrong wind right out of the anchorage at Spithead; the sea was very\\nhigh, and dashed into the boat, so that I was continually baling to keep\\nit free; the night was as dark as pitch; we could see nothing except the\\nlights of the vessels which we had left far away from us, and they were\\nnow but as little twinkles as we rose upon the waves.  The wind roared,\\nand there was every appearance of a heavy gale.\\n\\n\"Little hopes of our weathering this storm,\" said the woman; \"we shall\\nsoon be swamped if we do not put her before the wind.  I\\'ll see if I\\ncannot find the lines.\"\\n\\nShe did so after a time, and by means of a rudder put the boat before\\nthe wind; the boat then took in much less water, but ran at a swift rate\\nthrough the heavy sea.\\n\\n\"There, we shall do better now; out to sea we go, that\\'s clear,\" said\\nthe woman; \"and before daylight we shall be in the Channel, if we do not\\nfill and go down; and then, the Lord have mercy upon us, that\\'s all!\\nWon\\'t you take a drop?\" continued she, pouring out some spirits into the\\ncan.\\n\\nAs I felt very cold, I did not this time refuse.  I drank a small\\nquantity of the spirits; the woman took off the remainder, which, with\\nwhat she had previously drunk, began to have an effect upon her.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my little Trojan,\" said she, and she commenced singing.\\n\"A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether; in spite of wind and\\nweather, boys, in spite of wind and weather.  Poor Jem,\" continued she,\\n\"he\\'ll be disappointed; he made sure of being glorious to-night, and I\\nmade sure to sleep by his side--now he\\'ll be quite sober--and I\\'ll be\\nfood for fishes; it\\'s a cold bed that I shall turn into before morning,\\nthat\\'s certain.  Hand me the cakes, boy, if you can fumble them out; the\\nmore we fill ourselves, the less room for salt water.  Well, then, wind\\nand waves are great bullies; they fly slap back in a fright when they\\nbang against a great ship; but when they get hold of a little boat like\\nthis, how they leap and topple in, as if they made sure of us [here a\\nwave dashed into the boat].  Yes, that\\'s your sort.  Come along, swamp a\\nlittle boat you washy cowards, it\\'s only a woman and a boy.  Poor Jim,\\nhe\\'ll miss me something, but he\\'ll miss the liquor more; who cares?\\nLet\\'s have another drop.\"\\n\\n\"Give me the lines, then,\" said I, as I perceived she was letting them\\ngo, \"or we shall be broadside to the waves again.\"\\n\\nI took the rudder lines from her, and steered the boat, while she again\\nresorted to the bladder of spirits.\\n\\n\"Take another sip,\" said she, after she had filled the milk-can; \"it\\nwon\\'t harm you.\"\\n\\nI thought the same, for I was wet through, and the wind, as it howled,\\npierced me to the bones; I took a small quantity as before, and then\\ncontinued to keep the boat before the wind.  The sea was increasing very\\nmuch and although no sailor, I felt fully convinced that the boat could\\nnot live much longer.\\n\\nIn the meantime the woman was becoming intoxicated very fast.  I knew\\nthe consequence of this, and requested her to bale out the boat: she did\\nso, and sang a mournful sort of song as she baled, but the howling of\\nthe wind prevented me from distinguishing the words.\\n\\nI cannot well analyse my feelings at this time--they were confused; but\\nthis I know, self-preservation and hope were the most predominant.  I\\nthought of my mother, of my aunt, of Captain Bridgeman, Captain Delmar,\\nand Bob Cross; but my thoughts were as rapid as the gale which bore us\\nalong, and I was too much employed in steering the boat, and preventing\\nthe seas from filling it, to have a moment to collect my ideas.\\n\\nAgain the woman applied to the bladder of spirits, and offered some to\\nme; I refused.  I had had enough, and by this time she had had too much,\\nand after an attempt to bale she dropped down in the stern sheets,\\nsmashing pipes and everything beneath her, and spoke no more.\\n\\nWe had now been more than four hours adrift; the wind was as strong as\\never, and, I thought, the sea much higher; but I kept the boat steady\\nbefore the wind, and by degrees, as I became more accustomed to steer,\\nshe did not take in so much water; still the boat appeared to be sinking\\ndeeper down, and after a time I considered it necessary to bale her out.\\nI did so with my hat, for I found it was half full of water; and then I\\nexecrated the woman for having intoxicated herself, so as to be useless\\nin such an emergency.\\n\\nI succeeded in clearing the boat of the major portion of the water,\\nwhich was no easy task, as the boat, having remained broadside to the\\nwind, had taken in the sea continually as I baled it out.  I then once\\nmore resumed the helm, and put the boat before the wind, and thus did I\\ncontinue for two hours more, when the rain came down in torrents, and\\nthe storm was wilder than ever, but a Portsmouth wherry is one of the\\nbest boats ever built, and so it proved in this instance.  Still I was\\nnow in a situation most trying for a lad between fourteen and fifteen;\\nmy teeth chattered with the cold, and I was drenched through and\\nthrough; the darkness was opaque, and I could see nothing but the white\\nfoam of the waves, which curled and broke close to the gunwale of the\\nboat.\\n\\nAt one moment I despaired, and looked for immediate death; but my\\nbuoyant spirit raised me up again, and I hoped.  It would be daylight in\\na few hours, and oh! how I looked and longed for daylight.  I knew I\\nmust keep the boat before the wind; I did so, but the seas were worse\\nthan ever; they now continually broke into the boat, for the tide had\\nturned, which had increased the swell.\\n\\nAgain I left the helm and bailed out; I was cold and faint, and I felt\\nrecovered with the exertion; I also tried to rouse the woman, but it was\\nuseless.  I felt for her bladder of liquor, and found it in her bosom,\\nmore than half empty.  I drank more freely, and my spirits and my\\ncourage revived.  After that, I ate, and steered the boat, awaiting the\\ncoming daylight.\\n\\nIt came at last slowly--so slowly; but it did come, and I felt almost\\nhappy.  There is such a horror in darkness when added to danger; I felt\\nas if I could have worshipped the sun as it rose slowly, and with a\\nwatery appearance, above the horizon.  I looked around me: there was\\nsomething like land astern of us, such as I had seen pointed out as land\\nby Bob Cross, when off the coast of Portugal; and so it was--it was the\\nIsle of Wight: for the wind had changed when the rain came down, and I\\nhad altered the course of the boat so that for the last four hours I had\\nbeen steering for the coast of France.\\n\\nBut, although I was cold and shivering, and worn out with watching, and\\ntired with holding the lines by which the wherry was steered, I felt\\nalmost happy at the return of day.  I looked down upon my companion in\\nthe boat; she lay sound asleep, with her head upon the basket of tobacco\\npipes, her bonnet wet and dripping, with its faded ribbons hanging in\\nthe water which washed to and fro at the bottom of the boat, as it\\nrolled and rocked to the motion of the waves; her hair had fallen over\\nher face, so as almost to conceal her features; I thought that she had\\ndied during the night, so silent and so breathless did she lie.  The\\nwaves were not so rough now as they had been, for the flood tide had\\nagain made; and as the beams of the morning sun glanced on the water,\\nthe same billows which appeared so dreadful in the darkness appeared to\\ndance merrily.\\n\\nI felt hungry; I took up a red herring from one of the baskets, and tore\\nit to pieces with my teeth.  I looked around me in every quarter to see\\nif there was any vessel in sight, but there was nothing to be seen but\\nnow and then a screaming sea-gull.  I tried to rouse my companion by\\nkicking her with my foot; I did not succeed in waking her up, but she\\nturned round on her back, and, her hair falling from her face,\\ndiscovered the features of a young and pretty person, apparently not\\nmore than nineteen or twenty years old; her figure was slight and well\\nformed.\\n\\nYoung as I was, I thought it a pity that such a nice-looking person--for\\nshe still was so, although in a state of disorder, and very dirty--\\nshould be so debased by intoxication; and as I looked at the bladder,\\nstill half full of spirits I seized it with an intention to throw it\\noverboard, when I paused at the recollection that it had probably saved\\nmy life during the night, and might yet be required.\\n\\nI did not like to alter the course of the boat, although I perceived\\nthat we were running fast from the land; for although the sea had gone\\ndown considerably, there was still too much for the boat to be put\\nbroadside to it.  I cannot say that I was unhappy; I found my situation\\nso very much improved to what it was during the darkness of the night.\\nThe sun shone bright, and I felt its warmth.  I had no idea of being\\nlost--death did not enter my thoughts.  There was plenty to eat, and\\nsome vessel would certainly pick us up.  Nevertheless, I said my\\nprayers, more devoutly than I usually did.\\n\\nAbout noon, as near as I could guess, the tide changed again, and as the\\nwind had lulled very much, there was little or no swell.  I thought\\nthat, now that the motion was not so great, we might possibly ship the\\nforemast and make some little sail upon the boat; and I tried again more\\nearnestly to rouse up my companion; after a few not very polite\\nattempts, I succeeded in ascertaining that she was alive.\\n\\n\"Be quiet, Jim,\" said she, with her eyes still closed; \"it\\'s not five\\nbells yet.\"\\n\\nAnother kick or two, and she turned herself round and stared wildly.\\n\\n\"Jim,\" said she, rubbing her eyes, and then she looked about her, and at\\nonce she appeared to remember what had passed; she shrieked, and covered\\nher face up with her hands.\\n\\n\"I thought it was a dream, and was going to tell Jim all about it, at\\nbreakfast,\" said she, sorrowfully, \"but it\\'s all true--true as gospel.\\nWhat will become of me?  We are lost, lost, lost!\"\\n\\n\"We are not lost, but we should have been lost this night if I had been\\nas drunk as you have been,\" replied I; \"I\\'ve had work enough to keep the\\nboat above water, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s truth,\" replied she, rising up and taking a seat upon the thwart\\nof the boat.  \"God, forgive me, poor wretch that I am: what will Jim\\nthink, and what will he say, when he sees my best bonnet in such a\\npickle?\"\\n\\n\"Are you quite sure that you\\'ll ever see Jim again, or that you\\'ll ever\\nwant your best bonnet?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true.  If one\\'s body is to be tossed about by green waves, it\\'s\\nlittle matter whether there\\'s a bonnet or shawl on.  Where are we, do\\nyou know?\"\\n\\n\"I can just see the land out there,\" replied I, pointing astern.  \"The\\nsea is smooth; I think we could ship the foremast, and get sail upon\\nher.\"\\n\\nThe young woman stood up in the boat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"I\\'m pretty steady; I think we could.  Last night in\\nthe dark and the tossing sea I could do nothing, but now I can.  What a\\nblessing is daylight to cowards like me--I am only afraid in the dark.\\nWe must put some sail upon the boat, or nobody will see us.  What did\\nyou do with the bladder of liquor?\"\\n\\n\"Threw it overboard,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Had you courage to do that?--and watching through the the night so wet\\nand cold.  Well you did right--I could not have done it.  Oh! that\\nliquor--that liquor; I wish there wasn\\'t such a thing in the world, but\\nit\\'s too late now.  When I first married James Pearson, and the garland\\nwas hung to the main-stay of the frigate, nobody could persuade me to\\ntouch it, not even James himself, whom I loved so much.  Instead of\\nquarrelling with me for not drinking it, as he used to do, he now\\nquarrels with me for drinking the most.  If you\\'ll come forward, sir,\\nand help me, we\\'ll soon get up the foremast.  This is it, you see, with\\nthe jib passed round it.  Jim often says that I\\'d make a capital sailor,\\nif I\\'d only enter in man\\'s clothes--but as I tell him, I should be put\\nup at the gangway, for not being sober, before I\\'d been on board a\\nweek.\"\\n\\nWe contrived to ship the mast, and set the jib and foresail.  As soon as\\nthe sheets were hauled aft, my companion took the steering lines,\\nsaying, \"I know how to manage her well enough, now it\\'s daylight, and\\nI\\'m quite sober.  You must be very tired, sir; so sit down on the\\nthwart, or lie down if you please, and take a nap; all\\'s safe enough\\nnow--see, we lie up well for the land;\" and such was the case, for she\\nhad brought the boat to the wind, and we skimmed over the waves at the\\nrate of three or four miles an hour.  I had no inclination to sleep; I\\nbaled the boat out thoroughly, and put the baskets and boxes into some\\nkind of order.  I then sat down on the thwarts, first looking round for\\na vessel in sight; but seeing none, I entered into conversation with my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Peggy Pearson; I have my marriage lines to show: they can throw nothing\\nin my face, except that I\\'m fond of liquor, God forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"And what makes you so fond of it now, since you say that, when you were\\nmarried, you did not care for it?\"\\n\\n\"You may well say that: it all came of _sipping_.  James would have me\\non his knee, and would insist on my taking a sip; and to please him I\\ndid, although it made me almost sick at first, and then after a while I\\ndid not mind it; and then, you see, when I was waiting at the sallyport\\nwith the other women, the wind blowing fresh, and the spray wetting us\\nas we stood on the shingle with our arms wrapped up in our aprons,\\nlooking out for a boat from the ship to come on shore, they would have a\\nquartern, and make me take a drop; and so it went on.  Then James made\\nme bring him liquor on board, and I drank some with him; but what\\nfinished me was, that I heard something about James when he was at\\nPlymouth, which made me jealous, and then for the first time I got\\ntipsy.  After that, it was all over with me; but, as I said before, it\\nbegan with sipping--worse luck, but it\\'s done now.  Tell me what has\\npassed during the night.  Has the weather been very bad?\"\\n\\nI told her what had occurred, and how I had kicked her to wake her up.\\n\\n\"Well, I deserved more than kicking, and you\\'re a fine, brave fellow;\\nand if we get on board the Calliope again--and I trust to God we shall--\\nI\\'ll take care to blow the trumpet for you as you deserve.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any one to blow the trumpet for me,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you be proud; a good word from me may be of use to you and it\\'s\\nwhat you deserve.  The ship\\'s company will think highly of you, I can\\ntell you.  A good name is of no small value--a captain has found out\\nthat before now; you\\'re only a lad, but you\\'re a regular trump, and the\\nseamen shall all know it, and the officers too.\"\\n\\n\"We must get on board the ship first,\" replied I, \"and we are a long way\\nfrom it just now.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re all right, and I have no fear.  If we don\\'t see a vessel we shall\\nfetch the land somewhere before to-morrow morning, and it don\\'t look as\\nif there would be any more bad weather.  I wonder if they have sent\\nanything out to look after us?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said I, pointing astern, \"it\\'s a sail of some kind.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Peggy, \"so it is; it\\'s a square-rigged vessel coming up the\\nChannel--we had better get on the other tack, and steer for her.\"\\n\\nWe wore the boat round and ran in the direction of the vessel; in three\\nhours we were close to her; I hailed her as she came down upon us but no\\none appeared to hear us or see us, for she had lower studding-sails set,\\nand there was no one forward.  We hailed again, and the vessel was now\\nwithin twenty yards, and we were right across her bows; a man came\\nforward, and cried out, \"Starboard your helm,\" but not in sufficient\\ntime to prevent the vessel from striking the wherry, and to stave her\\nquarter in; we dropped alongside as the wherry filled with water, and we\\nwere hauled in by the seamen over the gunwale, just as she turned over\\nand floated away astern.\\n\\n\"Touch and go, my lad,\" said one of the seamen who had hauled me on\\nboard.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you keep a better look out?\" said Peggy Pearson, shaking her\\npetticoats, which were wet up to the knees.  \"Paint eyes in the bows of\\nyour brig, if you haven\\'t any yourself.  Now you\\'ve lost a boatful of\\nred-herrings, eggs, and soft tommy--no bad things after a long cruise;\\nwe meant to have paid our passage with them--now you must take us for\\nnothing.\"\\n\\nThe master of the vessel, who was on deck, observed that I was in the\\nuniform of an officer.  He asked me how it was we were found in such a\\nsituation?  I narrated what had passed in few words.  He said that he\\nwas from Cadiz bound to London, and that he would put us on shore at any\\nplace up the river I would like, but that he could not lose the chance\\nof the fair wind to land me anywhere else.\\n\\nI was too thankful to be landed anywhere; and telling him that I should\\nbe very glad if he could put me on shore at Sheerness, which was the\\nnearest place to Chatham, I asked leave to turn into one of the cabin\\nbed-places, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nI may as well here observe, that I had been seen by the sentry abaft to\\ngo down by the stern ladder into the boat, and when the waterman came\\nback shortly afterwards to haul his boat up, and perceived that it had\\ngone adrift, there was much alarm on my account.  It was too dark to\\nsend a boat after us that night, but the next morning the case was\\nreported to the admiral of the port, who directed a cutter to get under\\nweigh and look for us.\\n\\nThe cutter had kept close in shore for the first day, and it was on the\\nmorning after I was picked up by the brig, that, in standing more out,\\nshe had fallen in with the wherry, bottom up.  This satisfied them that\\nwe had perished in the rough night, and it was so reported to the\\nport-admiral and to Captain Delmar, who had just come down from London.\\n\\nI slept soundly till the next morning, when I found that the wind had\\nfallen and that it was nearly calm.  Peggy Pearson was on deck; she had\\nwashed herself and smoothed out with an iron the ribbons of her bonnet,\\nand was really a very handsome young woman.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said she, \"I didn\\'t know your name before you told it to\\nthe skipper here; you\\'re in a pretty scrape.  I don\\'t know what Jim\\nPearson will say when you go back, running away with his wife as you\\nhave done.  Don\\'t you think I had better go back first, and smooth\\nthings over.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! you laugh now,\" replied I; \"but you didn\\'t laugh the night we went\\nadrift.\"\\n\\n\"Because it was no laughing matter.  I owe my life to you, and if I had\\nbeen adrift by myself, I should never have put my foot on shore again.\\nDo you know,\" said she to me, very solemnly, \"I\\'ve made a vow--yes, a\\nvow to Heaven, that I\\'ll leave off drinking; and I only hope I may have\\nstrength given me to keep it.\"\\n\\n\"Can you keep it?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think I can; for when I reflect that I might have gone to my account\\nin that state, I really feel a horror of liquor.  If James would only\\ngive it up, I\\'m sure I could.  I swear that I never will bring him any\\nmore on board--that\\'s settled.  He may scold me, he may beat me (I don\\'t\\nthink he would do that, for he never has yet); but let him do what he\\npleases, I never will; and if he keeps sober because he hasn\\'t the means\\nof getting tipsy, I am sure that I shall keep my vow.  You don\\'t know\\nhow I hate myself; and although I\\'m merry, it\\'s only to prevent my\\nsitting down and crying like a child at my folly and wickedness in\\nyielding to temptation.\"\\n\\n\"I little thought to hear this from you.  When I was with you in the\\nboat, I thought you a very different person.\"\\n\\n\"A woman who drinks, Mr Keene, is lost to everything.  I\\'ve often\\nthought of it, after I\\'ve become sober again.  Five years ago I was the\\nbest girl in the school.  I was the monitor and wore a medal for good\\nconduct.  I thought that I should be so happy with James; I loved him\\nso, and do so still.  I knew that he was fond of liquor, but I never\\nthought that he would make me drink.  I thought then that I should cure\\nhim, and with the help of God I will now; not only him, but myself too.\"\\n\\nAnd I will here state that Peggy Pearson, whose only fault was the\\npassion she had imbibed for drinking, did keep her vow; the difficulty\\nof which few can understand who have not been intemperate themselves;\\nand she not only continued sober herself, but by degrees broke her\\nhusband of his similar propensity to liquor.\\n\\nIt was not till the evening of the fourth that we arrived at the Nore.\\nI had four pounds in my pocket at the time that I went adrift, which was\\nmore than sufficient, even if I had not intended to go and see my\\nmother.  A wherry came alongside, and Peggy Pearson and I stepped into\\nit, after I had thanked the captain, and given a sovereign to the seamen\\nto drink my health.\\n\\nAs soon as we landed at Sheerness I gave another of my sovereigns to\\nPeggy, and left her to find her way back to Portsmouth, while I walked\\nup to Chatham to my mother\\'s house.\\n\\nIt was past eight o\\'clock and quite dark when I arrived; the shop was\\nclosed, and the shutters up at the front door; so I went round to the\\nback to obtain admittance.  The door was not fast, and I walked into the\\nlittle parlour without meeting with anybody.  I heard somebody upstairs,\\nand I thought I heard sobbing; it then struck me that my supposed loss\\nmight have been communicated to my mother.  There was a light on the\\nparlour table, and I perceived an open letter lying near to it.  I\\nlooked at it; it was the handwriting of Captain Delmar.  The candle\\nrequired snuffing; I raised the letter to the light that I might read\\nit, and read as follows:--\\n\\n  \"MY DEAR ARABELLA:--\\n\\n  \"You must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings, and it is most\\n  painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them.\\n  A dreadful accident has occurred, and indeed I feel most sincerely for\\n  you.  On the night of the 10th, Percival was in a boat which broke\\n  adrift from the ship in a gale of wind; it was dark, and the fact not\\n  known until too late to render any assistance.\\n\\n  \"The next day a cutter was despatched by the admiral to look for the\\n  boat, which must have been driven out to sea; there was a woman in the\\n  boat as well as _our_ poor boy.  Alas!  I regret to say that the boat\\n  was found bottom up, and there is no doubt but that _our_ dear child\\n  has perished.\\n\\n  \"You will believe me when I say that I deeply lament his loss; not\\n  only on your account, but because I had become most partial to him for\\n  his many good qualities, and often have I regretted that his peculiar\\n  position prevented me from showing him openly that regard which, as\\n  _his father_, I really felt for him.\\n\\n  \"I know that I can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings,\\n  and yet I fain would, for you have been so true, and anxious to please\\n  me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy, that\\n  there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands.\\n\\n  \"Comfort yourself, dear Arabella, as well as you can with the\\n  reflection that it has been the will of Heaven, to whose decrees we\\n  must submit with resignation.  I am deeply suffering myself; for, had\\n  he lived, I swear to you that I intended to do much more for him than\\n  ever I had promised you.  He would have made a good and gallant sailor\\n  had it pleased Heaven to spare him, and you would have been proud of\\n  him; but it has been decided otherwise, and we must bow in obedience\\n  to His will.  God bless you, and support you in your afflictions, and\\n  believe me still,\\n\\n  \"Yours, most sincerely and faithfully,\\n\\n  \"PERCIVAL DELMAR.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is so,\" thought I; \"here I have it under his own hand.\"  I\\nimmediately folded up the letter, and put it into my bosom.  \"You and I\\nnever part, that is certain,\" murmured I.  I had almost lost my breath\\nfrom emotion, and I sat down to recover myself.  After a minute or two I\\npulled the letter out and read it over again.  \"And he is my father, and\\nhe loves me, but dare not show it, and he intended to do more for me\\nthan even he had promised my mother.\"\\n\\nI folded up the letter, kissed it fervently, and replaced it in my\\nbosom.  \"Now,\" thought I, \"what shall I do?  This letter will be\\nrequired of me by my mother, but never shall she get it; not tears, nor\\nthreats, nor entreaties shall ever induce me to part with it.  What\\nshall I do?  Nobody has seen me--nobody knows that I have been here.  I\\nwill go directly and join my ship; yes, that will be my best plan.\"\\n\\nI was so occupied with my own reverie, that I did not perceive a\\nfootstep on the stairs, until the party was so far down that I could not\\nretreat.  I thought to hide myself.  I knew by the list shoes that it\\nmust be my grandmother.  A moment of reflection.  I blew out the light\\non the table, and put myself in an attitude: one arm raised aloft, the\\nother extended from my body, and with my mouth wide open and my eyes\\nfixed, I awaited her approach.  She came in--saw me--uttered a fearful\\nshriek, and fell senseless on the floor; the candle in her hand was\\nextinguished in the fall: I stepped over her body; and darting out into\\nthe back-yard, gained the door, and was in the street in a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\\n\\nI was soon in the high road, and clear of the town of Chatham.  As my\\nobject was that it should not be supposed that I had been there, I made\\nall the haste I could to increase my distance; I therefore walked on in\\nthe direction of Gravesend, where I arrived about ten o\\'clock.  A return\\nchaise offered to take me to Greenwich for a few shillings, and before\\nmorning dawned I had gained the metropolis.\\n\\nI lost no time in inquiring when the coaches started for Portsmouth, and\\nfound that I was in plenty of time, as one set off at nine o\\'clock.\\n\\nMuch as I wished to see London, my curiosity gave way to what I\\nconsidered the necessity of my immediate return to the frigate.  At\\nseven o\\'clock in the evening I arrived at Portsmouth; I hastened down,\\njumped into a wherry, and was on board of the frigate again by eight.\\n\\nIt may be imagined that my sudden and unexpected appearance caused no\\nlittle surprise.  Indeed, the first lieutenant considered it right to\\nsend the gig on shore at that late hour to apprise the captain of my\\nreturn, and Bob Cross had just time to give me a wring of the hand\\nbefore he jumped into the boat, and went away to make the report.\\n\\nI gave a history of my adventures to the officers, leaving them,\\nhowever, to suppose that I had never been to Chatham, but had gone up to\\nLondon in the merchant vessel.\\n\\nPearson, the boatswain\\'s mate, came to make inquiries about his wife;\\nand, soon after, Bob Cross came on board with the captain\\'s orders, that\\nI should go on shore to him in the gig on the following morning.\\n\\nI wished very much to consult Bob Cross previous to my seeing the\\ncaptain.  I told him so, and he agreed to meet me on the gangway about\\nten o\\'clock, as by that time the officers would be almost all in bed,\\nand there would be less chance of interruption.\\n\\nIt was a fine, clear night, and as soon as we found ourselves alone I\\nnarrated to him, in a low voice, all that had taken place, and gave him\\nthe contents of the letter which I had taken possession of.  I then\\nasked him what he thought I ought to do, now that I was certain of being\\nthe son of the captain.\\n\\n\"Why, Master Keene, you have done it very cleverly, that\\'s the truth;\\nand that letter, which is as good as a certificate from Captain Delmar,\\nmust be taken great care of.  I hardly know where it ought to be put,\\nbut I think the best thing will be for me to sew it in a seal-skin pouch\\nthat I have, and then you can wear it round your neck, and next your\\nskin; for, as you say, you and that must never part company.  But,\\nMaster Keene, you must be silent as death about it.  You have told me,\\nand I hope I may be trusted, but trust nobody else.  As to saying or\\nhinting anything to the captain, you mustn\\'t think of it; you must go on\\nas before, as if you knew nothing, for if he thought you had the letter\\nin your possession he would forget you were his son, and perhaps hate\\nyou.  He never would have been induced to acknowledge you under his own\\nhand as his son had he not thought that you were dead and gone, as\\neverybody else did; so behave just as respectful and distant as before.\\nIt\\'s only in some great emergency that that letter will do you any good,\\nand you must reserve it in case of need.  If your mother is suspicious,\\nwhy, you must blind her.  Your granny will swear that it was your ghost;\\nyour mother may think otherwise, but cannot prove it; she dare not tell\\nthe captain that she suspects you have the letter, and it will all blow\\nover after a cruise or two.\"\\n\\nI agreed to follow the advice of Bob Cross, as I saw it was good, and we\\nparted for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning I went on shore to the captain, who received me, very\\nstiffly, with, \"Mr Keene, you have had a narrow escape.  How did you\\nget back?\"\\n\\nI replied, that the vessel which picked me up was bound to London and\\nthat I had taken the coach down.\\n\\n\"Well, I never had an idea that we should have seen you again and I have\\nwritten to your mother, acquainting her with your loss.\"\\n\\n\"Have you, sir?\" replied I; \"it will make her very unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it will; but I shall write by this post, stating that you\\nhave been so fortunately preserved.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I; \"have you any further orders, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, Mr Keene; you may go on board and return to your duty.\"\\n\\nI made my bow, and quitted the room; went down below, and found Bob\\nCross waiting for me.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said he, as we walked away.\\n\\n\"Stiff as ever,\" replied I: \"told me to go on board and \\'tend to my\\nduty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I knew it would be so,\" replied Bob; \"it\\'s hard to say what stuff\\nthem great nobs are made of.  Never mind that; you\\'ve your own game to\\nplay, and your own secret to keep.\"\\n\\n\"His secret,\" replied I, biting my lips, \"to keep or to tell, as may\\nhappen.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let your vexation get the better of you, Master Keene; you\\'ve the\\nbest of it, if you only keep your temper; let him play his cards, and\\nyou play yours.  As you know his cards and he don\\'t know yours, you must\\nwin the game in the end--that is, if you are commonly prudent.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, Cross,\" replied I; \"but you forget that I am but a boy.\"\\n\\n\"You are but a boy, Master Keene, but you\\'ve no fool\\'s head on your\\nshoulders.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" replied I; \"but here we are at the boat.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; and, as I live, here\\'s Peggy Pearson.  Well, Peggy, how did you\\nlike your cruise with Master Keene?\"\\n\\n\"If I ever go on another, I hope he will be my companion.  Master Keene,\\nwill you allow me to go on board with you to see my husband?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Peggy,\" replied Cross; \"the first lieutenant would not refuse\\nyou after what has happened, nor Captain Delmar either, stiff as he is:\\nfor, although he never shows it, he don\\'t want feeling.  Jim will be\\nglad to see you, Peggy; you haven\\'t an idea how he took on, when he\\nheard of your loss.  He borrowed a pocket-handkerchief from the corporal\\nof marines.\"\\n\\n\"I suspect he\\'d rather borrow a bottle of rum from the purser,\" replied\\nPeggy.\\n\\n\"Recollect, Peggy,\" said I, holding up my finger.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, I do recollect; I pledge you my word that I have not tasted\\na drop of spirits since we parted--and that with a sovereign in my\\npocket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, only keep to it--that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"I will, indeed, Mr Keene; and, what\\'s more, I shall love you as long\\nas I live.\"\\n\\nWe pulled on board in the gig, and Peggy was soon in the arms of her\\nhusband.  As Pearson embraced her at the gangway--for he could not help\\nit--the first lieutenant very kindly said, \"Pearson, I shan\\'t want you\\non deck till after dinner: you may go below with your wife.\"\\n\\n\"Now, may God bless you, for a cross-looking, kind-hearted gentleman,\"\\nsaid Peggy to the first lieutenant.\\n\\nPeggy was as good as her word to me; she gave such an account of my\\ncourage and presence of mind, of her fears and at last of her getting\\ntipsy--of my remaining at the helm and managing the boat all night by\\nmyself, that I obtained great reputation among the ship\\'s company, and\\nit was all reported to the officers, and worked its way until it came\\nfrom the first lieutenant to the captain, and from the captain to the\\nport admiral.  This is certain, that Peggy Pearson did do me a good\\nservice, for I was no longer looked upon as a mere youngster, who had\\njust come to sea, and who had not been tried.\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bob Cross, a day or two afterwards, \"it seems, by\\nPeggy Pearson\\'s report, that you\\'re not frightened at a trifle.\"\\n\\n\"Peg Pearson\\'s report won\\'t do me much good.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to know better, Master Keene, than to say that; a mouse may\\nhelp a lion, as the fable says.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you learn all your fables, Cross?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you; there\\'s a nice little girl that used to sit on my knee\\nand read her fables to me, and I listened to her because I loved her.\"\\n\\n\"And does she do so now?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no; she\\'s too big for that--she\\'d blush up to the temples; but\\nnever mind the girl or the fables.  I told you that Peggy had reported\\nyour conduct, as we say in the service.  Now do you know, that this very\\nday I heard the first lieutenant speaking of it to the captain, and\\nyou\\'ve no idea how proud the captain looked, although he pretended to\\ncare nothing about it; I watched him, and he looked as much as to say,\\n`that\\'s my boy.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, if that pleases him, I\\'ll make him prouder yet of me, if I have\\nthe opportunity,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"That you will, Master Keene, if I\\'m any judge of fizonomy; and that\\'s\\nthe way to go to a parent\\'s heart: make him feel proud of you.\"\\n\\nI did not forget this, as the reader will eventually discover.\\n\\nI had written to my mother, giving her a long account of my adventures,\\nbut not saying a word of my having been at Chatham.  I made her suppose,\\nas I did the captain, that I had been carried up to London.  My letter\\nreached her the day after the one announcing my safety, written to her\\nby Captain Delmar.\\n\\nShe answered me by return of post, thanking Heaven for my preservation,\\nand stating how great had been her anguish and misery at my supposed\\nloss.  In the latter part of the letter was this paragraph:--\\n\\n  \"Strange to say, on the night of the 16th, when I was on my bed in\\n  tears, having but just received the news of your loss, your\\n  grandmother went downstairs, and declares that she saw you or your\\n  ghost in the little back parlour.  At all events, I found her\\n  insensible on the floor, so that she must have seen something.  She\\n  might have been frightened at nothing; and yet I know not what to\\n  think, for there are circumstances which almost make _me_ believe that\\n  somebody was in the house.  I presume you can prove an _alibi_.\"\\n\\nThat my mother had been suspicious, perhaps more than suspicious, from\\nthe disappearance of the letter, I was convinced.  When I replied to\\nher, I said:--\\n\\n  \"My _alibi_ is easily proved by applying to the master and seamen of\\n  the vessel on board of which I was.  Old granny must have been\\n  frightened at her own shadow: the idea of my coming to your house, and\\n  having left it without seeing you is rather too absurd; granny must\\n  have invented the story, because she hates me, and thought to make you\\n  do the same.\"\\n\\nWhatever my mother may have thought, she did not again mention the\\nsubject.  I had, however, a few days afterwards, a letter from my aunt\\nMilly, in which she laughingly told the same story of granny swearing\\nthat she had seen me or my ghost.  \"At first we thought it was your\\nghost, but since a letter from Captain Delmar to your mother has been\\nmissing, it is now imagined that you have been here, and have taken\\npossession of it.  You will tell me, my dearest Percival, I\\'m sure, if\\nyou did play this trick to granny, or not; you know you may trust me\\nwith any of your tricks.\"\\n\\nBut I was not in this instance to be wheedled by my aunt.  I wrote in\\nreturn, saying how much I was amazed at my grandmother telling such\\nfibs, and proved to her most satisfactorily that I was in London at the\\ntime they supposed I might have been at Chatham.\\n\\nThat my aunt had been requested by my mother to try to find out the\\ntruth, I was well convinced: but I felt my secret of too much importance\\nto trust either of them and from that time the subject was never\\nmentioned; and I believe it was at last surmised that the letter might\\nhave been destroyed accidentally or purposely by the maid-servant, and\\nthat my grandmother had been frightened at nothing at all--an opinion\\nmore supported, as the maid, who had taken advantage of my mother\\'s\\nretiring to her room, and had been out gossiping, declared that she had\\nnot left the premises three minutes, and not a soul could have come in.\\nMoreover, it was so unlikely that I could have been in Chatham without\\nbeing recognised by somebody.\\n\\nMy grandmother shook her head, and said nothing during all this\\ncanvassing of the question; but my aunt Milly declared that I never\\nwould have been at Chatham without coming to see her.  And it was her\\nopinion that the servant girl had read the letter when left on the\\ntable, and had taken it out to show to her associates; and somebody who\\nwished to have a hold upon my mother by the possession of the letter had\\nretained it.\\n\\nI think my mother came to that opinion at last, and it was the source of\\nmuch uneasiness to her.  She dared not say a word to Captain Delmar, and\\nevery day expected to have an offer made of returning the letter, upon a\\ncertain sum being paid down.  But the offer was never made, as the\\nletter had been sewed up by Bob Cross in the piece of seal-skin, and was\\nworn round my neck with a ribbon, with as much care as if it had been a\\nsupposed bit of the wood of the true cross, possessed by some old female\\nCatholic devotee.\\n\\nBut long before all these discussions were over, H.M. ship Calliope had\\nbeen ordered to sail, and was steering down the Channel before a smart\\nbreeze.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\\n\\nAlthough I have so much to say as to oblige me to pass over without\\nnotice the majority of my companions, I think I ought to dedicate one\\nchapter to a more particular description of those with whom I was now\\nprincipally in contact on board of the Calliope.\\n\\nI have already spoken much of the Honourable Captain Delmar, but I must\\ndescribe him more particularly.  When young, he must have been a very\\nhandsome man; even now, although nearly fifty years of age, and his hair\\nand whiskers a little mixed with grey, he was a fine-looking personage,\\nof florid complexion, large blue eyes, nose and mouth very perfect: in\\nheight he was full six feet; and he walked so erect that he looked even\\ntaller.\\n\\nThere was precision, I may say dignity, in all his motions.  If he\\nturned to you, it was slowly and deliberately; there was nothing like\\nrapidity in his movement.  On the most trifling occasions, he wrapped\\nhimself up in etiquette with all the consequence of a Spanish Hidalgo;\\nand showed in almost every action and every word that he never forgot\\nhis superiority of birth.\\n\\nNo one, except myself, perhaps, would ever have thought of taking a\\nliberty with him; for although there was a pomposity about him, at the\\nsame time it was the pomposity of a high-bred gentleman, who respected\\nhimself, and expected every one to do the same.\\n\\nThat sometimes a little mirth was occasioned by his extreme precision is\\ntrue; but it was whispered, not boldly indulged in.  As to his qualities\\nas an officer and seaman, I shall only say, that they were considered\\nmore than respectable.  Long habit of command had given him a fair\\nknowledge of the duties in the first instance, and he never condescended\\n(indeed, it would have been contrary to his character) to let the\\nofficers or seamen know whether he did or did not know anything about\\nthe second.\\n\\nAs to his moral character, I can only say, that it was very difficult to\\nascertain it.  That he would never do that which was in the slightest\\ndegree derogatory to the character of a gentleman was most certain: but\\nhe was so wrapped up in exclusiveness, that it was almost impossible to\\nestimate his feelings.  Occasionally, I may say very rarely, he might\\nexpress them; but if he did, it was but for a moment, and he was again\\nreserved as before.\\n\\nThat he was selfish is true; but who is not? and those in high rank are\\nstill more so than others, not so much by nature, but because their self\\nis encouraged by those around them.  You could easily offend his pride\\nbut he was above being flattered in a gross way.  I really believe that\\nthe person in the ship for whom he had the least respect was the\\nobsequious Mr Culpepper.  Such was the Honourable Captain Delmar.\\n\\nMr Hippesley, the first lieutenant, was a broad-shouldered,\\nungainly-looking personage.  He had more the appearance of a master in\\nthe service than a first lieutenant.  He was a thorough seaman; and\\nreally, for a first lieutenant, a very good-natured man.  All that was\\nrequisite, was to allow his momentary anger to have free escape by the\\nsafety-valve of his mouth: if you did not, an explosion was sure to be\\nthe result.\\n\\nHe was, as we use the term at sea, a regular ship husband--that is to\\nsay, he seldom put his foot on shore; and if he did, he always appeared\\nanxious to get on board again.  He was on good terms, but not familiar,\\nwith his messmates, and very respectful to the captain.  There was no\\nother officer in the service who would have suited Captain Delmar so\\nwell as Mr Hippesley, who, although he might occasionally grumble at\\nnot being promoted, appeared on the whole to be very indifferent about\\nthe matter.\\n\\nThe men were partial to him, as they always are to one who, whatever may\\nbe his peculiarities, is consistent.  Nothing is more unpleasant to men\\nthan to sail under a person whom, to use their own expression, \"they\\nnever knew where to find.\"\\n\\nThe second and third lieutenants, Mr Percival and Mr Weymss, were\\nyoung men of good family, and were admitted to a very slight degree of\\nfamiliarity with Captain Delmar: they were of gentlemanly manners, both\\ngood seamen, and kind to their inferiors.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, the purser, was my abomination--a nasty, earwigging,\\nflattering, bowing old rogue.  The master, Mr Smith, was a very quiet\\nman, plain and unoffending, but perfectly master of, and always\\nattentive to, his duty.\\n\\nThe marine officer, Mr Tusk, was a nonentity put into a red jacket.\\nThe surgeon was a tall, and very finicking sort of gentleman as to\\ndress; but well informed, friendly in disposition, and perfectly\\nacquainted with his profession.\\n\\nMy messmates were most of them young men of good birth, with the\\nexception of Tommy Dott, who was the son of a warrant officer, and Mr\\nGreen, whose father was a boot-maker in London.  I shall not, however,\\nwaste my reader\\'s time upon them; they will appear when required.  I\\nshall, therefore, now proceed with my narrative.\\n\\nIt is usually the custom for the midshipmen to take up provisions and\\nspirits beyond their allowance, and pay the purser an extra sum for the\\nsame; but this Mr Culpepper would not permit--indeed, he was the most\\nstingy and disagreeable old fellow that I ever met with in the service.\\nWe never had dinner or grog enough, or even lights sufficient for our\\nwants.\\n\\nWe complained to the first lieutenant, but he was not inclined to assist\\nus: he said we had our allowance, and it was all we could demand; that\\ntoo much grog was bad for us, and as for candles, they only made us sit\\nup late when we ought to be in bed: he was, moreover, very strict about\\nthe lights being put out.  This, however, was the occasion of war to the\\nknife between the midshipmen and Mr Culpepper.\\n\\nBut it was of no avail; he would seldom trust his own steward or the\\nmate of the main deck; whenever he could, he superintended the serving\\nout of all provisions and mixing of the grog: no wonder that he was said\\nto be a rich man.  The only party to whom he was civil was Mr\\nHippesley, the first lieutenant, and the captain; both of whom had the\\npower of annoying him, and reducing his profits.\\n\\nTo the captain he was all humility; every expense that he required was,\\nwith his proffered bow, cheerfully submitted to; but he gained on the\\nwhole by this apparent liberality, as the captain was rather inclined to\\nprotect him in all other points of service, except those connected with\\nhis own comforts and luxuries; and many a good job did Mr Culpepper get\\ndone for him, by humbly requesting and obsequiously bowing.\\n\\nWe had been at sea for about a week, and were running down towards the\\nisland of Madeira, which we expected to reach the next morning.  Our\\ndestination was a secret, as our captain sailed with sealed orders, to\\nbe opened when off that island.\\n\\nThe weather was very fine and warm, and the wind had fallen, when at\\nsundown high land was reported from the mast-head, at about forty miles\\ndistant.  I was, as on the former cruise, signal midshipman, and did day\\nduty--that is, I went down with the sun, and kept no night watch.\\n\\nI had been cogitating how I could play some trick to Mr Culpepper: the\\nmidshipmen had often proposed that we should do so, but I had made up my\\nmind that, whenever I did, I would make no confidant.  Tommy Dott often\\nsuggested an idea, but I invariably refused, as a secret is only a\\nsecret when it is known to one person: for that reason I never consulted\\nBob Cross, because I knew that he would have persuaded me not to do so;\\nbut after anything was happily executed, I then used to confide in him.\\n\\nI observed before that Mr Culpepper wore a flaxen wig, and I felt sure,\\nfrom his penuriousness, that he was not likely to have more than one on\\nboard.  I, therefore, fixed upon his wig as the object of my vengeance,\\nand having made up my mind on the night that we made the island of\\nMadeira, I determined to put my project in execution.\\n\\nFor convenience, the first lieutenant had a small ladder which went down\\nthrough the skylight of the gun-room so that they could descend direct,\\ninstead of going round by the after-hatchway, and entering by the\\ngun-room doors, where the sentry was placed.\\n\\nI went to my hammock and slept till the middle watch was called; I then\\ngot up and dressed myself without being perceived.\\n\\nAs soon as the lieutenant of the middle watch had been called by the\\nmate, who lighted his candle and left him to dress himself, I came up by\\nthe after-ladder, and, watching an opportunity when the sentry at the\\ncaptain\\'s cabin door had walked forward, I softly descended by the\\nskylight ladder into the gun-room.\\n\\nThe light in the cabin of the lieutenant, who was dressing, was quite\\nsufficient, and the heat of the weather was so great, that all the\\nofficers slept with their cabin doors fastened back, for ventilation; I\\nhad, therefore, no difficulty in putting my hand on the purser\\'s wig,\\nwith which I escaped unperceived, and immediately turned in again to my\\nhammock, to consider what I should do with my prize.\\n\\nShould I throw it overboard; should I stuff it down the pump-well, or\\nslip it into the ship\\'s coppers, that it might re-appear when the\\npea-soup was baled out or dinner; or should I put it into the manger\\nforward, where the pigs were?\\n\\nIn the meantime, while I was considering the matter, the midshipman of\\nthe first watch came down and turned in, and all was again quiet, except\\nan occasional nasal melody from some heavy sleeper.\\n\\nAt last, quite undecided, I peeped through the clews of my hammock to\\nsee what the sentry at the gun-room door was about, and found that he\\nhad sat down on a chest, and was fast asleep.  I knew immediately that\\nthe man was in my power, and I did not fear him; and then it was that\\nthe idea came into my head, that I would singe the purser\\'s wig.  I went\\nsoftly to the sentry\\'s light, took it from the hook, and went down with\\nit into the cockpit, as being the best place for carrying on my\\noperations.  The wig was very greasy, and every curl, as I held it in\\nthe candle, flared up, and burned beautifully to within a quarter of an\\ninch of the caul.\\n\\nIt was soon done, and I replaced the sentry\\'s light; and finding that\\nthe gun-room door was a-jar, I went in softly, and replaced the wig\\nwhere I had taken it from, repassed the sentry, who was still fast\\nasleep, and regained my hammock, intending to undress myself in it; but\\nI had quite forgotten one thing (I was soon reminded of it)--I heard the\\nvoice of the officer of the watch I calling out to the sentry at the\\ncabin door--\\n\\n\"Sentry, what\\'s that smell of burning?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, sir,\" replied the sentry; \"I was just thinking of going\\nforward for the ship\\'s corporal.\"\\n\\nThe smell, which had gradually ascended from the cockpit, now spread\\nfrom deck to deck, and became stronger and stronger.  The gun-room-door\\nsentry jumped up at the voice of the lieutenant, and called out that\\nthere was a very strong smell in the cockpit.  The lieutenant and mate\\nof the watch came down, and it was immediately supposed that the\\nspirit-room had caught fire, for the smell was really very powerful.\\n\\nThe first lieutenant, who had wakened up at the voices, was out in a\\nminute; he put his head over the cockpit, and ordering the officer of\\nthe watch to call the drummer, and beat to quarters, ran up to inform\\nthe captain.\\n\\nThe drummer was out in a moment, and, seizing his drum, which hung up by\\nthe mainmast, ran up in his shirt and beat the tattoo.\\n\\nThe whole ship\\'s company rose up at the sound, which they knew was the\\nsignal for something important; and the beat of the drum was followed up\\nby the shrill piping of the boatswain\\'s mates at each hatchway.\\n\\nAt that moment, some frightened man belonging to the watch cried out\\nthat the ship was on fire, and the lower decks were immediately a scene\\nof bustle and confusion.\\n\\nPerhaps there is nothing more awful than the alarm of fire at sea; the\\nfeeling that there is no escape--the only choice being by which element,\\nfire or water, you choose to perish.  But if it is awful in daylight,\\nhow much more so is it to be summoned up to await such peril when you\\nhave been sleeping in fancied bounty.\\n\\nThe captain had hurried on his clothes, and stood on the quarter-deck.\\nHe was apparently calm and collected; but, as usual, the first\\nlieutenant carried on the duty, and well he did it.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the gunner?  Mr Hutt, bring up the keys from my cabin, and\\nhave all ready for clearing the magazines if required.  Firemen, get\\nyour buckets to bear; carpenters, rig the pumps.  Silence there, fore\\nand aft.\"\\n\\nBut the confusion became very great, and there evidently was a panic.\\nThe captain then interposed, calling out to the boatswain and his mates\\nto send every man aft on the quarter-deck.\\n\\nThis order was obeyed; the men came thronging like a flock of sheep,\\nhuddling together and breathless.\\n\\n\"Silence there, my men,\" cried Captain Delmar--\"silence.  I say; is this\\nthe conduct of men-of-war\\'s-men?  Every man of you sit down on deck--\\npass the word there for every man to sit down.\"\\n\\nThe order was mechanically obeyed, and as soon as the ship\\'s company\\nwere all seated, the captain said--\\n\\n\"I tell you what, my lads, I\\'m ashamed of you: the way to put out a fire\\nis to be cool and calm, obeying orders and keeping silence.  Now collect\\nyourselves, all of you, for until you are all quiet and cool, you will\\nsit where you are.\"\\n\\nAfter a pause of a few seconds--\\n\\n\"Now, my men, are you more steady?  Recollect, be cool, and keep\\nsilence.  Carpenter, are the pumps rigged?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the carpenter.\\n\\n\"Now, firemen, go for your buckets; let nobody else move.  Silence--not\\na word: three foremast guns main-deck, to your quarters.  Silence and\\nquiet, if you please.  Now, are you all steady?--then, to your quarters,\\nmy men, and wait for orders.\"\\n\\nIt was astonishing how collected the ship\\'s company became by the\\njudicious conduct of the captain, who now continued to command.  When\\nthe men had gone down to their stations, he directed the two junior\\nlieutenants to go and examine where the fire was, and to be careful not\\nto lift the hatches if they discovered that it was in the spirit-room.\\n\\nI had been on the quarter-deck some time, and, being aware of the cause,\\nof course was not at all alarmed: and I had exerted myself very\\nassiduously in keeping the men cool and quiet, shoving the men down who\\nwere unwilling to sit down on the deck, and even using them very\\nroughly; showing a great deal more _sang froid_ than any other of the\\nofficers, which of course was not to be wondered at.\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who was most terribly alarmed, had come up on deck, and\\nstood trembling close to the side of the captain and first lieutenant;\\nhe had pulled on his wig without discovering that it had been burnt, and\\nas I passed him, the burnt smell was very strong indeed; so thought the\\ncaptain and the first lieutenant, who were waiting the return of the\\nofficers.\\n\\n\"I smell the fire very strong just now,\" said the captain to the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, every now and then it is very strong,\" replied the first\\nlieutenant.\\n\\nThe purser\\'s wig was just between them,--no wonder that they smelt it.\\nAfter two or three minutes the officers came up, and reported that they\\ncould discover no fire, and that there was very little smell of fire\\ndown below.\\n\\n\"And yet I smell it now,\" said Captain Delmar.\\n\\n\"So do I, sir,\" said the second lieutenant; \"and it really smells\\nstronger on deck than it does down below.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very odd; let them continue the search.\"\\n\\nThe search was continued; the first lieutenant now going down, and after\\na time they said that the strongest smell was from the purser\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\"Mr Culpepper, they say the smell is in your cabin,\" said Captain\\nDelmar; \"go down, if you please; they may want to open your lockers.\"\\n\\nMr Culpepper, who still trembled like an aspen, went down the ladder,\\nand I followed him; but in descending the second ladder his foot\\nslipped, and he fell down the hatchway to the lower deck.\\n\\nI hastened down after him; he was stunned, and I thought this a good\\nopportunity to pull off his wig, which I did very dexterously, and\\nconcealed it.  He was taken into the gun-room, and the surgeon called,\\nwhile I walked up on deck, and quietly dropped the wig overboard at the\\ngangway.\\n\\nMy reason for doing this was, that having no idea that my trick would\\nhave created so much confusion, and have turned up the officers and men\\nas it did, I thought that the purser\\'s wig would, the next morning,\\naccount for the smell of fire, and an investigation take place, which,\\nalthough it might not lead to discovery, would certainly lead to\\nsuspicion; so the wig was now floating away, and with the wig went away\\nall evidence.\\n\\nAfter a search of nearly half an hour, nothing was discovered; the\\ndrummer was ordered to beat the retreat, and all was quiet again.\\n\\nI went to bed quite satisfied with the events of the night, and slept\\nthe sleep of innocence--at least I slept just as soundly.\\n\\nThis mysterious affair ever remained a mystery: the only loss was the\\npurser\\'s wig, but that was nothing, as Mr Culpepper acknowledged that\\nhe did not know himself what he was about, and, for all he knew to the\\ncontrary, he might have thrown it overboard.\\n\\nMy conduct on this occasion again gained me great credit.  It had been\\nremarked by the captain and officers, and I rose in estimation.  How I\\nmight have behaved had I really supposed that the ship was on fire, is\\nquite another affair--I presume not quite so fearlessly.  As it was, I\\nwas resolved to take all the credit given to me and for that reason it\\nwas not till a long while afterwards, that I hinted the secret even to\\nBob Cross.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\\n\\nThe next morning, when we arrived at Funchal, we found that our orders\\nwere for the West Indies: we stayed one day to take in wine and then\\nhove up the anchor, and went on to our destination.  We soon got into\\nthe trades, and run them fast down till we arrived at Carlisle Bay,\\nBarbadoes, where we found the admiral and delivered our despatches.  We\\nwere ordered to water and complete as soon as possible, as we were to be\\nsent on a cruise.\\n\\nTommy Dott, my quondam ally, was in disgrace.  He had several times\\nduring the cruise proposed that I should join him in several plots of\\nmischief, but I refused, as I did not consider them quite safe.\\n\\n\"You are not the keen fellow I thought you were,\" said he; \"you are up\\nto nothing now; there\\'s no fun in you, as there used to be.\"\\n\\nHe was mistaken; there was fun in me, but there was also prudence, and\\nfrom what I had latterly seen of Tommy Dott, I did not think he was to\\nbe trusted.\\n\\nThe day after we anchored at Carlisle Bay, Tommy came to me and said,\\n\"Old Culpepper serves out plums and suet this afternoon; I heard him\\ntell steward.  Now, I think we may manage to get some--I never saw\\nbetter plums on board of a ship.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I like raisins as well as you do, Tommy--but what is\\nyour plan?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve got my squirt: and old Culpepper never lights more than one\\nof his purser\\'s dips (small candles) in the steward\\'s room.  I\\'ll get\\ndown in the cockpit in the dark, and squirt at the candle--the water\\nwill put it out, and he\\'ll send the steward for another light, and then\\nI\\'ll try and get some.\"\\n\\nIt was not a bad plan, but still I refused to join in it, as it was only\\nthe work of one person, and not two.  I pointed that out to him and he\\nagreed with me, saying that he would do it himself.\\n\\nWhen Mr Culpepper went down into the steward\\'s room, Tommy\\nreconnoitred, and then came into the berth and filled his squirt.\\n\\nAlthough I would not join him, I thought I might as well see what was\\ngoing on and therefore descended the cockpit ladder soon after Tommy,\\nkeeping out of the way in the foremost part of the cockpit, where it was\\nquite dark.\\n\\nTommy directed his squirt very dexterously, hit the lighted wick of the\\nsolitary candle, which fizzed, sputtered, and finally gave up the ghost.\\n\\n\"Bless me!\" said Mr Culpepper, \"what can that be?\"\\n\\n\"A leak from the seams above I suppose,\" said the steward:\\n\\n\"I will go to the gallery for another light.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, be quick,\" said Mr Culpepper, who remained in the steward\\'s\\nroom in the dark, until the return of the steward.\\n\\nTommy Dott then slipped in softly, and commenced filling all his pockets\\nwith the raisins; he had nearly taken in his full cargo, when, somehow\\nor another, Mr Culpepper stepped forward from where he stood, and he\\ntouched Tommy, whom he immediately seized crying out, \"Thieves!\\nthieves!--call the sentry!--sentry, come here.\"\\n\\nThe sentry of the gun-room door went down the ladder as Mr Culpepper\\ndragged out Tommy, holding him fast by both hands.\\n\\n\"Take him, sentry--take him in charge.  Call the master-at-arms--little\\nthief.  Mr Dott!  Hah--well, we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\nThe consequence was, that Mr Tommy Dott was handed from the sentry to\\nthe master-at-arms, and taken up on the quarterdeck, followed by Mr\\nCulpepper and his steward.\\n\\nThere was no defence or excuse to be made: the pockets of his jacket and\\nof his trowsers were stuffed with raisins; and at the bottom of his\\npocket, when they were emptied by the master-at-arms, was found the\\nsquirt.\\n\\nAs soon as the hue and cry was over, and all the parties were on the\\nquarter-deck, as the coast was clear, I thought I might as well take\\nadvantage of it; and therefore I came out from my hiding-place, went\\ninto the steward\\'s room, filled my handkerchief with raisins, and\\nescaped to the berth unperceived; so that while Tommy Dott was\\ndisgorging on the quarter-deck, I was gorging below.\\n\\nMr Dott was reported to the captain for this heinous offence; and, in\\nconsequence, was ordered below under arrest, his place in the captain\\'s\\ngig being filled up by me; so that in every point of view Tommy\\nsuffered, and I reaped the harvest.  What pleased me most was, that,\\nbeing midshipman of the captain\\'s boat, I was of course continually in\\nthe company of the coxswain, Bob Cross.\\n\\nBut I must not delay at present, as I have to record a very serious\\nadventure which occurred, and by which I, for a long while, was\\nseparated from my companions and shipmates.\\n\\nIn ten days we sailed in search of a pirate vessel, which was reported\\nto have committed many dreadful excesses, and had become the terror of\\nthe mercantile navy.  Our orders were to proceed northward, and to\\ncruise off the Virgin Islands, near which she was said to have been last\\nseen.\\n\\nAbout three weeks after we had left Carlisle Bay, the look-out man\\nreported two strange sail from the mast-head.  I was sent up, as signal\\nmid, to examine them, and found that they were both schooners, hove to\\nclose together; one of them very rakish in their appearance.  All sail\\nin chase was made immediately, and we came up within three miles of\\nthem, when one, evidently the pirate we were in search of, made sail,\\nwhile the other remained hove to.\\n\\nAs we passed the vessel hove to, which we took it for granted was a\\nmerchantman, which the pirate had been plundering, the captain ordered\\none of the cutters to be lowered down with a midshipman and boat\\'s crew\\nto take possession of her.  The men were all in the boat, but the\\nmidshipman had gone down for his spy-glass, or something else, and as it\\nwas merely with a view of ascertaining what the vessel was, and the\\nchief object was to overtake the pirate vessel, to prevent the delay\\nwhich was caused by the other midshipman not being ready, Mr Hippesley\\nordered me to go into the boat instead of him, and, as soon as I was on\\nboard of the schooner, to make sail and follow the frigate.\\n\\nThe captain did say, \"He is too young, Mr Hippesley; is he not?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d sooner trust him than many older, sir,\" was the reply of the first\\nlieutenant.  \"Jump in, Mr Keene.\"  I did so, with my telescope in my\\nhand.  \"Lower away, my lads--unhook, and sheer off;\" and away went the\\nfrigate in pursuit of the pirate vessel, leaving me in the boat, to go\\non board of the schooner.\\n\\nWe were soon alongside, and found that there was not a soul on board of\\nthe vessel; what had become of the crew, whether they had been murdered,\\nor not, it was impossible to say, but there were a few drops of blood on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nThe vessel was an American, bound to one of the islands, with shingle\\nand fir planks; not only was her hold full, but the fir planks were\\npiled up on each side of the deck, between the masts, to the height of\\nfive or six feet.  The pirate had, apparently, been taking some of the\\nplanks on board for her own use.\\n\\nWe dropped the boat astern, let draw the foresheet, and made sail after\\nthe frigate, which was now more than a mile from us, and leaving us very\\nfast.\\n\\nThe schooner was so over-loaded that she sailed very badly, and before\\nthe evening closed in, we could just perceive the top-gallant sails of\\nthe Calliope above the horizon: but this we thought little of, as we\\nknew that as soon as she had captured the pirate she would run back\\nagain, and take us out.\\n\\nThere were some hams and other articles on board, for the pirates had\\nnot taken everything, although the lockers had been all broken open, and\\nthe articles were strewed about in every direction in the cabin and on\\nthe deck.\\n\\nJust before dark, we took the bearings of the frigate, and stood the\\nsame course as she was doing, and then we sat down to a plentiful meal\\nto which we did justice.  I then divided the boat\\'s crew into watches,\\nwent down into the cabin, and threw myself on the standing bed-place, of\\nwhich there was but one, with all my clothes on; the men who had not the\\nwatch went down, and turned in in the cuddy forward, where the seamen\\nusually sleep.\\n\\nIt was not till past midnight that I could obtain any sleep; the heat\\nwas excessive, and I was teased by the cockroaches, which appeared to\\nswarm in the cabin to an incredible degree, and were constantly running\\nover my face and body.  I little thought then why they swarmed.  I\\nrecollect that I dreamt of murder, and tossing men overboard; and then\\nof the vessel being on fire and after that, I felt very cool and\\ncomfortable, and I dreamed no more; I thought that I heard a voice\\ncalling my name: it appeared that I did hear it in my sleep, but I slept\\non.\\n\\nAt last I turned round, and felt a splashing as of water, and some water\\ncoming into my mouth: I awoke.  All was dark and quiet; I put my hand\\nout, and I put it into the water--where was I--was I overboard?  I\\njumped up in my fright; I found that was still on the standing\\nbed-place, but the water was above the mattress.\\n\\nI immediately comprehended that the vessel was sinking, and I called\\nout, but there was no reply.\\n\\nI turned out of the bed-place, and found myself up to my neck in water,\\nwith my feet on the cabin-deck.  Half swimming, and half floundering, I\\ngained the ladder, and went up the hatchway.\\n\\nIt was still quite dark, and I could not perceive nor hear anybody.  I\\ncalled out but there was no reply.  I then was certain that the men had\\nleft the vessel when they round her sinking, and had left me to sink\\nwith her.  I may as well here observe, that when the men had found the\\nwater rising upon them forward they had rushed on deck in a panic,\\ntelling the man at the wheel that the vessel was sinking, and had\\nimmediately hauled up the boat to save their lives; but they did\\nrecollect me, and the coxswain of the boat had come down in the cabin by\\nthe ladder, and called me: but the cabin was full of water, and he,\\nreceiving no answer, considered that I was drowned, and returned on\\ndeck.\\n\\nThe boat had then shoved off, and I was left to my fate; still I hoped\\nthat such was not the case, and I hallooed again and again, but in vain,\\nand I thought it was all over with me.  It was a dreadful position to be\\nin.  I said my prayers and prepared to die, and yet I thought it was\\nhard to die at fifteen years old.\\n\\nAlthough I do not consider that my prayers were of much efficacy, for\\nthere was but little resignation in them, praying had one good effect--\\nit composed me, and I began to think whether there was any chance of\\nbeing saved.\\n\\nYes, there were plenty of planks on the deck, and if it were daylight I\\ncould tie them together and make a raft, which would bear me up.  How I\\nlonged for daylight, for I was afraid that the vessel would sink before\\nI could see to do what was requisite.  The wind had become much fresher\\nduring the night, and the waves now dashed against the sides of the\\nwater-logged vessel.\\n\\nAs I watched for daylight, I began to reflect how this could have\\nhappened; and it occurred to me that the pirates had scuttled the bottom\\nof the vessel to sink her; and in this conjecture I was right.\\n\\nAt last a faint light appeared in the east, which soon broke into broad\\nday, and I lost no time in setting about my work.\\n\\nBefore I began, however, I thought it advisable to ascertain how much\\nmore water there was in the vessel since I had quitted the cabin which\\nit appeared to me must have been about two hours.  I therefore went down\\nin the cabin to measure it.  I know how high it was when I waded through\\nit.  I found, to my surprise, and, I may say, to my joy, that it was not\\nhigher than it was before.\\n\\nI thought that perhaps I might be mistaken, so I marked the height of\\nthe water at the cabin ladder, and I sat down on deck to watch it; it\\nappeared to me not to rise any higher.\\n\\nThis made me reflect, and it then struck me that, as the vessel was\\nladen with timber, she would not probably sink any lower, so I deferred\\nmy work till I had ascertained the fact.\\n\\nThree hours did I watch, and found that the water did not rise higher,\\nand I was satisfied; but the wind increased, and the vessel\\'s sails,\\ninstead of flapping to the wind as she drove without any one at the\\nhelm, were now bellied out, and the vessel careened to leeward.\\n\\nI was afraid that she would turn over; and finding an axe on the deck, I\\nmounted the rigging with it, and commenced cutting away the lacing of\\nthe sails from the mast.  I then lowered the gaffs, and cleared away the\\ncanvass in the same way, so that the sails fell on the deck.  This was a\\nwork of at least one hour; but when the canvass was off, the vessel was\\nsteady.\\n\\nIt was well that I had taken this precaution; for very soon afterwards\\nthe wind was much fresher, and the weather appeared very threatening;\\nthe sea also rose considerably.  I was very tired, and sat down for some\\ntime on the deck abaft.\\n\\nIt then occurred to me that the weight of the planks upon the deck must\\nnot only keep the vessel deeper in the water, but make her more\\ntop-heavy, and I determined to throw them overboard; but first I looked\\nfor something to eat, and found plenty of victuals in the iron pot in\\nwhich the men had cooked their supper the night before.\\n\\nAs soon as I had obtained from the cask lashed on the deck a drink of\\nwater, to wash down the cold fried ham which I had eaten, I set work to\\nthrow overboard the planks on deck.\\n\\nWhen I had thrown over a portion from one side I went to the other, and\\nthrew over as many more, that I might, as much as possible, keep the\\nvessel on an even keel.\\n\\nThis job occupied me the whole of the day; and when I had completed my\\ntask I examined the height of the water at the cabin ladder, and found\\nthat the vessel had risen more than six inches.  This was a source of\\ngreat comfort to me, and what pleased me more was, that the wind had\\ngone down again, and the water was much smoother.\\n\\nI made a supper off some raw ham, for the fire had been extinguished,\\nand committing myself to the protection of Heaven, lay down as the sun\\nset, and from the fatigue of the day was soon in a sound sleep.\\n\\nI awoke about the middle of the night.  The stars shone brightly, and\\nthere was but a slight ripple on the water.\\n\\nI thought of my mother, of my aunt Milly, of Captain Delmar, and I felt\\nfor the seal-skin pouch which was fastened round my neck.  It was all\\nsafe.\\n\\nI calculated chances, and I made up my mind that I should be picked up\\nby some vessel or another before long.\\n\\nI said to myself--\"Why, I am better off now than I was when in the\\nwherry, with Peggy Pearson; I was saved then, why should I not be now?\"\\n\\nI felt no desponding, and lay down, and was soon fast asleep.\\n\\nIt was broad daylight when I awoke; I took my spy-glass, and looking\\nround the horizon, discovered a vessel several miles off, standing\\ntowards me.  This gave me fresh spirits.\\n\\nI made a raw breakfast, and drank plenty of water as before.  The wind,\\nwhich was very light, increased a little.  The vessel came nearer, and I\\nmade her out to be a schooner.  In two hours she was close to me, and I\\nwaved my hat, and hallooed as loud as I could.\\n\\nThe schooner was full of men, and steered close to me--she was a\\nbeautiful craft, and, although the wind was so light, glided very fast\\nthrough the water, and I could not help thinking that she was the pirate\\nvessel which the frigate had been in chase of.\\n\\nIt appeared as if they intended to pass me, and I hallooed, \"Schooner,\\nahoy!  Why don\\'t you send a boat on board?\"\\n\\nI must say, that when the idea struck me that she was a pirate vessel,\\nmy heart almost failed me.\\n\\nShortly afterwards the schooner rounded to and lowered a boat, which\\npulled to the vessel.  The boat\\'s crew were all negroes.\\n\\nOne of them said, \"Jump in, you white boy; next jump he take be into the\\nshark\\'s mouth,\" continued the man, grinning, as he addressed himself to\\nthe others in the boat.\\n\\nI got into the boat, and they rowed on board the schooner.  I did then\\nthink that I was done for; for what mercy could I expect, being a king\\'s\\nofficer, from pirates, which the words of the negro convinced me they\\nwere?\\n\\nAs soon as I was alongside of the schooner, they ordered me to go up the\\nside, which I did, with my spy-glass in my hand.  I leaped from the\\ngunwale down on the deck, and found myself on board of an armed vessel,\\nwith a crew wholly composed of blacks.\\n\\nI was rudely seized by two of them, who led me aft to where a negro\\nstood apart from the rest.  A more fierce, severe, determined-looking\\ncountenance, I never beheld.  He was gigantic in stature and limbed like\\nthe Farnesian Hercules.\\n\\n\"Well, boy, who are you?\" said he, \"and how came you on board of that\\nvessel?\"\\n\\nI told him in very few words.\\n\\n\"Then you belong to that frigate that chased us the day before\\nyesterday?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"What is her name?\"\\n\\n\"The Calliope.\"\\n\\n\"She sails well,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"she is the fastest sailer on this station.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all the information I want of you, boy: now you may go.\"\\n\\n\"Go where?\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Go where?--go overboard, to be sure,\" replied he, with a grin.\\n\\nMy heart died within me; but I mustered courage enough to say, \"Much\\nobliged to you, sir; but I\\'d rather stay where I am, if it\\'s all the\\nsame to you.\"\\n\\nThe other negroes laughed at this reply, and I felt a little confidence;\\nat all events, their good-humour gave me courage, and I felt that being\\nbold was my only chance.\\n\\nThe negro captain looked at me for a time, as if considering, and at\\nlast said to the men, \"Overboard with him.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir, you\\'re very kind,\" said I; \"but this is a capital\\nspy-glass, and I leave it to you as a legacy.\"  And I went up to him and\\noffered him my spy-glass.  Merciful Heaven! bow my heart beat against my\\nribs when I did this!\\n\\nThe negro captain took the glass, and looked through it.\\n\\n\"It is a good glass,\" said he, as he removed it from his eyes.  It was\\npoor Green\\'s spy-glass, which he had given me for showing him the\\nmason\\'s signs.\\n\\n\"Well, white boy, I accept your present; and now, good bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, sir.  Do me one kindness in return,\" said I, very gravely,\\nfor I felt my hour was come.\\n\\n\"And what is that?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"Tie a shot to my heels, that I may sink quickly; it won\\'t take them\\nlong.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t ask me to spare your life, then?\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"He de very first white dat not ask it,\" said one of the negroes.\\n\\n\"Dat really for true,\" said another.\\n\\n\"Yes, by gum,\" replied a third.\\n\\nOh, how I wished to know what to say at that moment!  The observations\\nof the negroes made me imagine that I had better not _ask_ for it and\\nyet how I clung to life!  It was an awful moment--I felt as if I had\\nlived a year in a few minutes.  For a second or two I felt faint and\\ngiddy--I drew a long breath and revived.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t answer me, boy,\" said the negro captain.\\n\\n\"Why should I ask when I feel certain to be refused?  If you will give\\nme my life, I will thank you: I don\\'t particularly wish to die, I can\\nassure you.\"\\n\\n\"I have taken an oath never to spare a white man.  For once I am sorry\\nthat I cannot break my oath.\"\\n\\n\"If that is all, I am a boy, and not a man,\" replied I.  \"Keep me till I\\ngrow bigger.\"\\n\\n\"By golly, captain, that very well said.  Keep him, captain,\" said one\\nof the negroes.\\n\\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied another; \"keep him to tend your cabin.  Proper\\nyou have white slave boy.\"\\n\\nThe negro captain for some time made no reply; he appeared to be in deep\\nthought.  At last he said--\\n\\n\"Boy, you have saved your life: you may thank yourself and not me.\\nProssa, let him be taken below; give him a frock and trousers and throw\\nthat infernal dress overboard, or I may change my resolution.\"\\n\\nThe negro who was addressed, and who wore a sort of uniform as an\\nofficer--which he was, being second mate--led me below,--nothing loth, I\\ncan assure my readers.\\n\\nWhen I was between decks.  I sat down upon a chest, my head swam, and I\\nfainted.  The shock had been too powerful for a lad of my age.  They\\nbrought water, and recovered me.  When I revived, I felt that I might\\nhave lost in their good opinion by thus knowing my weakness; and I had\\nsufficient presence of mind to ask for something to eat.  This deceived\\nthem; they said to one another that I must have been on board that\\nvessel for two days without food, and of course I did not deny it.\\n\\nThey brought me some meat and some grog.  I ate and drank a little.\\nThey then took off my uniform, and put on me a check frock and white\\ntrousers; after which, I said I wished to lie down a little, and they\\nleft me to sleep on the chest where I had been seated.\\n\\nI pretended to sleep, although I could not; and I found out by their\\nconversation that I gained the goodwill not only of the crew, but of the\\ncaptain, by my behaviour.\\n\\nI considered that I had gained my life, at least for the present; but\\nwhat security could I have in such company?\\n\\nAfter an hour or two I felt quite recovered, and I thought it advisable\\nto go on deck.  I did so, and went right aft to the negro captain, and\\nstood before him.\\n\\n\"Well, boy,\" said he, \"why do you come to me?\"\\n\\n\"You gave me my life; you\\'re the greatest friend I have here, so I come\\nto you.  Can I do anything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; you may assist in the cabin, if your white blood does not curdle\\nat the idea of attending on a black man.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all.  I will do anything for them who are kind to me, as you\\nhave been.\"\\n\\n\"And think it no disgrace?\"\\n\\n\"Not the least.  Is it a disgrace to be grateful?\"\\n\\nThe reader will observe how particularly judicious my replies were,\\nalthough but fifteen years old.  My dangerous position had called forth\\nthe reflection and caution of manhood.\\n\\n\"Go down into the cabin; you may amuse yourself till I come.\"\\n\\nI obeyed this order.  The cabin was fitted up equal to most yachts, with\\nSpanish mahogany and gold mouldings; a beaufet full of silver (there was\\nno glass) occupied nearly one-half of it; even the plates and dishes\\nwere of the same material.  Silver candelabras hung down from the middle\\nof the beams; a variety of swords, pistols, and other weapons were fixed\\nup against the bulkhead; a small bookcase, chiefly of Spanish books,\\noccupied the after-bulkhead, and the portraits of several white females\\nfilled up the intervals; a large table in the centre, a stand full of\\ncharts, half a dozen boxes of cigars, and two most luxurious sofas,\\ncompleted the furniture.\\n\\nA door from the starboard side led, I presumed, to the stateroom, where\\nthe captain slept; but I did not venture to open it.\\n\\nI surveyed all this magnificence, wondering who this personage could be;\\nand more still, how it was that the whole of the crew were, as well as\\nthe captain, of the negro race.\\n\\nWe had heard that the pirate we were in search of was a well-known\\ncharacter--a Spaniard--who went by the name of Chico, and that his crew\\nconsisted of Americans, English, and Spaniards.  That this was the\\nvessel, I knew, from the conversation of the men when I was below for\\nthey called her the Stella.\\n\\nNow, it appeared that the vessel had changed masters; the crew were\\nchiefly Spanish negroes, or other negroes who spoke Spanish, but some of\\nthem spoke English, and a few words of Spanish; these, I presumed, were\\nAmerican or English runaways.  But the captain--his language was as\\ncorrect as my own; Spanish he spoke fluently, for I heard him giving\\norders in that language while I was in the cabin; neither was he\\nflat-nosed, like the majority.  Had he been white, his features would\\nhave been considered regular, although there was a fierceness about them\\nat times which was terrible to look at.\\n\\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"if I live and do well, I shall know more about it;\\nyes, if I live, I wish I was on the quarterdeck of the Calliope, even as\\nTommy was with his pockets stuffed full of the purser\\'s raisins, and\\nlooking like a fool and a rogue at the same time.\"\\n\\nI had been down in the cabin about half an hour, when the negro captain\\nmade his appearance.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose you would as soon see the devil as me--eh,\\nboy?\"\\n\\n\"No: indeed,\" replied I, laughing--for I had quite recovered my\\nconfidence--\"for you were about to send me to the devil, and I feel most\\nhappy that I still remain with you.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re exactly the cut of boy I like,\" replied he, smiling.  \"How I\\nwish that you were black!--I detest your colour.\"\\n\\n\"I have no objection to black my face, if you wish it,\" replied I: \"it\\'s\\nall the same to me what colour I am.\"\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"I was fifteen a few months back.\"\\n\\n\"How long have you been to sea?\"\\n\\n\"About eighteen months.\"\\n\\nHe then asked me a great many more questions, about the captain, the\\nofficers, the ship, and myself; to all of which I answered in a guarded\\nway.\\n\\nA negro brought down his supper; it was hot, and very savoury; without\\nany order on his part, I immediately attended upon him during his meal.\\nHe told the negro not to wait and conversed with me during the time that\\nhe was eating: at last, he told me how he had doubled the frigate during\\nthe night.  I then remarked that we had been informed that the vessel\\nwas called the Stella, that the captain\\'s name was Chico, and the crew\\nwere composed of white men of different nations.\\n\\n\"A month or two ago, it was the case,\" replied the captain.  \"Now I have\\ndone, and you may clear away,\" continued he, rising from his chair and\\nthrowing himself down on one of the sofas.  \"Stop; you are hungry, I\\ndon\\'t doubt; you can sit down and eat your supper, and remove the things\\nafterwards.\"\\n\\nI did as he told me: it was the first time in my life I had supped off\\nmassive plate--but I was in strange company; however, it did not spoil\\nmy appetite, and I did not forget to drink a goblet of wine by way of\\nwashing down my repast.\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said I, rising, and then performing my office of\\nattendant.\\n\\nAt his order, I rang the bell for the negro, who assisted me in clearing\\naway, and then went out with the remains of the supper.\\n\\n\"Am I to stay or go?\" said I, respectfully.\\n\\n\"You may go now.  Find the man who came in just now--Jose he is called;\\ntell him to give you something to sleep upon.\"\\n\\n\"Good-night, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Good-night, boy.\"\\n\\nAs I went forward looking for the negro servant, I was accosted more\\nthan once very kindly by the negro seamen.  At last I went up on the\\nforecastle, and they asked me to tell them how I was left on board the\\nschooner.  I did so to those who spoke English, and one of them, who\\ncould speak both languages, translated into Spanish for the benefit of\\nthe others.\\n\\n\"You be first white he hab spared, I tell you,\" said the American negro,\\nwho had translated into Spanish what I had told them, after the other\\nhad left me with him.\\n\\n\"The captain says he wishes I were black,\" said I to the negro; \"I wish\\nI was, too, while I am on board of this vessel--my colour makes him\\nangry, I see that.  Could not I be stained black?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do think it will be a very safe thing for you, if it could be;\\nfor you have not seen him sometimes in his moods; and if to-morrow\\nmorning he was chased and hard pressed by the frigate, you would stand a\\npoor chance, suppose his eyes light upon you.  I can\\'t tink what make\\nhim to let you off, only but cause you give him de spy-glass in dat hold\\nway.  I tink I know a chap on board who understand dat--I go see--you\\nwait here till I come back.\"\\n\\nThe negro left me, and in a few minutes returned, with a sort of\\nhalf-Indian, half-negro-looking cut of fellow, with whom he conversed in\\nSpanish.\\n\\n\"He say he know how to make brown like himself but not dark same as me.\\nSuppose you wish he do it to-night--begin now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do wish it,\" replied I; and so I did sincerely, for I felt that\\nit might be the saving of my life; and I had a great aversion to be torn\\nto pieces by the sharks which followed the vessel, that being anything\\nbut an agreeable mode of going out of the world.\\n\\nThe American black remained with me, and we conversed for about half an\\nhour, by which time we were joined by the Spanish Main negro, who\\nbrought up with him some decoction or another, boiling hot.  They\\nstripped me and rubbed me all over with a bit of sponge, not only the\\nface and hands, but every part of my body and then I was left standing\\nquite naked to dry; the crew had gathered round us, and were very merry\\nat the idea of changing my colour.\\n\\nAs soon as the warm air had dried me, the application was created; and\\nwhen I was again dry, the American told me to put on my clothes, and\\nthat he would call me early to have two more applications of the stuff,\\nand that then I should be quite dark enough.\\n\\nI asked for Jose, and told him what the captain had said; he gave me a\\nbundle of matting for a bed, and I was soon fast asleep.  About three\\no\\'clock in the morning I was called up, and the staining repeated twice,\\nand I then lay down again.\\n\\nWhen the hands were turned up at five bells (for everything was very\\nregular on board), Jose brought me a glass to look at myself, and I was\\nquite satisfied that my colour would no longer annoy the captain.  I was\\nnot as black as a negro, but I was as dark as a mulatto.\\n\\nI asked the Spanish negro, through Jose, who could speak both languages,\\nwhether I might wash myself?  He replied, all day long if I pleased;\\nthat I should not get the colour off; it would wear off in time, and the\\nstuff must be applied once a month, and that would be sufficient.\\n\\nI went to the forecastle, and washed myself; the negro crew were much\\namused, and said that I now was a \"bel muchaco\"--a handsome boy.  I dare\\nsay they thought so--at all events, they appeared to be very friendly\\nwith me, and my staining myself gave them great satisfaction.  I was\\nsitting with Jose between decks when the cabin bell rang.\\n\\n\"You go,\" said he, showing his white teeth as he grinned; \"I go after,\\nsee what captain tink.\"\\n\\nI went into the cabin, and knocked at the state-room door.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" said the captain.\\n\\nI went in, and met him face to face.\\n\\n\"What!\" said he, looking earnestly at me--\"yet it must be--it is you, is\\nit not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I, \"it is me.  I\\'ve turned dark to please you, and I\\nhope it does please you.\"\\n\\n\"It does, boy, I can look at you now, and forget that you are white.  I\\ncan.  I feel that I can love you now--you\\'ve got rid of your only fault\\nin my eyes, and I\\'m not sorry.  I\\'m only glad that I did not--\"\\n\\n\"Give me to the sharks,\" said I, finishing his sentence.\\n\\n\"Exactly so; say no more about it.\"\\n\\nI immediately turned the conversation, by asking him what he required;\\nand I attended him while dressing.  From that time he became very\\nfriendly towards me, constantly conversing with me.  I did my duty as\\nhis servant for more than a fortnight, during which time we became very\\nintimate, and (I may as well confess it) I grew very fond of my new\\nmaster, and thought less about the ship and my shipmates.  We were going\\ninto a port, I knew, but what port I did not know.\\n\\nI often had conversations with Jose and the American black, and gained a\\ngreat deal of information from them; but I could not discover much of\\nthe history of the captain.  On that point they refused to be\\ncommunicative; occasionally hints were given, and then, as if\\nrecollecting themselves, they stopped speaking.\\n\\nIt was about three weeks before we made the land of Cuba, and as soon as\\nwe did so, the schooner was hove to till night, when sail was again\\nmade, and before ten o\\'clock we saw the lights of the Havannah.  When\\nabout three miles off we again hove to, and about midnight we perceived\\nunder the land the white sails of a schooner, which was standing out.\\nSail was made, and we ran down to her, and before she was aware that we\\nwere an enemy, she was laid by the board and in the possession of our\\ncrew.  The people belonging to the vessel were handed up, and she was\\nexamined.  She proved to be a vessel fitted out for the slave trade,\\nwith the manacles, etcetera, on board of her, and was just sailing for\\nthe coast.\\n\\nI was on the deck when the white men, belonging to the slaver, were\\nbrought on board, and never shall I forget the rage and fury of the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nAll sail was made upon both schooners, standing right off from the land,\\nand at daylight we had left it a long way astern.\\n\\nJose said to me, \"You better not go to captain dis day.  Keep out of his\\nway--perhaps he recollect dat you white.\"\\n\\nFrom what I had seen the night before, I thought this good advice; and I\\nnot only did not go into the cabin, but I did not show myself on deck.\\n\\nAbout eight o\\'clock in the morning I heard the boat lowered down and\\norders given to scuttle the vessel, as soon as she had been well\\nsearched.  This was done, and the boat returned, having found several\\nthousand dollars on board of her, which they handed upon deck.\\n\\nI remained below: I heard the angry voice of the negro captain--the\\npleadings and beggings for mercy of the prisoners--busy preparations\\nmaking on deck; and several men came down and handed up buckets of sand;\\nan iron grating was handed up.  The countenances of the negroes who were\\nthus employed appeared inflamed, as if their wrath was excited; now and\\nthen they laughed at each other, and looked more like demons than men.\\nThat some dreadful punishment was about to be inflicted I was certain\\nand I remained crouched behind the foremast on the lower-deck.\\n\\nAt last the men were all on deck again, and I was left alone; and then I\\nheard more noise, begging for mercy, weeping and wailing, and\\noccasionally a few words from the mouth of the negro captain; then rose\\nshrieks and screams, and appeals to Heaven, and a strong smell, which I\\ncould not comprehend, came down the hatchways.\\n\\nThe shrieks grew fainter, and at last ceased, and something was thrown\\noverboard.  Then the same tragedy, whatever it was, was acted over\\nagain--more attempts to obtain mercy--more shrieks--again the same\\noverpowering smell.  What could it be?  I would have given much to know,\\nbut something told me that I must remain where I was.  Ten times was\\nthis repeated, and then, as evening came on, there was a bustle on deck,\\nand after a time the crew descended the hatchways.\\n\\nI caught the eye of the American, with whom I was intimate, and as he\\npassed me, I beckoned to him.  He came to me.\\n\\n\"What has been done?\" said I in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Captain punish slave traders,\" replied he; \"always punish them so.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what did he do to them?\"\\n\\n\"Do?--roast \\'em alive.  Dis third slave vessel he take, and he always\\nserve \\'em so.  Serve \\'em right; captain very savage; no go to him till\\nmorrow morning--you keep close.\"  So saying, the American negro left me.\\n\\nAs I afterwards found out, the long boat on the booms had been cleared\\nout, the sand laid at the bottom to prevent the fire from burning the\\nboat, the captain and crew of the slave vessel laid on one after the\\nother upon the iron grating, and burnt alive.  This accounted for the\\nhorrible smell that had come down the hatchways.\\n\\nIt may be considered strange that I really did not feel so much horror\\nas perhaps I ought to have done.  Had this dreadful punishment been\\ninflicted upon any _other_ persons than slave dealers, and _by_ any\\nother parties than negroes, I should not have been able to look at the\\ncaptain without abhorrence expressed in my countenance; but I know well\\nthe horrors of the slave trade from conversation I had had with Bob\\nCross; and I had imbibed such a hatred against the parties who had\\ncarried it on, that it appeared to me to be an act of retaliation almost\\nallied to justice.  Had the negro captain only warred against slave\\ndealers, I do not think I should have cared about remaining in the\\nvessel; but he had told me and fully proved to me, that he detested all\\nwhite men, and had never spared them except in my own instance.\\n\\nI must acknowledge that I felt very much like going into the lion\\'s den,\\nwhen the next morning, on his ringing the cabin bell, I presented myself\\nto the captain; but so far from being in an ill-humour, he was very kind\\nto me.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, as I was going out, he said to me, \"You must have a\\nname: I shall call you Cato--recollect that; and now I have a question\\nto ask you--What is that which you carry round your neck on a ribbon?\"\\n\\n\"A letter, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"A letter! and why do you carry a letter?\"\\n\\n\"Because it is of the greatest importance to me.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!  Now, Cato, sit down on the other sofa, and let me know your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\nI felt that I could not do better than to make this man at once my\\nconfidant.  He might take a strong interest in me, and it was not likely\\nto go farther.  I therefore told him everything connected with my birth\\nand parentage, what my suspicions had been, and how the letter had\\nconfirmed them.  I unsewed the seal-skin, and gave him the letter to\\nread--without being aware that he could read: he took it and read it\\naloud.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"that\\'s proof under his own hand; and now, Cato, never\\nbe afraid of me, for, however I may wreak my vengeance upon others, I\\nswear _by my colour_ that I never will hurt you, or permit others to do\\nso.  I am a tiger--I know it; but you have often seen a little spaniel\\ncaressed by the tiger, whose fangs are turned against every other living\\nthing.  You are quite safe.\"\\n\\n\"I feel I am, since you say so,\" replied I; \"and since I am to be your\\npet, I shall take liberties, and ask you, in return, to tell me your\\nhistory.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad that you have asked it, as I wish you to know it.  I will\\nbegin at once--\\n\\n\"I was born in America, in the state of Pennsylvania, of free parents.\\nMy father was a sail-maker, and was worth money; bet a free black in\\nAmerica is even worse treated and more despised than a slave.  I had two\\nbrothers, who went to school with me.\\n\\n\"My father intended to bring me up for the Church.  You look astonished;\\nbut in the States we have clergymen of our colour, as well as white\\nones; looked down upon and despised, I grant, although they do teach the\\nWord of God; but I was very unfit for that profession, as you may\\nsuppose.  I was very proud and haughty; I felt that I was as good as a\\nwhite man, and I very often got into scrapes from my resenting injuries.\\n\\n\"However, my education went on successfully, much more so than that of\\nmy brothers, who could not learn.  I could, and learnt rapidly but I\\nlearnt to hate and detest white men, and more especially Americans; I\\nbrooded over the injuries of people of colour, as we were called, and\\nall my father\\'s advice and entreaty could not persuade me to keep my\\nthoughts to myself.  As I grew up to manhood, I spoke boldly, and more\\nthan once nearly lost my life for so doing; for most Americans think no\\nmore of taking the life of one like me than of a dog in the street.\\nMore than one knife has been directed to my heart, and more than once\\nwas I then up before the judge, and sentenced to imprisonment for no\\nfault; my evidence, and the evidence of those of my colour, not being\\npermitted to be received in a court of justice.  Any white villain had\\nonly to swear falsely--and there is no want of that class in America--\\nand there was no appeal.  At last I was sentenced to be whipped; then my\\nblood boiled, and I vowed a vengeance which I have fearfully adhered\\nto.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wonder at that,\" said I; \"I would have done the same.\"\\n\\n\"The man who had sworn falsely against me in this last instance had come\\nup from the South; I obtained what money I could from my father, and\\nwent away in pursuit of him.  I found him--dogged him, and one evening I\\naccosted him, and plunged my bowie-knife into his heart.  I fled that\\nState, and crossed the Mississippi.\\n\\n\"I had not been long in Arkansas before a man--a cotton-grower, who\\nowned about a hundred and fifty slaves--inquired who I was, and whether\\nI had a pass; I replied that I was a free man, born in Pennsylvania, and\\nwas there on my own affairs.  The next day I was taken up, brought\\nbefore the magistrate, and this scoundrel swore that I was his slave,\\nand had absconded from him ten years before.\\n\\n\"My defence--the proof which I offered to bring, was not listened to.  I\\nwas made over to him, and the rascal grinned as the constables brought\\nme away with him.  His plantation was at the Red River.  It was\\ndifficult to escape and indeed, almost useless to attempt it: but the\\nfact was, that I did not wish to do so; I remained to have my revenge.\\nI tried to make the other slaves rise against him, but they were too\\ncowed; they even informed against me, and I was tied down, and flogged\\nby the drivers until the flesh fell from my shoulders.\\n\\n\"As soon as I recovered, I determined to do--or die.  I heard that there\\nwere some pirate vessels in the Barataria lagoons on the other side of\\nNew Orleans; I resolved to join the crews, but first to have my revenge.\\nI did so: I set fire to the plantation house--struck the scoundrel who\\nhad made me a slave senseless as he attempted to escape, and threw his\\nbody into the flames; I then made the door fast, and fled.  I was met by\\none of the overseers, who was armed, and who would have stopped me: I\\nbeat his brains out with his own musket, and then gained the woods.  You\\nsee that I am powerful; you hardly know how much so.  After several\\ndays\\' travelling, I arrived at the lagoons.  I found this very vessel at\\nanchor.  I offered myself, and they accepted me immediately.\\n\\n\"There were several of my colour on board--runaway slaves--and all good\\ndetermined men.  These were the people I required, for they understood\\nme.  Even on board of a pirate vessel, the same contempt was shown\\ntowards us--still considered as inferior beings.  All the heavy work all\\nthe dirty work, was for the negro race; and we often worked like slaves,\\nwhile the captain and the rest of the crew caroused.  I was three years\\non board of this vessel.  Our rendezvous where we are going to now, is a\\nsmall land-locked bay on the island of Cuba.  No vessel in it can be\\nseen from seaward, and there is but one narrow pass by which it\\ncommunicates with the interior, and it is far from any habitation.  A\\nbetter retreat for a pirate vessel could not well be found.  We used\\nvery often to go in to refit, and take in provisions and water; for in a\\ncave there, we keep the provisions which we take from other vessels.\\n\\n\"In a desperate fight which we had with an English man-of-war brig, we\\nlost nearly forty of our men.  The captain, Chico, as he was called, was\\nobliged to fill up with black men, until he could procure others.  The\\nconsequence was, that with the ten before on board, there were fifty\\nblacks to seventy whites.  It was then that I made up my mind that I\\nwould retaliate for all that my race had suffered.  I was sure of the\\nten with whom I had sailed so long; I sounded the others, and found them\\nall willing.\\n\\n\"We sailed from the Mexican Gulf, and made for the Rendezvous Bay, in\\nCuba.  As soon as we arrived, of course, as with all pirate vessels, the\\nfirst day was dedicated to revelling and intoxication--that is, by the\\nwhite portion of the crew.  We negroes were employed in getting the\\ncasks ashore for water.  That very night, when they all lay asleep and\\ndrunk, we put every soul of them to death, and the Stella belonged to me\\nand my brave black who chose me for their captain, and swore by their\\nwrongs eternal enmity to the European race.\\n\\n\"As you may suppose, I was short-manned; but we soon found plenty of\\nmen, and have now as fine a crew as ever trod a deck.\"\\n\\n\"How long is it since you took possession of the vessel?\"\\n\\n\"About eight or nine months, during which time I have spared none except\\nyou.  The usual death is drowning; but if I fall in with a slaver,\\nthen--you know what took place yesterday.\"\\n\\nI was silent for a time.  \"I do not wonder,\" said I, at last, \"at your\\nhatred of the whites, especially of the Americans.  As for your wreaking\\nyour vengeance upon those employed in the slave trade, dreadful as it\\nis, I scarcely pity them; but in your general warfare against the\\nwhites, recollect that you may murder those who are your friends, and\\nwho have done all they can to put an end to slavery.  Even in America,\\nthere are many who are opposed to it.\"\\n\\n\"It is impossible to make a distinction,\" replied the negro.\\n\\n\"What is your name?\" said I, musing.\\n\\n\"Why do you ask?  You may as well know; I wish it to be known: it is\\nJames Vincent.\"\\n\\n\"But tell me, if you were to meet with a very superior force, what would\\nyou do?\"\\n\\n\"Run if I could; if not, fight.\"\\n\\n\"But you might be captured, and then--\"\\n\\n\"Never, boy; never.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"as you have begun by sparing me, I hope you will spare\\nothers now.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why I spared you.  Had you shown any fear of death I\\nshould not have done so; but I felt that you would not care about it.  I\\nbelieve it was that.\"\\n\\nAbout ten days after, we made the east end of the island of Cuba, and\\nran into the Bay of Rendezvous, as it was named by the pirate.  It was\\nvery small, but completely land-locked, and the land so high on every\\nside that the masts of the vessel could not be seen from the seaward.\\nThe bay on the land side was met by a deep, narrow ravine, between\\nmountains which were almost perpendicular, the ravine itself being\\naccessible from the main land by only one narrow path known to the\\npirates, and which they seldom made use of, except when a spy was sent\\nto the Havannah to ascertain what vessels were about to sail.\\n\\nOn the high land which shut in the bay from the sea, the pirates had a\\nman constantly on the look-out, to report any vessel which might be in\\nthe offing, and Vincent himself passed much of his time there, as the\\nbreeze was fresh and the air cool to what it was down in the land-locked\\nbay.  I was, for the same reason, very fond of being on the look-out\\nhill, and generally followed up the captain when he went out there.  He\\ncertainly now showed a strong affection for me, and I liked him better\\nthan I ever thought I could have done.  He was constantly telling me of\\nthe treatment he and the other poor blacks had received in America, and\\nI could not help feeling my blood boil, and a conviction that, had I\\nbeen so treated, I should probably have been equally under the influence\\nof revenge.  It is the world, and the treatment we receive from it,\\nwhich makes us chiefly what we are.\\n\\nOne day the captain told me he was going that evening to obtain\\ninformation, as the spy he had sent had returned unsuccessful, and that\\nhe should be absent for three or four days.\\n\\nAlthough I was not discontented with my position, still, as the reader\\nmay well suppose, I had a strong wish to be out of it as soon as\\npossible, and I had determined to escape if I could; it immediately\\noccurred to me, that his absence would give me the opportunity.\\n\\nI replied with a laugh, \"Had you not better take me with you?\"\\n\\n\"Very likely, indeed, you would be so very useful; I shall have quite\\nenough to do to take care of myself; besides, you might betray me,\"\\nadded he, with a fierce and penetrating look.\\n\\n\"Thank you, for your good opinion,\" replied I, indignantly.  \"So you\\nthink, because you have saved my life, that I would take yours.  I am\\nnot yet such a rascal, whatever I may become by keeping bad company.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" replied the negro captain, \"I believe I am wrong, so don\\'t\\nget into a passion; but, at all events, you must see that it is\\nimpossible I can take you with me.\"\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t choose, I can\\'t help it,\" said I; \"but I don\\'t like\\nremaining here without you; I shall run away if I can, so I give you\\nfair warning.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t find that quite so easy,\" replied he, laughing; \"and I\\nrecommend you not to attempt it.\"\\n\\nHere the conversation dropped.  About midnight the captain commenced his\\nascent of the ravine, and I resolved that I would not lose the\\nopportunity, if it offered, of following him.  I watched him as long as\\nI could see him, that I might know the direction of the secret path, and\\nthen I joined the crew, who were lying down by the tents which they had\\npitched on the shore.  Shortly afterwards, the Spanish Indian, who had\\ncoloured me, passed by me, and, as I intended to make the attempt before\\nit was quite dark, I thought that I would remove any suspicion, and I\\ntherefore requested him to stain me again.  This he consented to do, and\\nin half an hour I was again naked among the negroes and undergoing the\\noperation.  Having received the two applications, as before, I then\\nquitted them.\\n\\nAs soon as it was quite dark, I armed myself with a pair of pistols, and\\ncrawled underneath the back of the captain\\'s tent, in which I always\\nslept, and, without being perceived, gained the narrow path in the\\nbrushwood by which the captain had left.\\n\\nI continued in the path for some time, by feeling the brushwood on\\neither side; but before I had crawled half way up the ravine, I found\\nthat the brushwood had not been cut away any farther and I was at a loss\\nhow to proceed.  All traces were gone, and all I had to do was to climb\\nup to the summit, and to take my chance of finding any egress.  I toiled\\non with difficulty, sometimes stopped by a rock which would take me\\nminutes to climb over at others, holding on by the brushwood for my\\nlife.  By twelve o\\'clock I had gained more than two-thirds of the\\nascent, and then the moon rose, and assisted me with her light.  I must\\nsay, that when I looked up and saw the rocks towering above me, and\\noverhanging my path, I felt that escape was nearly impossible: however,\\nI recommenced my labour, and gained some ground, when, as I was clinging\\nto the side of a rock by a small shrub, it gave way, and I rolled and\\nfell down many feet, between that rock and another opposite to it.\\n\\nI was not much hurt, and I regained my legs.  Looking up and about me, I\\nfound that I was in a narrow passage, between the rocks, leading both up\\nand down--in fact, I had tumbled into the secret path that I had been in\\nsearch of.  Delighted with this discovery, I now set off with great\\nspirit, and in half an hour found myself on the other side of the lull\\nwhich formed the ravine, and looking down upon an expanse of country in\\nthe interior.  Being very tired, I sat down, that I might recover my\\nstrength before I continued my journey.\\n\\n\"I am free at last,\" thought I, and my memory wandered back to my mother\\nmy ship, and my captain--old Culpepper, Tommy Dott, and Bob Cross.  \"I\\nshall see them all,\" I thought, \"and what a story I shall have to tell.\"\\nAs soon as I had rested myself and recovered my breath, I thought I\\nmight as well start.\\n\\nI had not proceeded more than a hundred yards before I thought heard a\\nnoise, as if some one was approaching.  I listened--I felt sure that\\nsuch was the case, and I also heard the deep baying of a hound.  The\\nnoise increased rapidly--it was that of one forcing his way through the\\nbrushwood, which covered the side of the hill.\\n\\nIn a minute afterwards I perceived a man coming up the hill at a swift\\npace, directly towards me.  As he approached I could almost swear that\\nit was Vincent, the negro captain; but when within ten yards of me, I\\nperceived, him turn round and flourish his sabre in the air, while, at\\nthe same time, three large bloodhounds sprang at him.  One fell by the\\nblow of his sabre, but the other two flew at his throat, and fastened on\\nhim, tearing him to the around, and holding him in spite of all his\\nstruggling and his immense strength.\\n\\nI recollected my pistols: I cocked them, ran up, and putting one to the\\nhead of the nearest dog, blew out its brains.  I was equally successful\\nwith the other--they both lay dead by his side, and Vincent was\\nreleased.  He started up.\\n\\n\"It is me, Cato,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Cato!\" replied he; \"but there is not a moment to be lost.  I understand\\nit all.\"\\n\\nHe seized me by the arm, and dragged me with him to the narrow entrance\\nof the pass, and as soon as we came in he rolled three large rocks,\\nwhich had evidently been used for such purpose before, so as completely\\nto block up the entrance.\\n\\n\"There,\" said he, leaning back quite exhausted; \"be quiet, Cato.  We are\\nsafe now; they will be on the top of the hill directly.\"\\n\\nWe remained where we were about ten minutes, when we heard voices not\\nvery far from us.  They were the pursuers of the negro captain who were\\nevidently baffled.  After a time the sounds receded from us, and we\\nheard them no more.  Vincent then spoke:--\\n\\n\"You were escaping, Cato.\"\\n\\n\"I had escaped,\" replied I: \"I told you that I would.\"\\n\\n\"Strange that you should have discovered the path; did any one betray it\\nto you?\"\\n\\n\"No one,\" replied I: and I then told him how I had fallen into it.\\n\\n\"Well you have returned all obligations, and more than ever you owed\\nme,\" said he: \"you have saved my life this time, and that when all\\nchance was over.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" replied I, \"although I shall be very sorry to part with you,\\ngive me that liberty which I had gained, and which I lost in defending\\nyou from the dogs.\"\\n\\n\"I would have let you go then, Cato,\" replied he, \"but your life would\\nhave been sacrificed.  My pursuers would have hurried you to prison\\nbefore you could have explained who you were.  You forget your colour is\\nchanged; they were not seeking me, but a runaway slave, and the\\nbloodhounds came upon my track.  Those white men show no mercy; they\\nhave more pleasure in seeing a runaway slave torn to pieces by those\\ndogs than in recovering possession of him.  It is a sort of fox-chase to\\nthem,\" continued he, grating his teeth after he had said so.  \"Cato, I\\nwill give you your liberty, if you wish it, and I know you do wish it,\\nas soon as I can with any prudence; that I promise you, and you know\\nthat I will keep my word.\"\\n\\n\"I am quite satisfied,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"And do you promise me that you will not attempt to escape a second\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\"I promise you that I will not,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Enough,\" said Vincent.  \"Now let us go down the hill, for I am very\\nmuch torn by those infernal brutes, and must have the wounds washed and\\nattended to.\"\\n\\nWe descended the hill, in silence, and in a quarter of an hour had\\ngained the tent.  Vincent was severely bitten and torn: as soon as his\\nwounds had been dressed he lay down on his mat, and I did the same.\\n\\nIt was some days before Vincent recovered from the severe injuries which\\nhe had received from the bloodhounds; and he did not appear to be\\ninclined to run any more risks of that sort.  Although he said little, I\\ncould perceive that he was brooding over future vengeance and he was now\\nnearly the whole of the day with his glass on the look-out hill.\\n\\nOne morning a schooner hove in sight, steering from the Havannah to the\\nsouthward and eastward, either for the islands of the Spanish Main.  The\\nStella had for many days been ready for instant sailing, and having\\nwatched her till near sunset, Vincent sent down orders for every soul to\\nbe on board, and the anchor hove up.  Just as it was dark we towed out\\nof the bay, and made all sail.\\n\\nAt daylight the schooner was but a few miles ahead of us and not being a\\nfast sailer, in little more than an flour we were alongside of her.  She\\nproved to be bound to the island of Curacao, being the property of an\\nold Dutch gentleman, who was on board with his daughter, a little girl\\nabout seven years old.  The crew consisted chiefly of negroes, slaves to\\nthe owner; the master of the vessel and the mate being, with the\\nexception of the old gentleman and the little girl, the only white\\npeople on board.\\n\\nAs usual, the crew were brought on board by the pirates, who reported to\\nthe captain that the vessel was in ballast, and of no value.  As the\\ncrew of the Stella were already more than requisite, Vincent did not\\nrequire the negroes; he told them that they might go on board the\\nschooner again, and take her into any port they pleased; with the white\\npeople, however it was another affair.\\n\\nI had remained below, not wishing to witness a scene of butchery; but I\\nwas induced to look up the ladder, in consequence of Jose telling me\\nthat there was a little white girl come on board.  At the time that I\\ndid so, Vincent had just done speaking with the negroes belonging to the\\ncaptured vessel; they had fallen back, and there was then standing\\nbefore Vincent, the master and mate of the vessel, the old Dutch\\ngentleman, and the little girl.\\n\\nA more interesting child I never had seen, and my heart bled at the idea\\nof her being sacrificed.  I could not help hoping that Vincent would\\nhave a similar feeling, but I was mistaken.  The master and mate were\\npointed at, and immediately seized by negroes and tossed over into the\\nsea.  The old gentleman bowed his head over the beautiful child, and she\\nknelt to him, as if for his blessing before she died.  At that very\\nmoment Vincent gave the sign--I could remain quiet to longer--I sprang\\non the deck.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried I to the men who were about to seize the old\\ngentleman--\"stop!\"  The negroes did fall back at my voice.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" cried Vincent.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" cried I, \"do you call yourself a man, to war with\\nchildren and old grey-headed men?  You must not, shall not, touch these\\ntwo.  You have wreaked your vengeance upon the white men; be content--\\nlet these go.\"\\n\\n\"Cato,\" replied Vincent, fiercely, \"it is well that it is you that have\\ndared to snatch the prey from the fangs of the wild beast.  Had it been\\nanother, this pistol should have sent a ball whizzing through his brain;\\nas it is, go down below immediately.\"\\n\\n\"I do not fear your pistol, Captain Vincent, nor will I go below; that\\nvery pistol, in my hand, saved you from the fangs of the blood-hound.  I\\ntell you, therefore, that you must not destroy that innocent child--if\\nyou love me, you must not; for I will hate, detest, and scorn you ever\\nafterwards.  I entreat you--I implore you to let them go: they are not\\nfit objects for your vengeance; and if you destroy them, I tell you, you\\nare a coward.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" roared the tiger, \"a coward!\" and, no longer able to contain\\nhimself he levelled his pistol at me and drew the trigger.  It missed\\nfire; Vincent looked very confused--he tossed the pistol on deck, folded\\nhis arms and turned his face away.\\n\\nThere was a dead silence.  The negro crew looked first at me and then at\\nthe captain, as if awaiting orders, and uncertain of the issue.  The\\nDutch gentleman seemed to be so lost in surprise, as to almost forget\\nhis impending fate; while the little girl clung to him and stared at me\\nwith her deep blue eyes.  It was what on the theatres they would call a\\ntableau.\\n\\nI followed up my advantage.  Stepping forward, and placing myself before\\nthe old man and the child, I first broke the silence.\\n\\n\"Captain Vincent,\" said I, \"you did once promise me that you would never\\ninjure me or attempt my life; that promise you have broken.  Since that,\\nyou have made me another promise--you may recollect it--which was, that\\nyou would allow me to leave you on the first favourable opportunity;\\nthere cannot be any opportunity more favourable than the present.  The\\nnegroes whom you are to send back to the schooner do not know how to\\nnavigate her.  I request, therefore, to know whether you intend to keep\\nthis second promise, or to break it as you have the first?  I ask my\\nliberty.\"\\n\\n\"If I broke my promise just now, it was your fault,\" replied Vincent,\\ncoolly.  \"I am sorry for it, and I can say no more; I intended to keep\\nit, and, to prove so, I now keep my second--you may go.\"\\n\\n\"I thank you for that.  I only wish that, now I leave you, I could leave\\nyou with feelings of good-will and not of--I must say it--of horror and\\ndisgust.  Captain Vincent, once more let me beg, as a last favour, that\\nyou will spare these poor people.\"\\n\\n\"Since you are so particularly interested about this useless old man and\\nstill more useless child,\" replied Vincent, sarcastically, \"I will now\\nmake a proposal to you.  You have your liberty.  Do you choose to give\\nit up and remain here, provided I let them go away in the schooner?\\nCome now--take your choice; for I swear by my colour, that if you go\\naway in the schooner, the moment you shove off, they shall go over the\\ngunwale.\"\\n\\n\"My choice is then made,\" replied I; for I knew that when he swore by\\nhis colour he was in earnest: \"release them, and I will remain here.\"  I\\nlittle knew what I was to undergo in consequence of this decision.\\n\\n\"Be it so,\" said Vincent: then turning to one of the mates, \"let them go\\nback with the negroes; hoist the boat up when she returns, and sail for\\nthe Rendezvous.\"  So saying, he went down into the cabin.\\n\\n\"You are saved,\" said I, going up to the old Dutch gentleman; \"lose no\\ntime; get into the boat as fast as possible, and make sail on your\\nvessel as soon as you get on board.  Good bye, little girl,\" said I,\\ntaking her hand.\\n\\n\"I thank you,\" replied the gentleman in good English--\"I cannot say how\\nmuch; I am so surprised at what I have seen but recollect the name of\\nVanderwelt, of Curacao; and if ever we meet again, you will find me\\ngrateful.\"\\n\\n\"I will; but ask no more questions now--into the boat--quick,\" said I,\\nshaking his proffered hand.  They were handed down into the boat by the\\nnegroes.\\n\\nI remained on deck until they were put on board; the boat returned, was\\nhoisted up, the schooner made sail again, and then I went down into the\\ncabin.  I found the negro captain stretched upon the sofa, his face\\ncovered up with both his hands; he remained in the same position, taking\\nno notice of my coming down.  Although my confidence in him was\\ndestroyed after his snapping the pistol at me, yet when I reflected how\\nI had bearded him in his rage, I did make some excuse for him; moreover,\\nI knew that it was my interest to be on the best terms with him, and, if\\npossible, make him forget what had passed, for I felt that his proud\\nspirit would make it difficult for him to forgive himself for having\\nbeen induced by his passion to break an oath which he had sworn to by\\nhis colour; I therefore, after a little reflection, went up to him and\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"I am sorry that I made you so angry, Captain Vincent; you must forgive\\nme, but I thought that deed beneath you, and I could not bear to have a\\nbad opinion of you.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean to assert that you have not a bad opinion of me now?\"\\nreplied he, fixing his eyes upon me.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; you have released those I pleaded for, and I am very\\ngrateful to you for having done so.\"\\n\\n\"You have made me do what I never did before,\" replied he, raising\\nhimself and sitting with his feet on the deck.\\n\\n\"I know I have; I have made you spare those of my colour.\"\\n\\n\"I did not mean that; you have irritated me so as to make me break my\\noath.\"\\n\\n\"That was my own doing--my fault rather than yours.  I had no right to\\nspeak as I did; but I was in a great rage, and that is the truth.  I do\\nbelieve that, if I had had a pistol in my hand, I should have fired it\\nat you; so we may cry quits on that score.\"\\n\\n\"I am angry with myself--the more so, that I little imagined that you\\nwould have remained with me after my breaking my oath.  Either you must\\nhave felt great interest about those people, or you must have great\\nconfidence in me, a confidence winch I have proved that I do not\\ndeserve.\"\\n\\n\"That you did forget yourself, I grant; but I have that confidence that\\nit will be a warning to you, and you will not forget yourself again; I\\ntherefore remain with you with perfect confidence, feeling I am quite\\nsafe, until you think proper to give me my liberty.\"\\n\\n\"You will wish to leave me then?\"\\n\\n\"I have relations and friends--a profession to follow.  What can I gain\\nby remaining here, except your friendship?  I never will be a pirate,\\nyou may be assured, I wish from my heart that you were not one.\"\\n\\n\"And who should be pirates if the blacks are not?\" replied Vincent.\\n\"Have they not the curse of Cain?  Are they not branded?  Ought not\\ntheir hands to be against every one but their own race?  What is the\\nArab but the pirate of the desert--the sea of sand?  Black is the colour\\nfor pirates.  Even the white pirates feel the truth of this, or why do\\nthey hoist the _black_ flag?\"\\n\\n\"At all events, it\\'s a profession that seldom ends well.\"\\n\\n\"And what matter does that make?  We can die but once--I care not how\\nsoon.  I have not found life so very sweet as to care for it, I assure\\nyou.  Cato, there is but one thing sweet in existence--one feeling that\\nnever clogs and never tires, and that is revenge.\"\\n\\n\"Are not love and friendship sweet?  I certainly know nothing about the\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"I know no more than you do of it.  They say friendship is the more\\nlasting; and as a proof of how lasting that is I snapped my pistol at\\nyou, and, had it not missed fire, should have killed the only one for\\nwhom I ever felt friendship in this world.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bad habit you have of carrying your pistols at all times; they\\nare too handy, and give no time or reflection.  Only suppose, now, you\\nhad blown out my brains, you would have been very sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Cato, I have many lives on my hands, and hope to have many more before\\nI die.  I never have repented one act of my life--a murder, as you may\\ncall it--and I never shall.  But I tell you frankly, that had I\\ndestroyed you in my passion I should have been a miserable man.  I know\\nit; I feel it.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s say no more about it: that I\\'m just as glad as you are that you\\ndid not kill me, I assure you most positively.  Here\\'s Jose coming with\\nthe dinner.\"\\n\\nHere ended our conversation, which I have given just to show the\\npeculiar disposition of this extraordinary man, with whom I had become\\ndomesticated.  Verily and truly was I, as he said, \"like a little dog in\\nthe cage of a tiger,\" and, from familiarity: just as bold as dogs become\\nunder such peculiar circumstances.\\n\\nBefore morning we were again at anchor in the Rendezvous Bay, and the\\ntents were pitched as before.  We remained there for more than a\\nfortnight, during which my intimacy with the captain was even greater\\nthan before.  He appeared to endeavour to do all in his power to restore\\nmy confidence in him, and he succeeded.  Still, I must say, that I began\\nto be weary of this sort of life.  My dreams were ever of murder and\\nbloodshed; and more than once I felt inclined to make my escape: but I\\nhad promised, and the remembrance of my promise prevented me.\\n\\nOne afternoon the man on the look-out made the usual signal for a vessel\\nin sight.  Vincent went up immediately, and I followed him.  It was a\\nschooner, very long, with very taut, raking masts.  Vincent examined her\\nfor some time, and then gave me the glass, and asked me what I thought\\nof her.  I replied, that I thought she was a man-of-war schooner.\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said he, \"I know her well; it is the Arrow, and she has\\ncome out to cruise for me.  This is the third time that she has been\\nsent after me.  Once we exchanged a few broadsides, but another\\nman-of-war hove in sight, and I was compelled to leave her.  She shall\\nnot accuse me of running from her, now that she is alone, and by\\nto-morrow morning I will give her the opportunity of making the report\\nof my capture if she can; but if I capture her, you may guess the rest.\"\\n\\nWe remained till nearly sunset watching the motions of the schooner.\\nVincent then went down the hill to give orders for sailing, leaving me\\nwith the glass.  I again directed it to the schooner, and perceived that\\nshe was making signals.\\n\\nThen she is not alone, thought I; and Vincent may not capture her quite\\nso easily as he expects.  I looked in vain for the other vessel; I could\\nnot see her; I therefore concluded that she must be somewhere under the\\nland, and hidden by it from my sight.\\n\\nThe signals were repeated till dusk when I went down the hill, and found\\nthat all was bustle and activity, Vincent superintending himself the\\npreparations for sailing.  I did not interrupt him to tell him that I\\nhad perceived the schooner making signals.  I had an idea, somehow or\\nanother, that I should regain my liberty, and was as anxious as Vincent\\nthat the Stella should be under weigh.\\n\\nBefore ten o\\'clock everything was ready.  Vincent had told his men that\\nthe English man-of-war schooner was outside, and that he intended to\\nfight her; the men appeared delighted at the proposal, and as resolute\\nand determined as men should be.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella was clear of the bay, everything was got ready for\\naction, and I must say that nothing could be more rapid or more quiet\\nthan their movements.  We stood out until we had gained an offing of\\nfive miles, and then made a reach along the shore towards the Havannah.\\n\\nAs soon as the Stella had laid her head towards the Havannah, Vincent\\ncame down below.  I had latterly slept on one of the cabin sofas, but\\nhad this night remained with my clothes on, for I was not sure that we\\nmight not be in action before the morning.\\n\\nThe Arrow had gained the knowledge that our Rendezvous Bay was somewhere\\nabout the east end of the island, and had cruised accordingly, but could\\nnot discover it.\\n\\nVincent threw himself on the other sofa, and I pretended to asleep; as I\\ndid not wish to enter into conversation with him was too much occupied\\nwith my own thoughts, and felt that there would be nothing in common\\nbetween us at such a moment.  He was very soon asleep, and he talked in\\nhis sleep.  He was evidently in action, and gave his orders, every now\\nand then speaking a few words aloud, and then it appeared as if he had\\ntaken the English schooner, and that he was fulfilling his vows of\\nretaliation.  I shuddered as I heard the half-broken menaces--the\\nexulting laugh which occasionally burst from his lips.  I arose and\\nwatched him as he slept; his hands were continually in motion, and his\\nfists clenched, and he smiled.  Merciful Heaven! what a tale of savage\\ncruelty that smile foretold if he were successful!  I knelt down and\\nprayed that he might be foiled in his endeavours.  As I rose I heard a\\nnoise and talking on deck, and one of the mates came down in the cabin.\\n\\n\"How does she bear?\" cried Vincent, starting up from his couch, as if he\\ninstinctively knew what was to be told.\\n\\n\"Two points on the weather bow, captain,\" replied the negro.  \"I think\\nshe has her foresheet to windward.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the time?\"\\n\\n\"One bell in the morning watch; it will be daylight in an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Very good.  How far is she off?\"\\n\\n\"About four miles.\"\\n\\n\"Pipe to quarters; I will be up directly.\"\\n\\nVincent took down his sword and buckled on his belt; then his pistols,\\nwhich after having examined the primings, he fixed in his girdle.  I\\nstill remained as if asleep, and as he was going out of the cabin, he\\nturned to me.  \"He sleeps, poor boy; well, why should I wake him?--the\\nguns will rouse him up soon enough.\"  So saying, he went on deck.\\n\\nI considered what I should do.  To be on deck was hardly safe for me as\\na white person; and, indeed, what business had I there?  Why should I\\nexpose myself to the shot of my countrymen, or run the risk of losing my\\nlife from the rage of the negroes?  I therefore resolved on remaining\\nwhere I was--at all events, for the present.\\n\\nThe negroes now came into the cabin, for the after-magazine was under\\nthe forepart of it.  The hatch was taken up, the screens let down, and\\nall was dark.  I had nothing to do but to catch now and then the\\ncommands given by the negro captain, and draw my inference as to what\\nwas taking place.\\n\\nAlthough for the first half-hour I gained little information, after that\\ntime had elapsed I knew what was going on.  I heard a voice hailing us\\nfrom another vessel, and the reply of the Stella was a broadside.  There\\ncould be no mistake in that.  The Stella was then put about, and the\\nother broadside given without a return from her opponent.  At last it\\ncame, and as the shot whizzed over or tore up the planking of the\\ngunwales, I certainly did feel very strangely.  I had never been in\\naction before, and the sensation was, I confess, that of alarm; but it\\nwas so mingled with curiosity as to what was going on, that it was\\nimpossible to say what my feelings were.  I longed to be on deck, and\\ncertainly would have been, if I had thought that I was safe with the\\npirate crew: that alone prevented me; I remained, therefore, in a most\\nunpleasant state of ignorance and suspense.\\n\\nThe broadsides were now exchanged rapidly and the wounded, brought down\\nbetween decks every minute, told me that the action was severe.  The\\norders of the negro captain were occasionally heard--they were cool and\\ndetermined.  Every minute some fresh manoeuvre was executed, and the\\nguns still worked as if there was nothing else to attend to.  At last,\\nthe daylight came down the hatchway, and I left the cabin and walked\\nforward between decks; I found the deck strewed with wounded and dying\\nmen, calling for water.  I was glad to be able to do something which I\\ncould consistently do, and I brought water from the cask and gave it to\\nthem, one after another, as fast as I could; I think there were at least\\nthirty men lying about the lower deck, some in pools of their own blood,\\nand sinking fast, for there was no surgeon on board of the Stella.\\n\\nSome more wounded men were brought down, and a conversation took place\\nbetween one of the mates of the schooner, who was hurt, and the men who\\nbrought down the wounded, and listening to them, I found that at\\ndaylight they had discovered that an English frigate was under all sail,\\nbeating up to them, and about five miles to leeward; that in\\nconsequence, the Stella was now carrying on a running fight with the\\nschooner (who was to windward of her), and trying to escape.  This\\naccounted for the signals which I had perceived that the English\\nschooner was making the evening before.  My anxiety at this intelligence\\nwas naturally much increased.  The Stella was trying to escape, and her\\nsailing powers were so remarkable, that I was afraid she would succeed.\\n\\nThe action was still continued between the two schooners, but now the\\nshot no longer hit the Stella, nor were there any more wounded men\\nbrought down; it was evident that the two vessels were now firing at\\neach other\\'s masts and rigging, the one to prevent, and the other to\\neffect her escape, by dismantling her antagonist.  I felt as if I could\\nhave given my left hand to have gone on deck.  I waited half an hour\\nmore, and then, curiosity conquering my fear, I crept gradually up the\\nfore ladder.  The men were working the guns to windward, the lee-side of\\nthe deck was clear, and I stepped forward, and got into the head, where\\nI could see both to windward and to leeward.  To leeward I perceived the\\nfrigate about four miles distant with every stretch of canvass that she\\ncould set on a wind; I knew her directly to be the Calliope, my own\\nship, and my heart beat quick at the chance of being once more on board\\nof her.\\n\\nTo windward, as the smoke occasionally cleared away, I saw the Arrow\\nschooner close hauled on the same tack as the Stella, and distant about\\na mile, every ten seconds the smoke from her guns booming along the\\nwater\\'s surface, and the shot whizzing through our rigging; she had not\\nsuffered much from our fire: her sails were full of shot-holes, it is\\ntrue, but her spars were not injured.  I then turned my eyes upon the\\nmasts and rigging of the Stella: apparently, the damage done was about\\nequal to that received by the Arrow; our sails were torn, but our spars\\nwere unscathed.\\n\\nThe water was smooth, although the breeze was fresh, and both schooners\\nwere running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but the Stella\\nhad evidently the advantage of sailing, and fore-reached upon her\\nopponent.  I perceived that everything depended upon a lucky hit and\\nhaving satisfied myself with what I had seen, I hastened down below.\\n\\nFor more than half an hour the firing continued without advantage on\\neither side, when a yell was given by the negro crew, and I heard them\\ncry on the deck that the Arrow\\'s foretop-mast was shot away.  I heard\\nthe voice of Vincent cheering his men, and telling them to be steady in\\ntheir aim.  My heart sunk at the intelligence, and I sat down on a\\nchest.\\n\\nThe firing now slackened, for the Stella had shot ahead of the English\\nschooner, and the negroes on deck were laughing and in high good-humour.\\nFor a few minutes the firing ceased altogether, and I took it for\\ngranted that the Stella had left her pursuers far behind; when of a\\nsudden, a whole broadside of guns were poured into us, and there was a\\nterrible crashing and confusion on the deck.\\n\\nI ran up the ladder to see what had happened.  It appeared that as the\\nStella was crossing the bows of the Arrow, the latter had, as a last\\nchance thrown up in the wind, and discharged her whole broadside into\\nus: two shots had struck our mainmast, which had fallen by the board.  I\\nperceived at once that the Stella\\'s chance was over--nothing could save\\nher; she might resist the schooner but could not escape the frigate.\\n\\nI ran down below, and went into the cabin; I was afraid that the negroes\\nmight perceive the joy in my countenance.  I heard the angry voice of\\nthe negro captain--I heard him stamping with rage, and I thanked God\\nthat I was not by his side.  The wreck of the mast was soon cleared\\naway; I heard him address his negroes, point out to them that it was\\nbetter to die like men at the guns, than swing at the yard-arm like\\ndogs.  Some of them came down and took on deck a quarter-cask of\\nspirits, which was plentifully supplied to all.\\n\\nThe English schooner had borne down upon us, and the action now\\ncommenced at pistol-shot.  Never shall I forget what took place for\\nnearly three-quarters of an hour; the negroes, most of them intoxicated,\\nfought with rage and fury indescribable--their shouts--their screams--\\ntheir cursing and blasphemy, mingled with the loud report of the guns,\\nthe crashing of the spars and bulwarks, the occasional cry of the\\nwounded, and the powerful voice of Vincent.  It was terrific between\\ndecks; the smoke was so thick, that those who came down for the powder\\ncould not see, but felt their way to the screen.  Every two seconds, I\\nheard the men come aft, toss off the can of liquor, and throw it on the\\ndeck, hen they went to resume their labour at their guns.\\n\\nAt the end of the time I have mentioned, the shot flew from to leeward,\\nas well as from to windward: the frigate had got within range, and was\\npouring in her broadside; still the firing and the shouting on the deck\\nof the Stella continued, but the voices were fewer; and as the firing of\\nthe frigate became more severe, they became fainter and fainter; and at\\nlast but an occasional gun was fired from our decks.\\n\\nI became so uneasy, that I could remain where I was no longer; I went\\nforward on the lower deck again, and tumbling over the wounded and the\\ndead, I crept up the fore-ladder.  I looked over the coamings of the\\nhatchway; the decks were clear of smoke, for not a gun was being fired.\\nMerciful Heaven! what a scene of slaughter!  Many of the guns were\\ndismantled, and the decks were strewed with the splinters and plankings\\nof the gunwale, broken spars, and negroes lying dead, or drunk, in all\\ndirections--some cut and torn to pieces, others whole, but mixed up with\\nthe fragments of other bodies: such a scene of blood I have never since\\nwitnessed.  Out of the whole crew, I do not think there were twenty men\\nleft unhurt, and these were leaning or lying down, exhausted with\\nfatigue or overcome with liquor, on various parts of the deck.\\n\\nThe fighting was over; there was not one man at his gun--and of those\\nwho remained still alive, one or two fell, while I was looking up from\\nthe shot, which continued every minute to pierce the bulwarks.  Where\\nwas Vincent?  I dare not go aft to see.  I dare not venture to meet his\\neye.  I dived down below again, and I returned aft to the cabin; there\\nwas no more demand for powder; not a soul was to be seen abaft.\\nSuddenly the after-hatchway grating was thrown off; I heard some one\\ndescend; I knew it was the hurried tread of the negro captain.  It was\\nso dark, and the cabin so full of smoke, that, coming from the light, he\\ndid not perceive me, although I could distinguish him.  He was evidently\\nbadly wounded, and tottered in his walk: he came into the cabin, put his\\nhand to his girdle, and felt for his pistol, and then he commenced\\npulling down the screen, which was between him and the magazine.  His\\nintentions were evident; which were to blow up the vessel.\\n\\nI felt that I had not a moment to lose.  I dashed past him, ran up the\\nladder, sprung aft to the taffrail, and dashed over the stern into the\\nsea.  I was still beneath the surface, having not yet risen from my\\nplunge, when I heard and felt the explosion--felt it, indeed, so\\npowerfully, that it almost took away my senses; so great was the shock,\\neven when I was under the water, that I was almost insensible.  I have a\\nfaint recollection of being drawn down by the vortex of the sinking\\nvessel, and scrambling my way to the surface of the water, amidst\\nfragments of timbers and whirling bodies.  When I recovered myself, I\\nfound that I was clinging to a portion of the wreck, in a sort of patch,\\nas it were, upon the deep blue water, dark as ink, and strewed with\\nsplintered fragments.\\n\\nThere I remained some minutes, during which time I gained my\\nrecollection: I looked around and perceived the Arrow schooner, lying\\nabout one hundred yards off, totally dismantled, and my own frigate\\nabout a quarter of a mile to leeward, as bright and as fresh as if she\\nhad just been refitted.  I observed a signal, made by the Calliope to\\nthe schooner, which was answered.  I looked in vain towards the\\nschooner, expecting her to lower down a boat.  The fact was, that the\\nCalliope had made the signal for her to do so, and the schooner had\\nreplied that she had no boat that could swim.  I then perceived that the\\nfrigate had lowered down a boat which was pulling towards me, and I\\nconsidered myself as safe.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, during which I had quite recovered myself, the boat\\npulled into the mass of floating fragments, and then the sailors ceased\\nrowing to look about them.  They perceived and pulled towards me--\\nhoisted me in over the gunwale, and laid me at the bottom of the boat.\\nI scrambled on my feet, and would have gone _aft_, when the midshipman\\nof the boat said to the men, \"Pass that cursed young pirate forward--\\ndon\\'t let him come aft here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, Mr Lascelles,\" thinks I--\"so you don\\'t know me; you shall know\\nme by-and-by.\"  I quite forgot that I was stained black, till one of the\\nmen who seized me by the collar to pass me forward, said, \"Hand along\\nthe nigger.  He\\'s a young one for the gallows, any how.\"\\n\\nThey handed me forward, and I did not choose to say who I was.  My love\\nof fun returned the moment that I was again with my shipmates.  After\\nlooking well round and ascertaining that I was the only one left alive,\\nthey pulled back to the frigate; and the midshipman went up to report.\\nI was handed up the side and remained at the break of the gangway, while\\nthe captain and first lieutenant were talking with Mr Lascelles: during\\nwhich Mr Tommy Dott came up to me, and, putting his finger to his left\\near, gave a cluck with his tongue, as much as to say, \"You\\'ll be hanged,\\nmy good fellow.\"\\n\\nI could not help giving the first mason\\'s sign which I taught to Mr\\nGreen in return for Tommy\\'s communication; to wit, putting my thumb to\\nmy nose, and extending my finger out towards him; at which Tommy Dott\\nexpressed much indignation, and called me a precious impudent varmin.\\nThe men who were near us laughed, and said that I was game at all\\nevents.  No one knew me; for not only was my face well stained, but I\\nwas covered from head to foot with a solution of salt water and\\ngunpowder, which made me still more indistinguishable.\\n\\nI had remained at the gangway about two minutes, when the first\\nlieutenant said, \"Bring the prisoner here.\"\\n\\nI immediately went aft; and as soon as I was standing before Captain\\nDelmar and the first lieutenant--(and behind were all the officers,\\nanxious to hear what I had to disclose)--I put my hand to my head,\\nhaving no hat, as may be supposed, and said, \"_Come on board, sir_,\"\\nreporting myself, as is usually the custom of officers when they return\\nfrom leave or duty.\\n\\n\"Good Heavens! that voice!--why, who are you?\" cried Captain Delmar,\\nstarting back a pace.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, sir,\" replied I, again putting my hand to my head.\\n\\nBob Cross, who was, with many of the seamen, close to me, quite\\nforgetting etiquette, ran up and caught me round the waist, looking me\\nfull in the face: \"It is him, sir--it is him!  Huzzah! huzzah!\" and all\\nthe seamen joined in the huzzahs, which were, however, mingled with a\\ngreat deal of laughter.\\n\\n\"Merciful Heaven! and so you have been blown up in that vessel,\" said\\nthe first lieutenant, coming to me, with great kindness.  \"Are you much\\nburnt?  Why, he\\'s quite black--where\\'s the surgeon?\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t hurt at all, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Let him be taken down and examined,\" said the captain with some\\nemotion; \"if not hurt, let him come into the cabin to me.\"\\n\\nThe captain went down the ladder, and then I shook hands with Tommy Dott\\nand all the other officers and midshipmen; and I will say that my\\nre-appearance appeared to give unusual satisfaction.  I went down into\\nthe gun-room and was stripped.  They were much surprised to find that I\\nwas not hurt, and even more when they discovered that I was black all\\nover, and that washing would not restore my colour.\\n\\n\"Why, Keene,\" said the first lieutenant, \"how is it that you have\\nchanged your colour?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sir, I\\'ve been playing the nigger for these last three months.  It\\nis a long story, but I will go with you to the captain, and I will tell\\nit there.\"\\n\\nAs soon as I had put on my uniform, I went up with Mr Hippesley to the\\ncabin, and having, at the captain\\'s request, taken a chair, I entered\\ninto a full explanation, which lasted more than an hour.\\n\\nAs soon as I had finished, Mr Hippesley who had plenty to do on deck,\\nbut who could not leave until he had heard my story, quitted the cabin,\\nand I found myself alone with the captain.\\n\\n\"I must say that I gave you up for lost,\" said Captain Delmar; \"the\\nboat\\'s crew were picked up the next morning, and reported that you were\\ndrowned in the cabin of the vessel.  Scoundrels, to desert you in that\\nway.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think they were to blame, sir; the water being so high in the\\ncabin, and my not answering to their call.\"\\n\\n\"But did they call you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir; I heard them call when I was half asleep, and I did not\\nanswer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am glad to hear you say so; but so convinced have we been of\\nyour loss, that I have written to your mother on the subject.  Strange,\\nthis is the second time that she has been distressed in this way.  You\\nappear to have a charmed life, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I shall long live to do credit to your protection, sir,\" replied\\nI.\\n\\n\"I hope so too, Mr Keene,\" replied the captain, very kindly; \"I\\nsincerely hope so too.  In all this business you have conducted yourself\\nvery manfully.  It does you great credit, and your mother ought to be\\nproud of you.\"\\n\\n\"Thanky, sir,\" replied I, for I was overjoyed at such language from\\nCaptain Delmar, and I thought to myself, if he says my mother ought be\\nproud of me, he feels so himself.\\n\\n\"Of course, you cannot do duty under such a masquerade as you are at\\npresent,\" continued the captain, who referred to my stained skin.  \"I\\npresume it will wear off by-and-by.  You will dine with me to-day; now\\nyou may go to your messmates.\"\\n\\nI left the cabin, bowing very respectfully, and pleased with what had\\noccurred.  I hastened to join my messmates, not, however, until I had\\nshaken hands with Bob Cross, who appeared as delighted to see me as if\\nhe was my father.\\n\\nI leave the reader to imagine the sort of levee which I held both on the\\nquarter-deck and below.  Mr Hippesley could not get any of the officers\\nto mind their duty.  I certainly was for two or three days the greatest\\npersonage in the ship.  After that, I had time to tell the whole of my\\nhistory quietly to Bob Cross.\\n\\nBob Cross, when he had heard me without interruption, said, \"Well,\\nMaster Keene, there\\'s no telling what a man\\'s born to till after he\\'s\\ndead, and then it\\'s all known: but it does appear to me that you are\\nborn to something out of the common.  Here you are, not sixteen, not\\nonly playing a man\\'s part, but playing it manfully.  You have been put\\nin most difficult situations, and always have fallen upon your feet in\\nthe end.  You appear to have an old head upon very young shoulders; at\\none moment to be a scampish boy full of mischief, and at another a\\nresolute, cool, and clever man.  Sarcumstances, they say, make men, and\\nso it appears in you; but it does seem strange for one and the same lad\\nto be stealing the purser\\'s plums at one moment, and twisting a devil of\\na nigger pirate round his finger the very next; and then you have had\\nsuch escapes--twice reported dead at head-quarters, and twice come to\\nlife again.  Now Master Keene, I\\'ve very good news to tell you: you\\ndon\\'t know how high you stand with the captain and officers: there\\'s a\\nfeeling of envy against a lad who goes ahead (as well as a man) which\\nblinds people to his real merits; but when he is supposed to be dead and\\ngone, and no longer in the way of others, then every one tells the real\\ntruth; and I do assure you that not only the officers, but the captain\\nhimself, grieved most sorely at your loss.  I saw the captain\\'s eyes\\nwink more than once when speaking of you, and the first lieutenant was\\nalways telling the other mids that he had not one worth his salt, now\\nthat you were gone.  And now that you have come back and gained so much\\ncredit for what has passed, I do really think that the captain is proud\\nof you.  I overheard a little conversation between the captain and first\\nlieutenant the day you came on board, after you had been in the cabin\\ntelling your adventures, and all that I can say is, that the game is in\\nyour own hands, if you only play your cards well, and never let Captain\\nDelmar have the least idea that you know that you have such claims upon\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"That I certainly will not,\" replied I, \"as it might check his feeling\\ntowards me.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly: I\\'ve often thought about you, and now that I like you so much,\\nI watch the captain for your sake, and listen particularly to what he\\nsays after dinner especially, when I\\'ve the opportunity; for you see,\\nwhen gentlemen drink wine, they speak more freely as to what they really\\nthink, just as we foremast-men do when we get our grog on board.  The\\ngreatest misfortune which could happen to you in your position would be,\\nthe captain marrying and having children on the right side of the\\nblanket as they call it.  Now I\\'ve often heard the captain express a\\ndislike to matrimony, and laugh at people\\'s getting married, which has\\npleased me very much for your sake, Master Percival.  You see, a man\\ndon\\'t think much of marrying after forty, and the captain must be fifty,\\nif not more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes: but if his brother dies--and he is a very infirm man--the captain\\nwill then be Viscount de Versely, and inherit very large estates, and\\nthen he will marry to have an heir to the title and estates even if\\nthere is no love in the case.\"\\n\\n\"So he may,\" replied Cross--\"there\\'s no saying; but still, even if he\\ndoes, it ain\\'t certain that he has a family; chickens must not be\\ncounted before they are hatched.  All you have to pray for then is, that\\nthe brother may prove as tough as our old admirals, whose senses get\\ntired of staying any longer in their bodies, and leave them long before\\ntheir hulks are worn out.\"\\n\\n\"Why do admirals live so long?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it is for the same reason that salt meat keeps so much\\nlonger than fresh; they have been forty or fifty years with the salt\\nspray washing in their faces and wetting their jackets, and so in time,\\nd\\'ye see, they become as it were pickled with brine.  Talking about\\nthat, how long will it be before you get that tanning off you?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; but as the captain says I\\'m to do no duty while it lasts,\\nI hope it won\\'t wear off too soon.\"\\n\\n\"Spoken like a midshipman: now take my advice, although not ordered to\\nyour duty, come up on deck and take your spy-glass.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve lost it, unfortunately.  That was a good glass, for it saved my\\nlife.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it turned out as good for you as a Freemason\\'s sign, which is more\\nthan Mr Green can say.  I don\\'t think he\\'ll ever make a sailor--he\\'d\\nbetter bear up for clerk, and then he might do very well for a purser\\nby-and-by.  There\\'s eight bells, Master Keene, so I think we had better\\nsay good night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\\n\\nThe Arrow schooner had suffered very severely in the contest, having\\nlost her commanding officer and thirteen men killed and wounded: indeed,\\nhad not the Calliope been at hand, it was the general opinion that the\\nStella would have overpowered her, notwithstanding that the latter had\\nlost her mainmast, for the Arrow was completely dismantled, and would\\nnot have been able to have made sail.\\n\\nThe Calliope sent her carpenters and best seamen on board to repair her\\ndamages, and the next day we stood away for Port Royal, Jamaica, to\\nannounce the destruction of the pirate vessel.\\n\\nIn the morning Captain Delmar sent for me.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, as you cannot do duty for the present, and as I do not wish\\nyou to be idle, I think you had better pay a little attention to\\nnavigation.  You send in your day\\'s work, I perceive, but I suppose you\\nhave never regularly gone through a course of study.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replied I; \"I fudge my day\\'s work, and I should be very glad\\nto learn navigation properly.\"\\n\\n\"So I presume.  Well, then, I have spoken with Mr Smith, the master,\\nwho has promised me to give you the necessary instruction.  You will\\ncommence to-morrow; you can sit at the table in the fore-cabin, where\\nyou will have nothing to distract your attention.  You may go now.\"\\n\\nI bowed and left the cabin, and meeting Bob Cross on the main deck, I\\ntold him what the captain had said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it, Master Keene; it shows that the captain does now take a\\nstrong interest in you.  He has never taken any trouble of that kind\\nwith any midshipman before.  It will be of great service to you, so pay\\nattention; it will please the captain if the master gives a good report\\nof you.  Who knows but you may be sent away in a prize, and I sent with\\nyou to take care of you?  Wouldn\\'t that be a capital spree?\"\\n\\nThe next day I commenced accordingly, under the tuition of the master,\\nand as I had not Tommy Dott to play with, I gave satisfaction, and\\ncontinued to do so until our arrival at Port Royal, when the captain\\nwent up to the admiral\\'s, stating all the particulars of the action,\\nand, by way of sequel, my adventures on board of the pirate vessel.  The\\nadmiral was so much interested that he requested Captain Delmar to bring\\nme on shore to dine with me the next day.\\n\\nI was still very black; but that made me, I presume more interesting.  I\\ntold my story over again, and it afforded great amusement to the\\ncompany; particularly to the ladies; and I have reason to believe that\\nmany compliments were paid me behind my back, by the admiral and\\nofficers who dined there; at all events, Captain Delmar was much\\npleased.\\n\\nMy strange history soon got wind.  The governor heard of it, and asked\\nCaptain Delmar about it.  The consequence was, that I received another\\ninvitation from the governor, and Captain Delmar again informed me that\\nI might tell my own story, which I did, modestly as before.  I say\\nmodestly, for I never was a boaster at any time; and I really believe\\nthat I thought much less of the circumstances than those did to whom I\\nnarrated them.  I had at that time but one wish, which was to find\\nfavour in the sight of Captain Delmar.  I felt that all my prospects in\\nlife depended upon that; and aware of his disposition, and the deference\\nthat he expected, humility had become, as it were, habitual.\\n\\nDuring the time that we remained at Port Royal I continued my studies in\\nthe cabin and as the captain remained almost altogether on shore, I\\nfound the run of the cabin very pleasant; but as I had no inclination to\\nstudy the whole of the day, I was not sorry that Tommy Dott was very\\noften my companion in the cabin, an entrance to which, as he could not\\npass the sentry at the door, he obtained by climbing down the mizen\\nchains, and creeping into the port windows.  As soon as the captain\\'s\\nboat was seen coming off Tommy was out again by the port as quick as a\\nmonkey, and I was very studiously poring over right-angled triangles.  I\\nrose, of course, as the captain entered the cabin.  \"Sit down, Mr\\nKeene,\" he would say--\"sit down; the master has reported favourably of\\nyou, and I am glad to hear of it.\"\\n\\nOne morning, when, as usual, Tommy Dott had come through the port, we\\nwere so busily employed with a caricature which we were making of old\\nCulpepper, that the captain\\'s boat came alongside without our being\\naware of it, and the captain\\'s voice speaking to the first lieutenant as\\nhe was descending the after-ladder was the first intimation we received\\nof his being on board.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Tommy Dott to escape without being seen as he\\nclimbed out.  The table which was in the centre of the cabin was covered\\nwith a blue cloth, large enough for the table when all the additional\\nleaves were put to it, and in its present reduced size the cloth fell\\ndown to the deck; I pointed it out to Tommy, as the sentry\\'s hand upon\\nthe handle of the door announced the immediate entrance of the captain,\\nand he darted underneath the table, that he might escape detection\\nintending as soon as the captain went into the after-cabin to make his\\nretreat by the cabin-door or windows.  The captain entered, and I rose,\\nas usual, from my chair.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I have occasion to speak to the first lieutenant\\non important private business; oblige me by leaving the cabin till that\\nis done.  You may as well tell Mr Hippesley that I wish to see him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I making a bow, and leaving the cabin.  I felt very\\nmuch alarmed lest Tommy should be discovered in his hiding-place; and\\nafter the captain had stated that he had particular business with the\\nfirst lieutenant, it was my duty, knowing that Mr Dott was there, to\\nhave said so.  I hardly knew what to do, or how to act.  After all, it\\nwas no great crime as it stood.  Tommy Dott had come into the cabin\\nwithout leave, and had concealed himself; but if I was to allow Tommy to\\nremain there and listen to important and particular business, evidently\\nof a secret nature, I should forfeit the good opinion and confidence of\\nthe captain: nevertheless, I was very unwilling to betray him; I was\\ndreadfully puzzled, and when I went to the first lieutenant he perceived\\nmy confusion.\\n\\n\"Why, what is the matter with you, Mr Keene?--you look quite\\nfrightened,\" said he.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I am,\" replied I; \"and I think it my duty to tell you why I\\nam so.\"\\n\\nI then informed him that Tommy Dott was under the cabin-table, and\\nwould, of course, hear the secret communications of the captain.\\n\\n\"You have done very right, Mr Keene, and I know how unpleasant it is to\\nyou to inform against your messmate; but at present there is no harm\\ndone.\"\\n\\nHe then laughed, and said, \"However, Mr Dott shall never know that you\\nhave said anything about it, and I will frighten him out of the cabin\\nfor the future.\"\\n\\nHe then went down the ladder, and into the fore-cabin.  I expected that\\nhe would have discovered Tommy as if by accident, but such was not the\\ncase.  The captain had just gone into the after-cabin, and Mr Hippesley\\nimmediately followed him, and shutting the door, informed him of Mr\\nDott\\'s position, and why I had made it known.  The captain could not\\nhelp laughing, as, after all, it was no great offence.\\n\\nHe then gave the necessary information to the first lieutenant, and they\\nboth walked into the fore-cabin; the first lieutenant saying, \"If you\\nplease, then, Captain Delmar, I will send a boat immediately with the\\nletter.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" replied the captain, sitting down, and who evidently was\\ninclined to join in the joke with Mr Hippesley.  \"Sentry, send the\\nofficer on deck to man the jolly-boat, and tell Mr Dott to come here\\nimmediately.\"\\n\\nI was on deck when the sentry put his head up the ladder and gave the\\norder, and I immediately perceived the plan of the first lieutenant and\\nthe state of alarm in which Tommy Dott must have been put.\\n\\nThe jolly-boat was manned, and Mr Dott called for in every quarter of\\nthe ship, but he did not make his appearance.  After a delay of several\\nminutes, the officer on deck went down into the cabin, reporting that\\nthe jolly-boat had been manned some time but that Mr Dott was not to be\\nfound.\\n\\n\"Not to be found!\" replied the captain; \"why, he can\\'t have fallen\\noverboard.\"\\n\\n\"Not he, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant; \"he has gone to sleep\\nsomewhere: either in the tops or the fore-topmast staysail netting.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be a very troublesome boy,\" replied the captain.\\n\\n\"Very useless, indeed, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"Sentry,\\nhave they found Mr Dott?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir; quarter-masters have been everywhere.  He\\'s not in the ship.\"\\n\\n\"Very odd!\" observed the captain.\\n\\n\"Oh! he\\'ll turn up soon, sir; but really, Captain Delmar, if you were to\\ngive him two or three dozen at the cabin gun, it would bring him to his\\nsenses.\"\\n\\n\"That I most certainly will do,\" replied Captain Delmar; \"and I\\nauthorise you to do it, Mr Hippesley, as soon as he makes his\\nappearance; it will be of some service to him; but I hope no accident\\nhas happened to him.\"\\n\\n\"I have no fear of that, sir,\" replied the first lieutenant: \"if the\\npurser\\'s steward\\'s room had been open to-day, I should have sent to see\\nif he was not locked up in another attempt to steal raisins, but that\\nhas not been the case.  By-the-by, the spirit-room was open this\\nmorning, and he may have been down there, and may have had the hatches\\nput over him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we must send another midshipman; call Mr Keene,\" said Captain\\nDelmar.\\n\\nThe sentry called me, and I made my appearance.\\n\\n\"Mr Keene, you\\'ll go on shore to the dockyard in the jolly-boat: give\\nthat letter to the master attendant, and wait for an answer.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Have you seen anything of Mr Dott?\" said the first lieutenant; \"you\\nare constantly together.\"\\n\\n\"I saw him just before Captain Delmar came on board, sir, but I have not\\nseen him since.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, we will settle accounts with the young gentleman as soon as\\nhe turns up,\" replied the captain: \"you may go, Mr Keene.\"\\n\\nI perceived that the captain and first lieutenant both smiled as I left\\nthe cabin.  It appeared that soon after they left it and the captain\\nwent on shore; but Tommy was so frightened that he remained in his\\nhiding-place, as he made sure he would be flogged if he made his\\nappearance, and he resolved to remain where he was until my return, that\\nhe might consult me.\\n\\nAs soon as I had reported myself, and given the answer to the first\\nlieutenant, I hastened to the cabin, and then poor Tommy crawled from\\nunder the table; the tears were still wet on his cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall be flogged, Keene, as sure as I stand here.  Tell me, what can\\nI do--what can I say?\"\\n\\n\"Tell the truth; that\\'s the best way,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Tell the captain that I was hid under the table! that would never do.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, it\\'s the best plan,\" replied I; \"and it is the only\\nadvice I can give you: you may be flogged if you tell the truth, but you\\nare _sure_ to be flogged if you tell a lie.  It will only add to your\\noffence.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been thinking about it--I\\'m sure that Mr Hippesley will\\nflog me if he catches me to-day or to-morrow; but if I remain hid for a\\nday or two, they will really think that I have fallen overboard, and\\nthen they will say, `poor Tommy Dott,\\' and perhaps be so glad when I do\\nmake my appearance, that they will forgive me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied I, delighted at the idea; \"I\\'m sure they will, if you do\\ntell the truth when you appear again.\"\\n\\n\"Then, that is what I\\'ll do.  The first lieutenant said that I might be\\nin the spirit-room.  Where shall I go to?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said I, \"you must remain under the table till dark, and then you\\nmay easily slip down into the coal-hole, where it is so dark that they\\nnever will see you, even if they go down for coals.  It is the only\\nplace I know of; stay there all to-morrow and next day, and come up in\\nthe evening; or the next morning perhaps will be better.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a very good place,\" replied Tommy; \"anything better than\\nbeing flogged; but will you bring me something to eat and drink?\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon me, Tommy,\" replied I; \"I\\'ll contrive to bring you\\nsomething every night.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll do that,\" replied he.\\n\\n\"Yes; and tell the truth when you come out,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, upon my honour I will;\" and so saying, Tommy, hearing a noise,\\nagain dived under the cabin table.\\n\\nSoon afterwards I went out of the cabin.  The first lieutenant beckoned\\nme to him, and asked me where Mr Dott was, and I told him what had been\\narranged between us.  He laughed very much, and said--\\n\\n\"Well, if Master Tommy punishes himself by two days\\' confinement in the\\ncoal-hole, and tells the truth when he comes out, I think I may promise\\nhe will get off his flogging; but don\\'t you say that I have spoken to\\nyou about it, and let him do as he proposes.\"\\n\\nWhen it was dark, I supplied Tommy with provisions, and he gained the\\ncoal-hole without being discovered.\\n\\nThe next day the speculations at his disappearance were general, and it\\nwas now believed that poor Tommy had fallen overboard, and, as the\\nsharks are thick enough in Port Royal, that he was safely stowed away in\\none of their maws.  I will say that the whole of the ship\\'s company were\\nvery sorry for him, with the exception of Mr Culpepper, who observed\\nthat no good ever came of a boy who stole raisins.\\n\\n\"So you think, that because a lad steals a few of your confounded\\nplums,\" observed the second lieutenant, \"he deserves to be eaten by the\\nsharks.  If I were Tommy Dott, I would haunt you if I could.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of dead men,\" replied Mr Culpepper; \"they are quiet\\nenough.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps so; but recollect, you make them chew tobacco, and therefore\\nthey ought to rise up in judgment against you, if they do against any\\none.\"\\n\\nAs this conversation passed on the quarter-deck, it put an idea in my\\nhead.  That night I went to Tommy, whom I found terribly tired of\\nsitting on the coals.  I brought him a bottle of mixed grog, and some\\nboiled beef and biscuit.  I consoled him by telling him that every one\\nwas sorry at his disappearance, and that I was convinced that he would\\nnot be punished if he told the truth.\\n\\nTommy was for leaving the coal-hole immediately, but I pointed out to\\nhim that the captain had not been on board that a and that it was\\nnecessary that the captain should believe that he had fallen overboard\\nas well as the officers, or his compassion would not be roused.  Tommy\\nsaw the propriety of this, and consented to remain another day.  I then\\ntold him what Mr Culpepper had said, and I added, \"Now, Tommy, if Mr\\nCulpepper should see you by any chance, pretend to be your ghost.\"\\n\\n\"That I will,\" replied Tommy, \"if I get six dozen for it.\"  I then left\\nhim.\\n\\nOn my return on deck, I saw Bob Cross; he was on shore during the major\\nportion of the day, attending upon the captain, and as I was no longer\\nin the captain\\'s gig, I saw but little of him.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene,\" said he, \"I think you have quite recovered your\\ncolour by this time, and I hope to see you in the gig again.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think I shall yet awhile--I have not yet learnt navigation\\nenough; but the master says he will be done with me in a fortnight, if I\\ngo on as well as I do now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I heard him tell the captain that you were very quick, and would\\nbe a good navigator but I can\\'t get over the loss of poor Tommy Dott; he\\nwas a little scampish, that\\'s sartin, but still he was a merry,\\nkind-hearted boy--too good for the sharks, at all events.  You must feel\\nhis loss, Mr Keene, for you were always together.\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t, Bob,\" replied I.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m sorry to hear you say that, Mr Keene; I thought you had a\\nkinder heart.\"\\n\\n\"So I have, Bob; but I\\'ll tell you a secret, known only to the first\\nlieutenant and me; and that is, Tommy\\'s in the coal-hole, very dirty,\\nbut quite safe.\"\\n\\nBob Cross burst into a fit of laughing, which lasted some time.\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Keene, you have really taken a weight off my mind; now tell\\nme all about it.  You know I\\'m safe.\"\\n\\nI then told Bob what had happened, and of Tommy\\'s intention to make his\\nappearance on the following evening or the next morning.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Bob, \"you\\'re mischief itself, Master Keene, and that\\'s a\\nfact; however, it\\'s all right this time, and you have the captain and\\nfirst lieutenant as your confidants and partners in the joke.  You did\\nperfectly right and I\\'m sure the captain and first lieutenant must be\\npleased with you; but recollect, Master Keene, keep your distance as\\nbefore; don\\'t presume.\"\\n\\n\"Never fear, Bob,\" replied I: \"but now I have told you that, I want you\\nto assist me.\"  I then repeated the conversation of Mr Culpepper with\\nthe second lieutenant.\\n\\n\"Now,\" continued I; \"you see, Cross, I can\\'t do anything myself; Mr\\nCulpepper hates me, and would suspect me; but if we could only frighten\\nhim: you might, for he would not think you were playing him a trick.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" replied Bob; \"it will be a good thing for Tommy Dott, and a\\nnice wind-up of this affair.  Let me alone.  When I come on board\\nto-morrow evening I\\'ll manage it if I can.\"\\n\\nAfter a little more conversation, we separated for the night.\\n\\nThe next morning the captain came on board.  He remained on deck with\\nthe first lieutenant for some minutes, during which of course, he was\\nmade acquainted with Tommy Dott\\'s position.  When he came down into the\\ncabin, I moved from my seat, as respectful and serious as before; and\\nwhen ordered to sit down again, resumed my studies with great apparent\\ndiligence.  He did not say a word to me about Tommy Dott; and as he was\\ngoing out of the cabin, Mr Culpepper was announced by the sentry.\\n\\n\"If you please, Captain Delmar,\" said Mr Culpepper, with his usual\\nprofound bow, \"what are we to do with the effects of Mr Dott, who has\\nfallen overboard?  By the regulations of the service, they should be\\nsold before the mast.  And I also wish to know whether he is to be\\ncontinued to be victualled, or whether it is your pleasure that he is\\ndischarged as dead?\"\\n\\nThe captain smiled, and turned his face towards me; but I continued with\\nmy eyes down on my book.\\n\\n\"Perhaps we had better wait till to-morrow, Mr Culpepper,\" replied the\\ncaptain, \"and then you may sell his effects, and put DD to his name,\\npoor fellow.\"  And having made this reply, the captain went out of his\\ncabin.  Mr Culpepper followed; and shortly afterwards the captain went\\non shore again.\\n\\nBefore dusk, the captain\\'s gig, as usual, returned on board, and I was\\nat the gangway to meet Bob Cross; the boat was hoisted up, and then Bob\\ncame to me.\\n\\n\"I must first go down and see Mr Dott, that I may be able to swear to\\nthe fact.\"  Bob did so, and then returned on deck.  Mr Culpepper was\\nabaft, walking by himself, when Bob went up and accosted him.\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said Bob, touching his hat, \"did the captain say\\nanything to you about coals, for I expect we shall not stay here much\\nlonger?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Mr Culpepper.\\n\\n[end of the book]\\n\\nNow you have read it! Please summarize it for me!\\n\\nAssistant:'"
