       "'42, APRIL, 1861***\\n\\n\\nE-text prepared by Joshua Hutchinson, Tonya Allen, and Project Gutenberg\\nDistributed Proofreaders\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ATLANTIC MONTHLY.\\n\\nA MAGAZINE OF LITERATURE, ART, AND POLITICS.\\n\\nVOL. VII.--APRIL, 1861.--NO. XLII.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPRIL DAYS.\\n\\n\\n  \"Can trouble dwell with April days?\"\\n\\n_In Memoriam._\\n\\n\\nIn our methodical New England life, we still recognize some magic in\\nsummer. Most persons reluctantly resign themselves to being decently\\nhappy in June, at least. They accept June. They compliment its weather.\\nThey complained of the earlier months as cold, and so spent them in\\nthe city; and they will complain of the later months as hot, and so\\nrefrigerate themselves on some barren sea-coast. God offers us yearly a\\nnecklace of twelve pearls; most men choose the fairest, label it June,\\nand cast the rest away. It is time to chant a hymn of more liberal\\ngratitude.\\n\\nThere are no days in the whole round year more delicious than those\\nwhich often come to us in the latter half of April. On these days one\\ngoes forth in the morning, and an Italian warmth broods over all the\\nhills, taking visible shape in a glistening mist of silvered azure, with\\nwhich mingles the smoke from many bonfires. The sun trembles in his\\nown soft rays, till one understands the old English tradition, that he\\ndances on Easter-Day. Swimming in a sea of glory, the tops of the hills\\nlook nearer than their bases, and their glistening watercourses seem\\nclose to the eye, as is their liberated murmur to the ear. All across\\nthis broad interval the teams are ploughing. The grass in the meadow\\nseems all to have grown green since yesterday. The blackbirds jangle\\nin the oak, the robin is perched upon the elm, the song-sparrow on the\\nhazel, and the bluebird on the apple-tree. There rises a hawk and sails\\nslowly, the stateliest of airy things, a floating dream of long and\\nlanguid summer-hours. But as yet, though there is warmth enough for a\\nsense of luxury, there is coolness enough for exertion. No tropics can\\noffer such a burst of joy; indeed, no zone much warmer than our Northern\\nStates can offer a genuine spring. There can be none where there is no\\nwinter, and the monotone of the seasons is broken only by wearisome\\nrains. Vegetation and birds being distributed over the year, there is no\\nburst of verdure nor of song. But with us, as the buds are swelling, the\\nbirds are arriving; they are building their nests almost simultaneously;\\nand in all the Southern year there is no such rapture of beauty and of\\nmelody as here marks every morning from the last of April onward.\\n\\nBut days even earlier than these in April have a charm,--even days that\\nseem raw and rainy, when the sky is dull and a bequest of March-wind\\nlingers, chasing the squirrel from the tree and the children from the\\nmeadows. There is a fascination in walking through these bare early\\nwoods,--there is such a pause of preparation, winter\\'s work is so\\ncleanly and thoroughly done. Everything is taken down and put away;\\nthroughout the leafy arcades the branches show no remnant of last year,\\nsave a few twisted leaves of oak and beech, a few empty seed-vessels of\\nthe tardy witch-hazel, and a few gnawed nutshells dropped coquettishly\\nby the squirrels into the crevices of the bark. All else is bare, but\\nprophetic: buds everywhere, the whole splendor of the coming summer\\nconcentrated in those hard little knobs on every bough; and clinging\\nhere and there among them, a brown, papery chrysalis, from which shall\\nyet wave the superb wings of the Luna moth. An occasional shower patters\\non the dry leaves, but it does not silence the robin on the outskirts of\\nthe wood: indeed, he sings louder than ever, though the song-sparrow and\\nthe bluebird are silent.\\n\\nThen comes the sweetness of the nights in latter April. There is as yet\\nno evening-primrose to open suddenly, no cistus to drop its petals;\\nbut the May-flower knows the hour, and becomes more fragrant in the\\ndarkness, so that one can then often find it in the woods without\\naid from the eye. The pleasant night-sounds are begun; the hylas are\\nuttering their shrill _peep_ from the meadows, mingled soon with hoarser\\ntoads, who take to the water at this season to deposit their spawn. The\\ntree-toads soon join them; but one listens in vain for bullfrogs, or\\nkatydids, or grasshoppers, or whippoorwills, or crickets: we must wait\\nfor them until the delicious June.\\n\\nThe earliest familiar token of the coming season is the expansion of the\\nstiff catkins of the alder into soft, drooping tresses. These are so\\nsensitive, that, if you pluck them at almost any time during the winter,\\na day\\'s bright sunshine will make them open in a glass of water, and\\nthus they eagerly yield to every moment of April warmth. The blossom\\nof the birch is more delicate, that of the willow more showy, but the\\nalders come first. They cluster and dance everywhere upon the bare\\nboughs above the watercourses; the blackness of the buds is softened\\ninto rich brown and yellow; and as this graceful creature thus comes\\nwaving into the spring, it is pleasant to remember that the Norse Eddas\\nfabled the first woman to have been named Embla, because she was created\\nfrom an alder-bough.\\n\\nThe first wild-flower of the spring is like land after sea. The two\\nwhich, throughout the Northern Atlantic States, divide this interest are\\nthe _Epigaea repens_ (May-flower, ground-laurel, or trailing-arbutus)\\nand the _Hepatica triloba_ (liverleaf, liverwort, or blue anemone). Of\\nthese two, the latter is perhaps more immediately exciting on first\\ndiscovery; because it does not, like the epigaea, exhibit its buds all\\nwinter, but opens its blue eyes almost as soon as it emerges from the\\nground. Without the rich and delicious odor of its compeer, it has\\nan inexpressibly fresh and earthy scent, that seems to bring all the\\npromise of the blessed season with it; indeed, that clod of fresh turf\\nwith the inhalation of which Lord Bacon delighted to begin the day must\\nundoubtedly have been full of the roots of our little hepatica. Its\\nhealthy sweetness belongs to the opening year, like Chaucer\\'s poetry;\\nand one thinks that anything more potent and voluptuous would be less\\nenchanting,--until one turns to the May-flower. Then comes a richer\\nfascination for the senses. To pick the May-flower is like following in\\nthe footsteps of some spendthrift army which has scattered the contents\\nof its treasure-chest among beds of scented moss. The fingers sink in\\nthe soft, moist verdure, and make at each instant some superb discovery\\nunawares; again and again, straying carelessly, they clutch some new\\ntreasure; and, indeed, all is linked together in bright necklaces by\\nsecret threads beneath the surface, and where you grasp at one, you hold\\nmany. The hands go wandering over the moss as over the keys of a piano,\\nand bring forth fragrance for melody. The lovely creatures twine and\\nnestle and lay their glowing faces to the very earth beneath withered\\nleaves, and what seemed mere barrenness becomes fresh and fragrant\\nbeauty. So great is the charm of the pursuit, that the epigaea is really\\nthe one wild-flower for which our country-people have a hearty passion.\\nEvery village child knows its best haunts, and watches for it eagerly\\nin the spring; boys wreathe their hats with it, girls twine it in their\\nhair, and the cottage-windows are filled with its beauty.\\n\\nIn collecting these early flowers, one finds or fancies singular natural\\naffinities. I flatter myself with being able always to find hepatica, if\\nthere is any within reach, for I was brought up with it (\"Cockatoo\\nhe know me berry well\"); but other persons, who were brought up\\nwith May-flower, and remember searching for it with their almost\\nbaby-fingers, can find that better. The most remarkable instance\\nof these natural affinities was in the case of L.T. and his double\\nanemones. L. had always a gift for wild-flowers, and used often to bring\\nto Cambridge the largest white anemones that ever were seen, from a\\ncertain special hill in Watertown; they were not only magnificent in\\nsize and whiteness, but had that exquisite blue on the outside of\\nthe petals, as if the sky had bent down in ecstasy at last over its\\ndarlings, and left visible kisses there. But even this success was\\nnot enough, and one day he came with something yet choicer. It was a\\nrue-leaved anemone (_A. thalictraides_); and, if you will believe it,\\neach one of the three white flowers was _double,_ not merely with that\\nmultiplicity of petals in the disk which is common with this species,\\nbut technically and horticulturally double, like the double-flowering\\nalmond or cherry,--the most exquisitely delicate little petals, seeming\\nlike lace-work. He had three specimens,--gave one to the Autocrat of\\nBotany, who said it was almost or quite unexampled, and another to me.\\nAs the man in the fable says of the chameleon,--\"I have it yet, and can\\nproduce it.\"\\n\\nNow comes the marvel. The next winter L. went to New York for a year,\\nand wrote to me, as spring drew near, with solemn charge to visit his\\nfavorite haunt and find another specimen. Armed with this letter of\\nintroduction, I sought the spot, and tramped through and through its\\nleafy corridors. Beautiful wood-anemones I found, to be sure, trembling\\non their fragile stems, deserving all their pretty names,--Wind-flower,\\nEaster-flower, Pasque-flower, and homeopathic Pulsatilla; rue-leaved\\nanemones I found also, rising taller and straighter and firmer in stem,\\nwith the whorl of leaves a little higher up on the stalk than one\\nfancies it ought to be, as if there were a supposed danger that the\\nflowers would lose their balance, and as if the leaves must be all ready\\nto catch them. These I found, but the special wonder was not there for\\nme. Then I wrote to L. that he must evidently come himself and search;\\nor that, perhaps, as Sir Thomas Browne avers that \"smoke doth follow the\\nfairest,\" so his little treasures had followed him towards New York.\\nJudge of my surprise, when, on opening his next letter, out dropped,\\nfrom those folds of metropolitan paper, a veritable double anemone. He\\nhad just been out to Hoboken, or some such place, to spend an afternoon,\\nand, of course, his pets were there to meet him; and from that day to\\nthis, I have never heard of the thing happening to any one else.\\n\\nMay-Day is never allowed to pass in this community without profuse\\nlamentations over the tardiness of our spring as compared with that\\nof England and the poets. Yet it is very common to exaggerate this\\ndifference. Even so good an observer as Wilson Flagg is betrayed into\\nsaying that the epigaea and hepatica \"seldom make their appearance until\\nafter the middle of April\" in Massachusetts, and that \"it is not unusual\\nfor the whole month of April to pass away without producing more than\\ntwo or three species of wild-flowers.\" But I have formerly found the\\nhepatica in bloom at Mount Auburn, for three successive years, on the\\ntwenty-seventh of March; and last spring it was actually found, farther\\ninland, where the season is later, on the seventeenth. The May-flower is\\nusually as early, though the more gradual expansion of the buds renders\\nit less easy to give dates. And there are nearly twenty species which I\\nhave noted, for five or six years together, as found before May-Day, and\\nwhich may therefore be properly assigned to April. The list includes\\nbloodroot, cowslip, houstonia, saxifrage, dandelion, chickweed,\\ncinquefoil, strawberry, mouse-ear, bellwort, dog\\'s-tooth violet, five\\nspecies of violet proper, and two of anemone. These are all common\\nflowers, and easily observed; and the catalogue might be increased by\\nrare ones, as the white corydalis, the smaller yellow violet, (_V.\\nrotundifolia_,) and the claytonia or spring-beauty.\\n\\nBut in England the crocus and the snowdrop--neither being probably an\\nindigenous flower, since neither is mentioned by Chaucer--usually open\\nbefore the first of March; indeed, the snowdrop was formerly known by\\nthe yet more fanciful name of \"Fair Maid of February.\" Chaucer\\'s daisy\\ncomes equally early; and March brings daffodils, narcissi, violets,\\ndaisies, jonquils, hyacinths, and marsh-marigolds. This is altogether in\\nadvance of our season, so far as the flowers give evidence,--though we\\nhave plucked snowdrops in February. But, on the other hand, it would\\nappear, that, though a larger number of birds winter in England than in\\nMassachusetts, yet the return of those which migrate is actually earlier\\namong us. From journals kept during sixty years in England, and an\\nabstract of which is printed in Hone\\'s \"Every-Day Book,\" it appears that\\nonly two birds of passage revisit England before the fifteenth of April,\\nand only thirteen more before the first of May; while with us the\\nsong-sparrow and the bluebird appear about the first of March, and quite\\na number more by the middle of April. This is a peculiarity of the\\nEnglish spring which I have never seen explained or even mentioned.\\n\\nAfter the epigaea and the hepatica have opened, there is a slight pause\\namong the wild-flowers,--these two forming a distinct prologue for their\\nannual drama, as the brilliant witch-hazel in October brings up its\\nseparate epilogue. The truth is, Nature attitudinizes a little, liking\\nto make a neat finish with everything, and then to begin again with\\n_eclat_. Flowers seem spontaneous things enough, but there is evidently\\na secret marshalling among them, that all may be brought out with due\\neffect. As the country-people say that so long as any snow is left on\\nthe ground more snow may be expected, it must all vanish simultaneously\\nat last,--so every seeker of spring-flowers has observed how accurately\\nthey seem to move in platoons, with little straggling. Each species\\nseems to burst upon us with a united impulse; you may search for them\\nday after day in vain, but the day when you find one specimen the spell\\nis broken and you find twenty. By the end of April all the margins\\nof the great poem of the woods are illuminated with these exquisite\\nvignettes.\\n\\nMost of the early flowers either come before the full unfolding of their\\nleaves or else have inconspicuous ones. Yet Nature always provides for\\nher bouquets the due proportion of green. The verdant and graceful\\nsprays of the wild raspberry are unfolded very early, long before its\\ntime of flowering. Over the meadows spread the regular Chinese-pagodas\\nof the equisetum, (horsetail or scouring-rush,) and the rich coarse\\nvegetation of the veratrum, or American hellebore. In moist copses the\\nferns and osmundas begin to uncurl in April, opening their soft coils\\nof spongy verdure, coated with woolly down, from which the humming-bird\\nsteals the lining of her nest.\\n\\nThe early blossoms represent the aboriginal epoch of our history: the\\nblood-root and the May-flower are older than the white man, older\\nperchance than the red man; they alone are the true Native Americans. Of\\nthe later wild plants, many of the most common are foreign importations.\\nIn our sycophancy we attach grandeur to the name _exotic_: we call\\naristocratic garden-flowers by that epithet; yet they are no more exotic\\nthan the humbler companions they brought with them, which have become\\nnaturalized. The dandelion, the buttercup, duckweed, celandine, mullein,\\nburdock, yarrow, whiteweed, nightshade, and most of the thistles,--these\\nare importations. Miles Standish never crushed these with his heavy heel\\nas he strode forth to give battle to the savages; they never kissed the\\ndaintier foot of Priscilla, the Puritan maiden. It is noticeable that\\nthese are all of rather coarser texture than our indigenous flowers; the\\nchildren instinctively recognize this, and are apt to omit them, when\\ngathering the more delicate native blossoms of the woods.\\n\\nThere is something touching in the gradual retirement before\\ncivilization of these delicate aborigines. They do not wait for the\\nactual brute contact of red bricks and curbstones, but they feel the\\ndanger miles away. The Indians called the low plantain \"the white man\\'s\\nfootstep\"; and these shy creatures gradually disappear, the moment\\nthe red man gets beyond their hearing. Bigelow\\'s delightful \"Florula\\nBostoniensis\" is becoming a series of epitaphs. Too well we know it,--we\\nwho in happy Cambridge childhood often gathered, almost within a stone\\'s\\nthrow of Professor Agassiz\\'s new Museum, the arethusa and the gentian,\\nthe cardinal-flower and the gaudy rhexia,--we who remember the last\\nsecret hiding-place of the rhodora in West Cambridge, of the yellow\\nviolet and the _Viola debilis_ in Watertown, of the _Convallaria\\ntrifolia_ near Fresh Pond, of the _Hottonia_ beyond Wellington\\'s Hill,\\nof the _Cornus florida_ in West Roxbury, of the _Clintonia_ and the\\ndwarf ginseng in Brookline,--we who have found in its one chosen nook\\nthe sacred _Andromeda polyfolia_ of Linnaeus. Now vanished almost or\\nwholly from city-suburbs, these fragile creatures still linger in\\nmore rural parts of Massachusetts; but they are doomed everywhere,\\nunconsciously, yet irresistibly; while others still more shy, as the\\n_Linnoea_, the yellow _Cypripedium_, the early pink _Azalea_, and the\\ndelicate white _Corydalis_ or \"Dutchman\\'s breeches,\" are being chased\\ninto the very recesses of the Green and the White Mountains. The relics\\nof the Indian tribes are supported by the legislature at Martha\\'s\\nVineyard, while these precursors of the Indian are dying unfriended\\naway.\\n\\nAnd with these receding plants go also the special insects which haunt\\nthem. Who that knew that pure enthusiast, Dr. Harris, but remembers the\\naccustomed lamentations of the entomologist over the departure of these\\nwinged companions of his lifetime? Not the benevolent Mr. John Beeson\\nmore tenderly mourns the decay of the Indians than he the exodus of\\nthese more delicate native tribes. In a letter which I happened to\\nreceive from him a short time previous to his death, he thus renewed\\nthe lament:--\"I mourn for the loss of many of the beautiful plants\\nand insects that were once found in this vicinity. _Clethra, Rhodora,\\nSanguinaria, Viola debilis, Viola acuta, Dracoena borealis, Rhexia,\\nCypripedium, Corallorhiza verna, Orchis spectabilis_, with others of\\nless note, have been rooted out by the so-called hand of improvement.\\n_Cicindela rugifrons, Helluo proeusta, Sphoeroderus stenostomus,\\nBlethisa quadricollis, (Americana mi,) Carabus, Horia_, (which for\\nseveral years occurred in profusion on the sands beyond Mount Auburn,)\\nwith others, have entirely disappeared from their former haunts, driven\\naway, or exterminated perhaps, by the changes effected therein. There\\nmay still remain in your vicinity some sequestered spots, congenial\\nto these and other rarities, which may reward the botanist and the\\nentomologist who will search them carefully. Perhaps you may find there\\nthe pretty coccinella-shaped, silver-margined _Omophron_, or the still\\nrarer _Panagoeus fasciatus_, of which I once took two specimens on\\nWellington\\'s Hill, but have not seen it since.\" Is not this indeed\\nhandling one\\'s specimens \"gently as if you loved them,\" as Isaak Walton\\nbids the angler do with his worm?\\n\\nThere is this merit, at least, among the coarser crew of imported\\nflowers, that they bring their own proper names with them, and we know\\nprecisely whom we have to deal with. In speaking of our own native\\nflowers, we must either be careless and inaccurate, or else resort\\nsometimes to the Latin, in spite of the indignation of friends. There\\nis something yet to be said on this point. In England, where the old\\nhousehold and monkish names adhere, they are sufficient for popular\\nand poetic purposes, and the familiar use of scientific names seems an\\naffectation. But here, where many native flowers have no popular names\\nat all, and others are called confessedly by wrong ones,--where\\nit really costs less trouble to use Latin names than English, the\\naffectation seems the other way. Think of the long list of wild-flowers\\nwhere the Latin name is spontaneously used by all who speak of\\nthe flower: as, Arethusa, Aster, Cistus, (\"after the fall of the\\ncistus-flower,\") Clematis, Clethra, Geranium, Iris, Lobdia, Bhodora,\\nSpirtea, Tiarella, Trientalis, and so on. Even those formed from proper\\nnames (the worst possible system of nomenclature) become tolerable at\\nlast, and we forget the man in the more attractive flower. Are those\\nwho pick the Houstonia to be supposed thereby to indorse the Texan\\nPresident? Or are the deluded damsels who chew Cassia-buds to be\\nregarded as swallowing the late Secretary of State? The names have long\\nsince been made over to the flowers, and every questionable aroma has\\nvanished. When the godfather happens to be a botanist, there is a\\npeculiar fitness in the association; the Linaea, at least, would not\\nsmell so sweet by any other name.\\n\\nIn other cases the English name is a mere modification of the Latin\\none, and our ideal associations have really a scientific basis: as with\\nViolet, Lily, Laurel, Gentian, Vervain. Indeed, our enthusiasm for\\nvernacular names is like that for Indian names, one-sided: we enumerate\\nonly the graceful ones, and ignore the rest. It would be a pity to\\nLatinize Touch-me-not, or Yarrow, or Gold-Thread, or Self-Heal, or\\nColumbine, or Blue-Eyed-Grass,--though, to be sure, this last has an\\nannoying way of shutting up its azure orbs the moment you gather it, and\\nyou reach home with a bare, stiff blade, which deserves no better\\nname than _Sisyrinchium anceps._ But in what respect is Cucumber-Root\\npreferable to Medeola, or Solomon\\'s-Seal to Convallaria, or Rock-Tripe\\nto Umbilicaria, or Lousewort to Pedicularis? In other cases the merit\\nis divided: Anemone may dispute the prize of melody with Windflower,\\nCampanula with Harebell, Neottia with Ladies\\'-Tresses, Uvularia with\\nBellwort and Strawbell, Potentilla with Cinquefoil, and Sanguinaria with\\nBloodroot. Hepatica may be bad, but Liverleaf is worse. The pretty name\\nof May-flower is not so popular, after all, as that of Trailing-Arbutus,\\nwhere the graceful and appropriate adjective redeems the substantive,\\nwhich happens to be Latin and incorrect at the same time. It does seem a\\nwaste of time to say _Chrysanthemum leucanthemum_ instead of Whiteweed;\\nthough, if the long scientific name were an incantation to banish the\\nintruder, our farmers would gladly consent to adopt it.\\n\\nBut the great advantage of a reasonable use of the botanical name is,\\nthat it does not deceive us. Our primrose is not the English primrose,\\nany more than it was our robin who tucked up the babes in the wood;\\nour cowslip is not the English cowslip, it is the English\\nmarsh-marigold,--Tennyson\\'s \"wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in\\nswamps and hollows gray.\" The pretty name of Azalea means something\\ndefinite; but its rural name of Honeysuckle confounds under that name\\nflowers without even an external resemblance,--Azalea, Diervilla,\\nLonioera, Aquilegia,--just as every bird which sings loud in deep woods\\nis popularly denominated a thrush. The really rustic names of both\\nplants and animals are very few with us,--the different species are\\nmany; and as we come to know them better and love them more, we\\nabsolutely require some way to distinguish them from their half-sisters\\nand second-cousins. It is hopeless to try to create new popular\\nepithets, or even to revive those which are thoroughly obsolete. Miss\\nCooper may strive in vain, with benevolent intent, to christen her\\nfavorite spring-blossoms \"May-Wings\" and \"Gay-Wings,\" and \"Fringe-Cup\"\\nand \"Squirrel-Cup,\" and \"Cool-Wort\" and \"Bead-Ruby\"; there is no\\nconceivable reason why these should not be the familiar appellations,\\nexcept the irresistible fact that they are not. It is impossible to\\ncreate a popular name: one might as well attempt to invent a legend or\\ncompose a ballad. _Nascitur, non fit_.\\n\\nAs the spring comes on, and the densening outlines of the elm give daily\\na new design for a Grecian urn,--its hue, first brown with blossoms,\\nthen emerald with leaves,--we appreciate the vanishing beauty of the\\nbare boughs. In our favored temperate zone, the trees denude themselves\\neach year, like the goddesses before Paris, that we may see which\\nunadorned loveliness is the fairest. Only the unconquerable delicacy of\\nthe beech still keeps its soft vestments about it: far into spring, when\\nworn to thin rags and tatters, they cling there still; and when they\\nfall, the new appear as by magic. It must be owned, however, that the\\nbeech has good reasons for this prudishness, and possesses little beauty\\nof figure; while the elms, maples, chestnuts, walnuts, and even oaks,\\nhave not exhausted all their store of charms for us, until we have seen\\nthem disrobed. Only yonder magnificent pine-tree,--that pitch-pine,\\nnobler when seen in perfection than white-pine, or Norwegian, or Norfolk\\nIslander,--that pitch-pine, herself a grove, _una nemus_, holds her\\nunchanging beauty throughout the year, like her half-brother, the ocean,\\nwhose voice she shares; and only marks the flowing of her annual tide of\\nlife by the new verdure that yearly submerges all trace of last year\\'s\\nebb.\\n\\nHow many lessons of faith and beauty we should lose, if there were no\\nwinter in our year! Sometimes, in following up a watercourse among our\\nhills, in the early spring, one comes to a weird and desolate place,\\nwhere one huge wild grapevine has wreathed its ragged arms around a\\nwhole thicket and brought it to the ground,--swarming to the tops of\\nhemlocks, clenching a dozen young maples at once and tugging them\\ndownward, stretching its wizard black length across the underbrush, into\\nthe earth and out again, wrenching up great stones in its blind, aimless\\nstruggle. What a piece of chaos is this! Yet come here again, two months\\nhence, and you shall find all this desolation clothed with beauty\\nand with fragrance, one vast bower of soft green leaves and graceful\\ntendrils, while summer-birds chirp and flutter amid these sunny arches\\nall the livelong day. \"Out of the strong cometh forth sweetness.\"\\n\\nTo the end of April, and often later, one still finds remains of\\nsnowbanks in sheltered woods, especially those consisting of evergreen\\ntrees; and this snow, like that upon high mountains, has become hardened\\nby the repeated thawing and freezing of the surface, till it is more\\nimpenetrable than ice. But the snow that actually falls during April is\\nusually only what Vermonters call \"sugar-snow,\"--falling in the night\\nand just whitening the surface for an hour or two, and taking its name,\\nnot so much from its looks as from the fact that it denotes the\\nproper weather for \"sugaring,\" namely, cold nights and warm days. Our\\nsaccharine associations, however, remain so obstinately tropical, that\\nit seems almost impossible for the imagination to locate sugar in New\\nEngland trees; though it is known that not the maple only, but the birch\\nand the walnut even, afford it in appreciable quantities.\\n\\nAlong our maritime rivers the people associate April, not with\\n\"sugaring,\" but with \"shadding.\" The pretty _Amelanchier Canadensis_ of\\nGray--the _Aronia_ of Whittler\\'s song--is called Shad-bush or Shad-blow\\nin Essex County, from its connection with this season; and there is a\\nbird known as the Shad-spirit, which I take to be identical with the\\nflicker or golden-winged woodpecker, whose note is still held to\\nindicate the first day when the fish ascend the river. Upon such slender\\nwings flits our New England romance!\\n\\nIn April the creative process described by Thales is repeated, and the\\nworld is renewed by water. The submerged creatures first feel the touch\\nof spring, and many an equivocal career, beginning in the ponds and\\nbrooks, learns later to ignore this obscure beginning, and hops or\\nflutters in the dusty daylight. Early in March, before the first male\\ncanker-moth appears on the elm-tree, the whirlwig beetles have begun to\\nplay round the broken edges of the ice, and the caddis-worms to\\ncrawl beneath it; and soon come the water-skater _(Gerris)_ and the\\nwater-boatman _(Notonecta)_. Turtles and newts are in busy motion when\\nthe spring-birds are only just arriving. Those gelatinous masses in\\nyonder wayside-pond are the spawn of water-newts or tritons: in the\\nclear transparent jelly are imbedded, at regular intervals, little\\nblackish dots; these elongate rapidly, and show symptoms of head and\\ntail curled up in a spherical cell; the jelly is gradually absorbed for\\ntheir nourishment, until on some fine morning each elongated dot gives\\none vigorous wriggle, and claims thenceforward all the privileges\\nattendant on this dissolution of the union. The final privilege is often\\nthat of being suddenly snapped up by a turtle or a snake: for Nature\\nbrings forth her creatures liberally, especially the aquatic ones,\\nsacrifices nine-tenths of them as food for their larger cousins, and\\nreserves only a handful to propagate their race, on the same profuse\\nscale, next season.\\n\\nIt is surprising, in the midst of our Museums and Scientific Schools,\\nhow little we yet know of the common things before our eyes. Our\\n_savans_ still confess their inability to discriminate with certainty\\nthe egg or tadpole of a frog from that of a toad; and it is strange that\\nthese hopping creatures, which seem so unlike, should coincide so nearly\\nin their juvenile career, while the tritons and salamanders, which\\nborder so closely on each other in their maturer state as sometimes to\\nbe hardly distinguishable, yet choose different methods and different\\nelements for laying their eggs. The eggs of our salamanders or\\nland-lizards are deposited beneath the moss on some damp rock, without\\nany gelatinous envelope; they are but few in number, and the anxious\\nmamma may sometimes be found coiled in a circle around them, like the\\nsymbolic serpent of eternity.\\n\\nThe small number of birds yet present in early April gives a better\\nopportunity for careful study,--more especially if one goes armed with\\nthat best of fowling-pieces, a small spy-glass: the best,--since how\\nvalueless for purposes of observation is the bleeding, gasping, dying\\nbody, compared with the fresh and living creature, as it tilts,\\ntrembles, and warbles on the bough before you! Observe that robin in the\\noak-tree\\'s top: as he sits and sings, every one of the dozen different\\nnotes which he flings down to you is accompanied by a separate flirt and\\nflutter of his whole body, and, as Thoreau says of the squirrel, \"each\\nmovement seems to imply a spectator,\" and to imply, further, that the\\nspectator is looking through a spy-glass. Study that song-sparrow: why\\nis it that he always goes so ragged in spring, and the bluebird so\\nneat? is it that the song-sparrow is a wild artist, absorbed in the\\ncomposition of his lay, and oblivious of ordinary proprieties, while the\\nsmooth bluebird and his ash- mate cultivate their delicate warble\\nonly as a domestic accomplishment, and are always nicely dressed before\\nsitting down to the piano? Then how exciting is the gradual arrival of\\nthe birds in their summer-plumage! to watch it is as good as sitting at\\nthe window on Easter Sunday to observe the new bonnets. Yonder, in that\\nclump of alders by the brook, is the delicious jargoning of the first\\nflock of yellow-birds; there are the little gentlemen in black and\\nyellow, and the little ladies in olive-brown; \"sweet, sweet, sweet\" is\\nthe only word they say, and often they will so lower their ceaseless\\nwarble, that, though almost within reach, the little minstrels seem far\\naway. There is the very earliest cat-bird, mimicking the bobolink before\\nthe bobolink has come: what is the history of his song, then? is it a\\nreminiscence of last year? or has the little coquette been practising it\\nall winter, in some gay Southern society, where cat-birds and bobolinks\\ngrow intimate, just as Southern fashionables from different States\\nmay meet and sing duets at Saratoga? There sounds the sweet, low,\\nlong-continued trill of the little hair-bird, or chipping-sparrow, a\\nsuggestion of insect sounds in sultry summer, and produced, like them,\\nby a slight fluttering of the wings against the sides: by-and-by we\\nshall sometimes hear that same delicate rhythm burst the silence of the\\nJune midnights, and then, ceasing, make stillness more still. Now watch\\nthat woodpecker, roving in ceaseless search, travelling over fifty trees\\nin an hour, running from top to bottom of some small sycamore, pecking\\nat every crevice, pausing to dot a dozen inexplicable holes in a row\\nupon an apple-tree, but never once intermitting the low, querulous\\nmurmur of housekeeping anxiety: now she stops to hammer with all her\\nlittle life at some tough piece of bark, strikes harder and harder\\nblows, throws herself back at last, flapping her wings furiously as she\\nbrings down her whole strength again upon it; finally it yields, and\\ngrub after grub goes down her throat, till she whets her beak after the\\nmeal as a wild beast licks its claws, and off on her pressing business\\nonce more.\\n\\nIt is no wonder that there is so little substantial enjoyment of Nature\\nin the community, when we feed children on grammars and dictionaries\\nonly, and take no pains to train them to see that which is before\\ntheir eyes. The mass of the community have \"summered and wintered\" the\\nuniverse pretty regularly, one would think, for a good many years; and\\nyet nine persons out of ten in the town or city, and two out of three\\neven in the country, seriously suppose, for instance, that the buds upon\\ntrees are formed in the spring; they have had them before their eyes\\nall winter, and never seen them. As large a proportion suppose, in good\\nfaith, that a plant grows at the base of the stem, instead of at the\\ntop: that is, if they see a young sapling in which there is a crotch\\nat five feet from the ground, they expect to see it ten feet from the\\nground by-and-by,--confounding the growth of a tree with that of a man\\nor animal. But perhaps the best of us could hardly bear the severe test\\nunconsciously laid down by a small child of my acquaintance. The boy\\'s\\nfather, a college-bred man, had early chosen the better part, and\\nemployed his fine faculties in rearing laurels in his own beautiful\\nnursery-gardens, instead of in the more arid soil of court-rooms or\\nstate-houses. Of course the young human scion knew the flowers by name\\nbefore he knew his letters, and used their symbols more readily; and\\nafter he got the command of both, he was one day asked by his younger\\nbrother what the word _idiot_ meant,--for somebody in the parlor had\\nbeen saying that somebody else was an idiot. \"Don\\'t you know?\" quoth\\nBen, in his sweet voice: \"an idiot is a person who doesn\\'t know an\\narbor-vitae from a pine,--he doesn\\'t know anything.\" When Ben grows up\\nto maturity, bearing such terrible tests in his unshrinking hands, who\\nof us will be safe?\\n\\nThe softer aspects of Nature, especially, require time and culture\\nbefore man can enjoy them. To rude races her processes bring only\\nterror, which is very slowly outgrown. Humboldt has best exhibited the\\nscantiness of finer natural perceptions in Greek and Roman literature,\\nin spite of the grand oceanic anthology of Homer, and the delicate\\nwater-coloring of the Greek Anthology and of Horace. The Oriental and\\nthe Norse sacred books are full of fresh and beautiful allusions; but\\nthe Greek saw in Nature only a framework for Art, and the Roman only\\na camping-ground for men. Even Virgil describes the grotto of Aeneas\\nmerely as a \"black grove\" with \"horrid shade,\"--\"_Horrenti atrum\\nnemus imminet umbra_.\" Wordsworth points out, that, even in English\\nliterature, the \"Windsor Forest\" of Anne, Countess of Winchelsea, was\\nthe first poem which represented Nature as a thing to be consciously\\nenjoyed; and as she was almost the first English poetess, we might be\\ntempted to think that we owe this appreciation, like some other good\\nthings, to the participation of woman in literature. But, on the other\\nhand, it must be remembered that the voluminous Duchess of Newcastle, in\\nher \"Ode on Melancholy,\" describes among the symbols of hopeless gloom\\n\"the still moonshine night\" and \"a mill where rushing waters run\\nabout,\"--the sweetest natural images. So woman has not so much to claim,\\nafter all. In our own country, the early explorers seemed to find only\\nhorror in its woods and waterfalls. Josselyn, in 1672, could only\\ndescribe the summer splendor of the White Mountain region as \"dauntingly\\nterrible, being full of rocky hills, as thick as mole-hills in a meadow,\\nand full of infinite thick woods.\" Father Hennepin spoke of Niagara,\\nin the narrative still quoted in the guide-books, as a \"frightful\\ncataract\"; though perhaps his original French phrase was softer. And\\neven John Adams could find no better name than \"horrid chasm\" for the\\ngulf at Egg Rock, where he first saw the sea-anemone.\\n\\nBut we are lingering too long, perhaps, with this sweet April of smiles\\nand tears. It needs only to add that all her traditions are beautiful.\\nOvid says well, that she was not named from _aperire_, to open, as some\\nhave thought, but from _Aphrodite_, goddess of beauty. April holds\\nEaster-time, St. George\\'s Day, and the Eve of St. Mark\\'s. She has not,\\nlike her sister May in Germany, been transformed to a verb and made a\\nsynonyme for joy,--\"_Deine Seele maiet den trueben Herbst_\"--but April\\nwas believed in early ages to have been the birth-time of the world.\\nAccording to Venerable Bede, the point was first accurately determined\\nat a council held at Jerusalem about A.D. 200, when, after much profound\\ndiscussion, it was finally decided that the world\\'s birthday occurred on\\nSunday, April eighth,--that is, at the vernal equinox and the full moon.\\nBut April is certainly the birth-time of the year, at least, if not of\\nthe planet. Its festivals are older than Christianity, older than the\\nmemory of man. No sad associations cling to it, as to the month of June,\\nin which month, says William of Malmesbury, kings are wont to go to\\nwar,--\"_Quando solent reges ad arma procedere_,\"--but it holds the Holy\\nWeek, and it is the Holy Month. And in April Shakspeare was born, and in\\nApril he died.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PROFESSOR\\'S STORY.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\nTHE WHITE ASH.\\n\\n\\nWhen Helen returned to Elsie\\'s bedside, it was with a new and still\\ndeeper feeling of sympathy, such as the story told by Old Sophy might\\nwell awaken. She understood, as never before, the singular fascination\\nand as singular repulsion which she had long felt in Elsie\\'s presence.\\nIt had not been without a great effort that she had forced herself to\\nbecome the almost constant attendant of the sick girl; and now she was\\nlearning, but not for the first time, the blessed truth which so many\\ngood women have found out for themselves, that the hardest duty bravely\\nperformed soon becomes a habit, and tends in due time to transform\\nitself into a pleasure.\\n\\nThe old Doctor was beginning to look graver, in spite of himself. The\\nfever, if such it was, went gently forward, wasting the young girl\\'s\\npowers of resistance from day to day; yet she showed no disposition\\nto take nourishment, and seemed literally to be living on air. It was\\nremarkable that with all this her look was almost natural, and her\\nfeatures were hardly sharpened so as to suggest that her life was\\nburning away. He did not like this, nor various other unobtrusive signs\\nof danger which his practised eye detected. A very small matter might\\nturn the balance which held life and death poised against each other.\\nHe surrounded her with precautions, that Nature might have every\\nopportunity of cunningly shifting the weights from the scale of death\\nto the scale of life, as she will often do, if not rudely disturbed or\\ninterfered with.\\n\\nLittle tokens of good-will and kind remembrance were constantly coming\\nto her from the girls in the school and the good people in the village.\\nSome of the mansion-house people obtained rare flowers which they sent\\nher, and her table was covered with fruits--which tempted her in vain.\\nSeveral of the school-girls wished to make her a basket of their own\\nhandiwork, and, filling it with autumnal flowers, to send it as a joint\\noffering. Mr. Bernard found out their project accidentally, and, wishing\\nto have his share in it, brought home from one of his long walks some\\nboughs full of variously tinted leaves, such as were still clinging\\nto the stricken trees. With these he brought also some of the already\\nfallen leaflets of the white ash, remarkable for their rich olive-purple\\ncolor, forming a beautiful contrast with some of the lighter-hued\\nleaves. It so happened that this particular tree, the white ash, did not\\ngrow upon The Mountain, and the leaflets were more welcome for their\\ncomparative rarity. So the girls made their basket, and the floor of it\\nthey covered with the rich olive-purple leaflets. Such late flowers as\\nthey could lay their hands upon served to fill it, and with many kindly\\nmessages they sent it to Miss Elsie Venner at the Dudley mansion-house.\\n\\nElsie was sitting up in her bed when it came, languid, but tranquil, and\\nHelen was by her, as usual, holding her hand, which was strangely cold,\\nHelen thought, for one who--was said to have some kind of fever. The\\nschool-girls\\' basket was brought in with its messages of love and hopes\\nfor speedy recovery. Old Sophy was delighted to see that it pleased\\nElsie, and laid it on the bed before her. Elsie began looking at the\\nflowers and taking them from the basket, that she might see the leaves.\\nAll at once she appeared to be agitated; she looked at the basket,--then\\naround, as if there were some fearful presence about her which she was\\nsearching for with her eager glances. She took out the flowers, one\\nby one, her breathing growing hurried, her eyes staring, her hands\\ntrembling,--till, as she came near the bottom of the basket, she flung\\nout all the rest with a hasty movement, looked upon the olive-purple\\nleaflets as if paralyzed for a moment, shrunk up, as it were, into\\nherself in a curdling terror, dashed the basket from her, and fell back\\nsenseless, with a faint cry which chilled the blood of the startled\\nlisteners at her bedside.\\n\\n\"Take it away!--take it away!--quick!\" said Old Sophy, as she hastened\\nto her mistress\\'s pillow. \"It\\'s the leaves of the tree that was always\\ndeath to her,--take it away! She can\\'t live wi\\' it in the room!\"\\n\\nThe poor old woman began chafing Elsie\\'s hands, and Helen to try to\\nrouse her with hartshorn, while a third frightened attendant gathered up\\nthe flowers and the basket and carried them out of the apartment. She\\ncame to herself after a time, but exhausted and then wandering. In her\\ndelirium, she talked constantly as if she were in a cave, with such\\nexactness of circumstance that Helen could not doubt at all that she had\\nsome such retreat among the rocks of The Mountain, probably fitted up in\\nher own fantastic way, where she sometimes hid herself from all human\\neyes, and of the entrance to which she alone possessed the secret.\\n\\nAll this passed away, and left her, of course, weaker than before. But\\nthis was not the only influence the unexplained paroxysm had left behind\\nit. From this time forward there was a change in her whole expression\\nand her manner. The shadows ceased flitting over her features, and the\\nold woman, who watched her from day to day and from hour to hour as a\\nmother watches her child, saw the likeness she bore to her mother coming\\nforth more and more, as the cold glitter died out of the diamond eyes,\\nand the scowl disappeared from the dark brows and low forehead.\\n\\nWith all the kindness and indulgence her father had bestowed upon her,\\nElsie had never felt that he loved her. The reader knows well enough\\nwhat fatal recollections and associations had frozen up the springs of\\nnatural affection in his breast. There was nothing in the world he would\\nnot do for Elsie. He had sacrificed his whole life to her. His very\\nseeming carelessness about restraining her was all calculated; he knew\\nthat restraint would produce nothing but utter alienation. Just so\\nfar as she allowed him, he shared her studies, her few pleasures, her\\nthoughts; but she was essentially solitary and uncommunicative. No\\nperson, as was said long ago, could judge him,--because his task was not\\nmerely difficult, but simply impracticable to human powers. A nature\\nlike Elsie\\'s had necessarily to be studied by itself, and to be followed\\nin its laws where it could not be led.\\n\\nEvery day, at different hours, during the whole of his daughter\\'s\\nillness, Dudley Venner had sat by her, doing all he could to soothe and\\nplease her: always the same thin film of some emotional non-conductor\\nbetween them; always that kind of habitual regard and family-interest,\\nmingled with the deepest pity on one side and a sort of respect on the\\nother, which never warmed into outward evidences of affection.\\n\\nIt was after this occasion, when she had been so profoundly agitated\\nby a seemingly insignificant cause, that her father and Old Sophy were\\nsitting, one at one side of her bed and one at the other. She had fallen\\ninto a light slumber. As they were looking at her, the same thought came\\ninto both their minds at the same moment. Old Sophy spoke for both, as\\nshe said, in a low voice,--\\n\\n\"It\\'s her mother\\'s look,--it\\'s her mother\\'s own face right over\\nagain,--she never look\\' so before,--the Lord\\'s hand is on her! His will\\nbe done!\"\\n\\nWhen Elsie woke and lifted her languid eyes upon her father\\'s face, she\\nsaw in it a tenderness, a depth of affection, such as she remembered\\nat rare moments of her childhood, when she had won him to her by some\\nunusual gleam of sunshine in her fitful temper.\\n\\n\"Elsie, dear,\" he said, \"we were thinking how much your expression was\\nsometimes like that of your sweet mother. If you could but have seen\\nher, so as to remember her!\"\\n\\nThe tender look and tone, the yearning of the daughter\\'s heart for the\\nmother she had never seen, save only with the unfixed, undistinguishing\\neyes of earliest infancy, perhaps the under-thought that she might soon\\nrejoin her in another state of being,--all came upon her with a sudden\\noverflow of feeling which broke through all the barriers between her\\nheart and her eyes, and Elsie wept. It seemed to her father as if the\\nmalign influence,--evil spirit it might almost be called,--which had\\npervaded her being, had at last been driven forth or exorcised, and that\\nthese tears were at once the sign and the pledge of her redeemed nature.\\nBut now she was to be soothed, and not excited. After her tears she\\nslept again, and the look her face wore was peaceful as never before.\\n\\nOld Sophy met the Doctor at the door and told him all the circumstances\\nconnected with the extraordinary attack from which Elsie had suffered.\\nIt was the purple leaves, she said. She remembered that Dick once\\nbrought home a branch of a tree with some of the same leaves on it, and\\nElsie screamed and almost fainted then. She, Sophy, had asked her, after\\nshe had got quiet, what it was in the leaves that made her feel so bad.\\nElsie couldn\\'t tell her,--didn\\'t like to speak about it,--shuddered\\nwhenever Sophy mentioned it.\\n\\nThis did not sound so strangely to the old Doctor as it does to some\\nwho listen to this narrative. He had known some curious examples of\\nantipathies, and remembered reading of others still more singular.\\nHe had known those who could not bear the presence of a cat, and\\nrecollected the story, often told, of a person\\'s hiding one in a chest\\nwhen one of these sensitive individuals came into the room, so as not to\\ndisturb him; but he presently began to sweat and turn pale, and cried\\nout that there must be a cat hid somewhere. He knew people who were\\npoisoned by strawberries, by honey, by different meats,--many who could\\nnot endure cheese,--some who could not bear the smell of roses. If he\\nhad known all the stories in the old books, he would have found that\\nsome have swooned and become as dead men at the smell of a rose,--that\\na stout soldier has been known to turn and run at the sight or smell of\\nrue,--that cassia and even olive-oil have produced deadly faintings in\\ncertain individuals,--in short, that almost everything has seemed to be\\na poison to somebody.\\n\\n\"Bring me that basket, Sophy,\" said the old Doctor, \"if you can find\\nit.\"\\n\\nSophy brought it to him,--for he had not yet entered Elsie\\'s apartment.\\n\\n\"These purple leaves are from the white ash,\" he said. \"You don\\'t know\\nthe notion that people commonly have about that tree, Sophy?\"\\n\\n\"I know they say the Ugly Things never go where the white ash grows,\"\\nSophy answered. \"Oh, Doctor dear, what I\\'m thinkin\\' of a\\'n\\'t true, is\\nit?\"\\n\\nThe Doctor smiled sadly, but did not answer. He went directly to Elsie\\'s\\nroom. Nobody would have known by his manner that he saw any special\\nchange in his patient. He spoke with her as usual, made some slight\\nalteration in his prescriptions, and left the room with a kind, cheerful\\nlook. He met her father on the stairs.\\n\\n\"Is it as I thought?\" said Dudley Venner.\\n\\n\"There is everything to fear,\" the Doctor said, \"and not much, I am\\nafraid, to hope. Does not her face recall to you one that you remember,\\nas never before?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" her father answered,--\"oh, yes! What is the meaning of this\\nchange which has come over her features, and her voice, her temper, her\\nwhole being? Tell me, oh, tell me, what is it? Can it be that the curse\\nis passing away, and my daughter is to be restored to me,--such as her\\nmother would have had her,--such as her mother was?\"\\n\\n\"Walk out with me into the garden,\" the Doctor said, \"and I will tell\\nyou all I know and all I think about this great mystery of Elsie\\'s\\nlife.\"\\n\\nThey walked out together, and the Doctor began:--\\n\\n\"She has lived a twofold being, as it were,--the consequence of the\\nblight which fell upon her in the dim period before consciousness. You\\ncan see what she might have been but for this. You know that for these\\neighteen years her whole existence has taken its character from that\\ninfluence which we need not name. But you will remember that few of the\\nlower forms of life last as human beings do; and thus it might have been\\nhoped and trusted with some show of reason, as I have always suspected\\nyou hoped and trusted, perhaps more confidently than myself, that the\\nlower nature which had become ingrafted on the higher would die out and\\nleave the real woman\\'s life she inherited to outlive this accidental\\nprinciple which had so poisoned her childhood and youth. I believe it\\nis so dying out; but I am afraid,--yes, I must say it, I fear it has\\ninvolved the centres of life in its own decay. There is hardly any pulse\\nat Elsie\\'s wrist; no stimulants seem to rouse her; and it looks as if\\nlife were slowly retreating inwards, so that by-and-by she will sleep as\\nthose who lie down in the cold and never wake.\"\\n\\nStrange as it may seem, her father heard all this not without deep\\nsorrow, and such marks of it as his thoughtful and tranquil nature, long\\nschooled by suffering, claimed or permitted, but with a resignation\\nitself the measure of his past trials. Dear as his daughter might become\\nto him, all he dared to ask of Heaven was that she might be restored to\\nthat truer self which lay beneath her false and adventitious being. If\\nhe could once see that the icy lustre in her eyes had become a soft,\\ncalm light,--that her soul was at peace with all about her and with Him\\nabove,--this crumb from the children\\'s table was enough for him, as it\\nwas for the Syro-Phoenician woman who asked that the dark spirit might\\ngo out from her daughter.\\n\\nThere was little change the next day, until all at once she said in a\\nclear voice that she should like to see her master at the school,\\nMr. Langdon. He came accordingly, and took the place of Helen at her\\nbedside. It seemed as if Elsie had forgotten the last scene with him.\\nMight it be that pride had come in, and she had sent for him only to\\nshow how superior she had grown to the weakness which had betrayed her\\ninto that extraordinary request, so contrary to the instincts and usages\\nof her sex? Or was it that the singular change which had come over her\\nhad involved her passionate fancy for him and swept it away with her\\nother habits of thought and feeling? Or perhaps, rather, that she felt\\nthat all earthly interests were becoming of little account to her, and\\nwished to place herself right with one to whom she had displayed a\\nwayward movement of her unbalanced imagination? She welcomed Mr.\\nBernard as quietly as she had received Helen Darley. He  at the\\nrecollection of that last scene, when he came into her presence; but\\nshe smiled with perfect tranquillity. She did not speak to him of any\\napprehension; but he saw that she looked upon herself as doomed. So\\nfriendly, yet so calm did she seem through all their interview, that Mr.\\nBernard could only look back upon her manifestation of feeling towards\\nhim on their walk from the school as a vagary of a mind laboring\\nunder some unnatural excitement, and wholly at variance with the true\\ncharacter of Elsie Venner, as he saw her before him in her subdued,\\nyet singular beauty. He looked with almost scientific closeness of\\nobservation into the diamond eyes; but that peculiar light which he knew\\nso well was not there. She was the same in one sense as on that first\\nday when he had seen her coiling and uncoiling her golden chain, yet how\\ndifferent in every aspect which revealed her state of mind and emotion!\\nSomething of tenderness there was, perhaps, in her tone towards him;\\nshe would not have sent for him, had she not felt more than an ordinary\\ninterest in him. But through the whole of his visit she never lost her\\ngracious self-possession. The Dudley race might well be proud of the\\nlast of its daughters, as she lay dying, but unconquered by the feeling\\nof the present or the fear of the future.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Bernard, he found it very hard to look upon her and listen to\\nher unmoved. There was nothing that reminded him of the stormy-browed,\\nalmost savage girl he remembered in her fierce loveliness,--nothing of\\nall her singularities of air and of costume. Nothing? Yes, one thing.\\nWeak and suffering as she was, she had never parted with one particular\\nornament, such as a sick person would naturally, as it might be\\nsupposed, get rid of at once. The golden cord which she wore round her\\nneck at the great party was still there. A bracelet was lying by her\\npillow; she had unclasped it from her wrist.\\n\\nBefore Mr. Bernard left her, she said,--\"I shall never see you again.\\nSome time or other, perhaps, you will mention my name to one whom you\\nlove. Give her this from your scholar and friend Elsie.\"\\n\\nHe took the bracelet, raised her hand to his lips, then turned his face\\naway; in that moment he was the weaker of the two.\\n\\n\"Good-bye,\" she said; \"thank you for coming.\"\\n\\nHis voice died away in his throat, as he tried to answer her. She\\nfollowed him with her eyes as he passed from her sight through the door,\\nand when it closed after him sobbed tremulously once or twice,--but\\nstilled herself, and met Helen, as she entered, with a composed\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\"I have had a very pleasant visit from Mr. Langdon,\" Elsie said. \"Sit\\nby me, Helen, awhile without speaking; I should like to sleep, if I\\ncan,--and to dream.\"\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\nTHE GOLDEN CORD IS LOOSED.\\n\\n\\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather, hearing that his parishioner\\'s\\ndaughter, Elsie, was very ill, could do nothing less than come to the\\nmansion-house and tender such consolations as he was master of. It was\\nrather remarkable that the old Doctor did not exactly approve of his\\nvisit. He thought that company of every sort might be injurious in her\\nweak state. He was of opinion that Mr. Fairweather, though greatly\\ninterested in religious matters, was not the most sympathetic person\\nthat could be found; in fact, the old Doctor thought he was too much\\ntaken up with his own interests for eternity to give himself quite so\\nheartily to the need of other people as some persons got up on a rather\\nmore generous scale (our good neighbor Dr. Honeywood, for instance)\\ncould do. However, all these things had better be arranged to suit her\\nwants; if she would like to talk with a clergyman, she had a great\\ndeal better see one as often as she liked, and run the risk of the\\nexcitement, than have a hidden wish for such a visit and perhaps find\\nherself too weak to see him by-and-by.\\n\\nThe old Doctor knew by sad experience that dreadful mistake against\\nwhich all medical practitioners should be warned. His experience may\\nwell be a guide for others. Do not overlook the desire for spiritual\\nadvice and consolation which patients sometimes feel, and, with the\\nfrightful _mauvaise honte_ peculiar to Protestantism, alone among all\\nhuman beliefs, are ashamed to tell. As a part of medical treatment, it\\nis the physician\\'s business to detect the hidden longing for the food of\\nthe soul, as much as for any form of bodily nourishment. Especially in\\nthe higher walks of society, where this unutterably miserable false\\nshame of Protestantism acts in proportion to the general acuteness of\\nthe cultivated sensibilities, let no unwillingness to suggest the sick\\nperson\\'s real need suffer him to languish between his want and his\\nmorbid sensitiveness. What an infinite advantage the Mussulmans and the\\nCatholics have over many of our more exclusively spiritual sects in the\\nway they keep their religion always by them and never blush for it! And\\nbesides this spiritual longing, we should never forget that\\n\\n  \"On some fond breast the parting soul relies,\"\\n\\nand the minister of religion, in addition to the sympathetic nature\\nwhich we have a right to demand in him, has trained himself to the art\\nof entering into the feelings of others.\\n\\nThe reader must pardon this digression, which introduces the visit of\\nthe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather to Elsie Venner. It was mentioned\\nto her that he would like to call and see how she was, and she\\nconsented,--not with much apparent interest, for she had reasons of her\\nown for not feeling any very deep conviction of his sympathy for persons\\nin sorrow. But he came, and worked the conversation round to religion,\\nand confused her with his hybrid notions, half made up of what he had\\nbeen believing and teaching all his life, and half of the new doctrines\\nwhich he had veneered upon the surface of his old belief. He got so\\nfar as to make a prayer with her,--a cool, well-guarded prayer, which\\ncompromised his faith as little as possible, and which, if devotion were\\na game played against Providence, might have been considered a cautious\\nand sagacious move.\\n\\nWhen he had gone, Elsie called Old Sophy to her.\\n\\n\"Sophy,\" she said, \"don\\'t let them send that cold-hearted man to me any\\nmore. If your old minister comes to see you, I should like to hear him\\ntalk. He looks as if he cared for everybody, and would care for me. And,\\nSophy, if I should die one of these days, I should like to have that old\\nminister come and say whatever is to be said over me. It would comfort\\nDudley more, I know, than to have that hard man here, when you\\'re in\\ntrouble: for some of you will be sorry when I\\'m gone,--won\\'t you,\\nSophy?\"\\n\\nThe poor old black woman could not stand this question. The cold\\nminister had frozen Elsie until she felt as if nobody cared for her or\\nwould regret her,--and her question had betrayed this momentary feeling.\\n\\n\"Don\\' talk so! don\\' talk so, darlin\\'!\" she cried, passionately. \"When\\nyou go, Ol\\' Sophy\\'ll go; \\'n\\' where you go, Ol\\' Sophy\\'ll go: \\'n\\' we\\'ll\\nboth go t\\' th\\' place where th\\' Lord takes care of all his children,\\nwhether their faces are white or black. Oh, darlin\\', darlin\\'! if th\\'\\nLord should let me die fus\\', you shall fin\\' all ready for you when you\\ncome after me. On\\'y don\\' go \\'n\\' leave poor Ol\\' Sophy all \\'lone in th\\'\\nworld!\"\\n\\nHelen came in at this moment and quieted the old woman with a look. Such\\nscenes were just what were most dangerous, in the state in which Elsie\\nwas lying: but that is one of the ways in which an affectionate friend\\nsometimes unconsciously wears out the life which a hired nurse, thinking\\nof nothing but her regular duties and her wages, would have spared from\\nall emotional fatigue.\\n\\nThe change which had come over Elsie\\'s disposition was itself the cause\\nof new excitements. How was it possible that her father could keep away\\nfrom her, now that she was coming back to the nature and the very look\\nof her mother, the bride of his youth? How was it possible to refuse\\nher, when she said to Old Sophy that she should like to have her\\nminister come in and sit by her, even though his presence might perhaps\\nprove a new source of excitement?\\n\\nBut the Reverend Doctor did come and sit by her, and spoke such soothing\\nwords to her, words of such peace and consolation, that from that hour\\nshe was tranquil as never before. All true hearts are alike in the\\nhour of need; the Catholic has a reserved fund of faith for his\\nfellow-creature\\'s trying moment, and the Calvinist reread those springs\\nof human brotherhood and chanty in his soul which are only covered over\\nby the iron tables inscribed with the harder dogmas of his creed. It was\\nenough that the Reverend Doctor knew all Elsie\\'s history. He could not\\njudge her by any formula, like those which have been moulded by past\\nages out of their ignorance. He did not talk with her as if she were an\\noutside sinner, worse than himself. He found a bruised and languishing\\nsoul, and bound up its wounds. A blessed office,--one which is confined\\nto no sect or creed, but which good men in all times, under various\\nnames and with varying ministries, to suit the need of each age, of each\\nrace, of each individual soul, have come forward to discharge for their\\nsuffering fellow-creatures.\\n\\nAfter this there was little change in Elsie, except that her heart beat\\nmore feebly every day,--so that the old Doctor himself, with all his\\nexperience, could see nothing to account for the gradual failing of the\\npowers of life, and yet could find no remedy which seemed to arrest its\\nprogress in the smallest degree.\\n\\n\"Be very careful,\" he said, \"that she is not allowed to make any\\nmuscular exertion. Any such effort, when a person is so enfeebled, may\\nstop the heart in a moment; and if it stops, it will never move again.\"\\n\\nHelen enforced this rule with the greatest care. Elsie was hardly\\nallowed to move her hand or to speak above a whisper. It seemed to be\\nmainly the question now, whether this trembling flame of life would be\\nblown out by some light breath of air, or whether it could be so nursed\\nand sheltered by the hollow of these watchful hands that it would have a\\nchance to kindle to its natural brightness.\\n\\n--Her father came in to sit with her in the evening. He had never talked\\nso freely with her as during the hour he had passed at her bedside,\\ntelling her little circumstances of her mother\\'s life, living over with\\nher all that was pleasant in the past, and trying to encourage her with\\nsome cheerful gleams of hope for the future. A faint smile played over\\nher face, but she did not answer his encouraging suggestions. The hour\\ncame for him to leave her with those who watched by her.\\n\\n\"Good-night, my dear child,\" he said, and, stooping down, kissed her\\ncheek.\\n\\nElsie rose by a sudden effort, threw her arms round his neck, kissed\\nhim, and said, \"Good-night, my dear father!\"\\n\\nThe suddenness of her movement had taken him by surprise, or he would\\nhave checked so dangerous an effort. It was too late now. Her arms\\nslid away from him like lifeless weights,--her head fell back upon her\\npillow,--a long sigh breathed through her lips.\\n\\n\"She is faint,\" said Helen, doubtfully; \"bring me the hartshorn, Sophy.\"\\n\\nThe old woman had started from her place, and was now leaning over her,\\nlooking in her face, and listening for the sound of her breathing.\\n\\n\"She\\'s dead! Elsie\\'s dead! My darlin\\' \\'s dead!\" she cried aloud, filling\\nthe room with her utterance of anguish.\\n\\nDudley Venner drew her away and silenced her with a voice of authority,\\nwhile Helen and an assistant plied their restoratives. It was all in\\nvain.\\n\\nThe solemn tidings passed from the chamber of death through the family.\\nThe daughter, the hope of that old and honored house, was dead in the\\nfreshness of her youth, and the home of its solitary representative was\\nhereafter doubly desolate.\\n\\nA messenger rode hastily out of the avenue. A little after this the\\npeople of the village and the outlying farm-houses were startled by the\\nsound of a bell.\\n\\nOne,--two,--three,--four,--\\n\\nThey stopped in every house, as far as the wavering vibrations reached,\\nand listened--\\n\\n--five,--six,--seven,--\\n\\nIt was not the little child which had been lying so long at the point of\\ndeath; that could not be more than three or four years old--\\n\\n--eight,--nine,--ten,--and so on to\\nfifteen,--sixteen,--seventeen,--eighteen----\\n\\nThe pulsations seemed to keep on,--but it was the brain, and not the\\nbell, that was throbbing now.\\n\\n\"Elsie\\'s dead!\" was the exclamation at a hundred firesides.\\n\\n\"Eighteen year old,\" said old Widow Peake, rising from her chair.\\n\"Eighteen year ago I laid two gold eagles on her mother\\'s eyes,--he\\nwouldn\\'t have anything but gold touch her eyelids,--and now Elsie\\'s to\\nbe straightened,--the Lord have mercy on her poor sinful soul!\"\\n\\nDudley Venner prayed that night that he might be forgiven, if he had\\nfailed in any act of duty or kindness to this unfortunate child of his,\\nnow freed from all the woes born with her and so long poisoning her\\nsoul. He thanked God for the brief interval of peace which had been\\ngranted her, for the sweet communion they had enjoyed in these last\\ndays, and for the hope of meeting her with that other lost friend in a\\nbetter world.\\n\\nHelen mingled a few broken thanks and petitions with her tears: thanks\\nthat she had been permitted to share the last days and hours of this\\npoor sister in sorrow; petitions that the grief of bereavement might be\\nlightened to the lonely parent and the faithful old servant.\\n\\nOld Sophy said almost nothing, but sat day and night by her dead\\ndarling. But sometimes her anguish would find an outlet in strange\\nsounds, something between a cry and a musical note,--such as none had\\never heard her utter before. These were old remembrances surging up from\\nher childish days,--coming through her mother from the cannibal chief,\\nher grandfather,--death-wails, such as they sing in the mountains of\\nWestern Africa, when they see the fires on distant hill-sides and know\\nthat their own wives and children are undergoing the fate of captives.\\n\\nThe time came when Elsie was to be laid by her mother in the small\\nsquare marked by the white stone.\\n\\nIt was not unwillingly that the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather had\\nrelinquished the duty of conducting the service to the Reverend Doctor\\nHoneywood, in accordance with Elsie\\'s request. He could not, by any\\nreasoning, reconcile his present way of thinking with a hope for the\\nfuture of his unfortunate parishioner. Any good old Roman Catholic\\npriest, born and bred to his faith and his business, would have found a\\nloop-hole into some kind of heaven for her, by virtue of his doctrine of\\n\"invincible ignorance,\" or other special proviso; but a recent convert\\ncannot enter into the working conditions of his new creed. Beliefs must\\nbe lived in for a good while, before they accommodate themselves to the\\nsoul\\'s wants, and wear loose enough to be comfortable.\\n\\nThe Reverend Doctor had no such scruples. Like thousands of those who\\nare classed nominally with the despairing believers, he had never prayed\\nover a departed brother or sister without feeling and expressing a\\nguarded hope that there was mercy in store for the poor sinner, whom\\nparents, wives, children, brothers and sisters could not bear to give up\\nto utter ruin without a word,--and would not, as he knew full well,\\nin virtue of that human love and sympathy which nothing can ever\\nextinguish. And in this poor Elsie\\'s history he could read nothing\\nwhich the tears of the recording angel might not wash away. As the good\\nphysician of the place knew the diseases that assailed the bodies of men\\nand women, so he had learned the mysteries of the sickness of the soul.\\n\\nSo many wished to look upon Elsie\\'s face once more, that her father\\nwould not deny them; nay, he was pleased that those who remembered her\\nliving should see her in the still beauty of death. Helen and those with\\nher arrayed her for this farewell-view. All was ready for the sad or\\ncurious eyes which were to look upon her. There was no painful change to\\nbe concealed by any artifice. Even her round neck was left uncovered,\\nthat she might be more like one who slept. Only the golden cord was left\\nin its place: some searching eye might detect a trace of that birth-mark\\nwhich it was whispered she had always worn a necklace to conceal.\\n\\nAt the last moment, when all the preparations were completed, Old Sophy\\nstooped over her, and, with trembling hand, loosed the golden cord. She\\nlooked intently, for some little space: there was no shade nor blemish\\nwhere the ring of gold had encircled her throat. She took it gently away\\nand laid it in the casket which held her ornaments.\\n\\n\"The Lord be praised!\" the old woman cried, aloud. \"He has taken away\\nthe mark that was on her; she\\'s fit to meet his holy angels now!\"\\n\\nSo Elsie lay for hours in the great room, in a kind of state, with\\nflowers all about her,--her black hair braided, as in life,--her\\nbrows smooth, as if they had never known the scowl of passion,--and\\non her lips the faint smile with which she had uttered her last\\n\"Good-night.\" The young girls from the school looked at her, one after\\nanother, and passed on, sobbing, carrying in their hearts the picture\\nthat would be with them all their days. The great people of the place\\nwere all there with their silent sympathy. The lesser kind of gentry,\\nand many of the plainer folk of the village, half-pleased to find\\nthemselves passing beneath the stately portico of the ancient\\nmansion-house, crowded in, until the ample rooms were overflowing. All\\nthe friends whose acquaintance we have made were there, and many from\\nremoter villages and towns.\\n\\nThere was a deep silence at last. The hour had come for the parting\\nwords to be spoken over the dead. The good old minister\\'s voice rose out\\nof the stillness, subdued and tremulous at first, but growing firmer and\\nclearer as he went on, until it reached the ears of the visitors who\\nwere in the far, desolate chambers, looking at the pictured hangings and\\nthe old dusty portraits. He did not tell her story in his prayer. He\\nonly spoke of our dear departed sister as one of many whom Providence in\\nits wisdom has seen fit to bring under bondage from their cradles. It\\nwas not for us to judge them by any standard of our own. He who made the\\nheart alone knew the infirmities it inherited or acquired. For all that\\nour dear sister had presented that was interesting and attractive in her\\ncharacter we were to be grateful; for whatever was dark or inexplicable\\nwe must trust that the deep shadow which rested on the twilight dawn of\\nher being might render a reason before the bar of Omniscience; for the\\ngrace which had lightened her last days we should pour out our hearts in\\nthankful acknowledgment. From the life and the death of this our dear\\nsister we should learn a lesson of patience with our fellow-creatures in\\ntheir inborn peculiarities, of charity in judging what seem to us wilful\\nfaults of character, of hope and trust, that, by sickness or affliction,\\nor such inevitable discipline as life must always bring with it, if by\\nno gentler means, the soul which had been left by Nature to wander into\\nthe path of error and of suffering might be reclaimed and restored to\\nits true aim, and so led on by divine grace to its eternal welfare. He\\nclosed his prayer by commending each member of the afflicted family to\\nthe divine blessing.\\n\\nThen all at once rose the clear sound of the girls\\' voices, in the\\nsweet, sad melody of a funeral hymn,--one of those which Elsie had\\nmarked, as if prophetically, among her own favorites.\\n\\nAnd so they laid her in the earth, and showered down flowers upon her,\\nand filled her grave, and covered it with green sods. By the side of it\\nwas another oblong ridge, with a white stone standing at its head. Mr.\\nBernard looked upon it, as he came close to the place where Elsie was\\nlaid, and read the inscription,--\\n\\n  CATALINA\\n\\n  WIFE TO DUDLEY VENNER\\n\\n  DIED\\n\\n  OCTOBER 13TH 1840\\n\\n  AGED XX YEARS.\\n\\nA gentle rain fell on the turf after it was laid. This was the beginning\\nof a long and dreary autumnal storm, a deferred \"equinoctial,\" as many\\nconsidered it. The mountain-streams were all swollen and turbulent, and\\nthe steep declivities were furrowed in every direction by new channels.\\nIt made the house seem doubly desolate to hear the wind howling and the\\nrain beating upon the roofs. The poor relation who was staying at the\\nhouse would insist on Helen\\'s remaining a few days: Old Sophy was in\\nsuch a condition, that it kept her in continual anxiety and there were\\nmany cares which Helen could take off from her.\\n\\nThe old black woman\\'s life was buried in her darling\\'s grave. She did\\nnothing but moan and lament for her. At night she was restless, and\\nwould get up and wander to Elsie\\'s apartment and look for her and call\\nher by name. At other times she would lie awake and listen to the wind\\nand the rain,--sometimes with such a wild look upon her face, and with\\nsuch sudden starts and exclamations, that it seemed, as if she heard\\nspirit-voices and were answering the whispers of unseen visitants. With\\nall this were mingled hints of her old superstition,--forebodings of\\nsomething fearful about to happen,--perhaps the great final catastrophe\\nof all things, according to the prediction current in the kitchens of\\nRockland.\\n\\n\"Hark!\" Old Sophy would say,--\"don\\' you hear th\\' crackin\\' \\'n\\' th\\'\\nsnappin\\' up in \\'Th\\' Mountain, \\'n\\' th\\' rollin\\' o\\' th\\' big stones? The\\' \\'s\\nsomethin\\' stirrin\\' among th\\' rocks; I hear th\\' soun\\' of it in th\\' night,\\nwhen th\\' wind has stopped blowin\\'. Oh, stay by me a little while, Miss\\nDarlin\\'! stay by me! for it\\'s th\\' Las\\' Day, may be, that\\'s close on us,\\n\\'n\\' I feel as if I couldn\\' meet th\\' Lord all alone!\"\\n\\nIt was curious,--but Helen did certainly recognize sounds, during the\\nlull of the storm, which were not of falling rain or running streams,\\n--short snapping sounds, as of tense cords breaking,--long uneven\\nsounds, as of masses rolling down steep declivities. But the morning\\ncame as usual; and as the others said nothing of these singular noises,\\nHelen did not think it necessary to speak of them. All day long she\\nand the humble relative of Elsie\\'s mother, who had appeared, as poor\\nrelations are wont to in the great crises of life, were busy in\\narranging the disordered house, and looking over the various objects\\nwhich Elsie\\'s singular tastes had brought together, to dispose of them\\nas her father might direct. They all met together at the usual hour for\\ntea. One of the servants came in, looking very blank, and said to the\\npoor relation,--\\n\\n\"The well is gone dry; we have nothing but rain-water.\"\\n\\nDudley Venner\\'s countenance changed; he sprang to his feet and went to\\nassure himself of the fact, and, if he could, of the reason of it. For\\na well to dry up during such a rain-storm was extraordinary,--it was\\nominous.\\n\\nHe came back, looking very anxious.\\n\\n\"Did any of you notice any remarkable sounds last night,\" he said,--\\n\"or this morning? Hark! do you hear anything now?\"\\n\\nThey listened in perfect silence for a few moments. Then there came a\\nshort cracking sound, and two or three snaps, as of parting cords.\\n\\nDudley Venner called all his household together.\\n\\n\"We are in danger here, as I think, to-night,\" he said,--\"not very\\ngreat danger, perhaps, but it is a risk I do not wish you to run. These\\nheavy rains have loosed some of the rocks above, and they may come down\\nand endanger the house. Harness the horses, Elbridge, and take all the\\nfamily away. Miss Darley will go to the Institute; the others will pass\\nthe night at the Mountain House. I shall stay here, myself: it is not\\nat all likely that anything will come of these warnings; but if there\\nshould, I choose to be here and take my chance.\"\\n\\nIt needs little, generally, to frighten servants, and they were all\\nready enough to go. The poor relation was one of the timid sort, and was\\nterribly uneasy to be got out of the house. This left no alternative, of\\ncourse, for Helen, but to go also. They all urged upon Dudley Venner to\\ngo with them: if there was danger, why should he remain to risk it, when\\nhe sent away the others?\\n\\nOld Sophy said nothing until the time came for her to go with the second\\nof Elbridge\\'s carriage-loads.\\n\\n\"Come, Sophy,\" said Dudley Venner, \"get your things and go. They will\\ntake good care of you at the Mountain House; and when we have made sure\\nthat there is no real danger, you shall come back at once.\"\\n\\n\"No, Massa!\" Sophy answered. \"I\\'ve seen Elsie into th\\' ground, \\'n\\' I\\na\\'n\\'t goin\\' away to come back \\'n\\' fin\\' Massa Venner buried under th\\'\\nrocks. My darlin\\' \\'s gone; \\'n\\' now, if Massa goes, \\'n\\' th\\' ol\\' place\\ngoes, it\\'s time for Ol\\' Sophy to go, too. No, Massa Venner, we\\'ll both\\nstay in th\\' ol\\' mansion \\'n\\' wait for th\\' Lord!\"\\n\\nNothing could change the old woman\\'s determination; and her master, who\\nonly feared, but did not really expect the long-deferred catastrophe,\\nwas obliged to consent to her staying. The sudden drying of the well at\\nsuch a time was the most alarming sign; for he remembered that the same\\nthing had been observed just before great mountain-slides. This long\\nrain, too, was just the kind of cause which was likely to loosen the\\nstrata of rock piled up in the ledges; if the dreaded event should ever\\ncome to pass, it would be at such a time.\\n\\nHe paced his chamber uneasily until long past midnight. If the morning\\ncame without accident, he meant to have a careful examination made of\\nall the rents and fissures above, of their direction and extent, and\\nespecially whether, in case of a mountain-slide, the huge masses would\\nbe like to reach so far to the east and so low down the declivity as the\\nmansion.\\n\\nAt two o\\'clock in the morning he was dozing in his chair. Old Sophy had\\nlain down on her bed, and was muttering in troubled dreams.\\n\\nAll at once a loud crash seemed to rend the very heavens above them: a\\ncrack as of the thunder that follows close upon the bolt,--a rending and\\ncrushing as of a forest snapped through all its stems, torn, twisted,\\nsplintered, dragged with all its ragged boughs into one chaotic ruin.\\nThe ground trembled under them as in an earthquake; the old mansion\\nshuddered so that all its windows chattered in their casements; the\\ngreat chimney shook off its heavy cap-stones, which came down on the\\nroof with resounding concussions; and the echoes of The Mountain roared\\nand bellowed in long reduplication, as if its whole foundations were\\nrent, and this were the terrible voice of its dissolution.\\n\\nDudley Venner rose from his chair, folded his arms, and awaited his\\nfate. There was no knowing where to look for safety; and he remembered\\ntoo well the story of the family that was lost by rushing out of the\\nhouse, and so hurrying into the very jaws of death.\\n\\nHe had stood thus but for a moment, when he heard the voice of Old Sophy\\nin a wild cry of terror:--\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Las\\' Day! It\\'s the Las\\' Day! The Lord is comin\\' to take us\\nall!\"\\n\\n\"Sophy!\" he called; but she did not hear him or heed him, and rushed out\\nof the house.\\n\\nThe worst danger was over. If they were to be destroyed, it would\\nnecessarily be in a few seconds from the first thrill of the terrible\\nconvulsion. He waited in awful suspense, but calm. Not more than one or\\ntwo minutes could have passed before the frightful tumult and all its\\nsounding echoes had ceased. He called Old Sophy; but she did not answer.\\nHe went to the western window and looked forth into the darkness. He\\ncould not distinguish the outlines of the landscape, but the white stone\\nwas clearly visible, and by its side the new-made mound. Nay, what was\\nthat which obscured its outline, in shape like a human figure? He flung\\nopen the window and sprang through. It was all that there was left of\\npoor Old Sophy, stretched out, lifeless, upon her darling\\'s grave.\\n\\nHe had scarcely composed her limbs and drawn the sheet over her, when\\nthe neighbors began to arrive from all directions. Each was expecting to\\nhear of houses overwhelmed and families destroyed; but each came with\\nthe story that his own household was safe. It was not until the morning\\ndawned that the true nature and extent of the sudden movement was\\nascertained. A great seam had opened above the long cliff, and the\\nterrible Rattlesnake Ledge, with all its envenomed reptiles, its\\ndark fissures and black caverns, was buried forever beneath a mighty\\nincumbent mass of ruin.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\nMR. SILAS PECKHAM RENDERS HIS ACCOUNT.\\n\\n\\nThe morning rose clear and bright. The long storm was over, and the calm\\nautumnal sunshine was now to return, with all its infinite repose and\\nsweetness. With the earliest dawn exploring parties were out in every\\ndirection along the southern <DW72> of The Mountain, tracing the ravages\\nof the great slide and the track it had followed. It proved to be not so\\nmuch a slide as the breaking off and falling of a vast line of cliff,\\nincluding the dreaded Ledge. It had folded over like the leaves of a\\nhalf-opened book when they close, crushing the trees below, piling its\\nruins in a glacis at the foot of what had been the overhanging wall of\\nthe cliff, and filling up that deep cavity above the mansion-house which\\nbore the ill-omened name of Dead Man\\'s Hollow. This it was which had\\nsaved the Dudley mansion. The falling masses, or huge fragments\\nbreaking off from them, would have swept the house and all around it to\\ndestruction but for this deep shelving dell, into which the stream of\\nruin was happily directed. It was, indeed, one of Nature\\'s conservative\\nrevolutions; for the fallen masses made a kind of shelf, which\\ninterposed a level break between the inclined planes above and below it,\\nso that the nightmare-fancies of the dwellers in the Dudley mansion, and\\nin many other residences under the shadow of The Mountain, need not keep\\nthem lying awake hereafter to listen for the snapping of roots and the\\nsplitting of the rocks above them.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours after the falling of the cliff, it seemed as if it had\\nhappened ages ago. The new fact had fitted itself in with all the old\\npredictions, forebodings, fears, and acquired the solidarity belonging\\nto all events which have slipped out of the fingers of Time and\\ndissolved in the antecedent eternity.\\n\\nOld Sophy was lying dead in the Dudley mansion. If there were tears shed\\nfor her, they could not be bitter ones; for she had lived out her full\\nmeasure of days, and gone--who could help fondly believing it?--to\\nrejoin her beloved mistress. They made a place for her at the foot of\\nthe two mounds. It was thus she would have chosen to sleep, and not to\\nhave wronged her humble devotion in life by asking to lie at the side of\\nthose whom she had served so long and faithfully. There were very few\\npresent at the simple ceremony. Helen Darley was one of these few. The\\nold black woman had been her companion in all the kind offices of which\\nshe had been the ministering angel to Elsie.\\n\\nAfter it was all over, Helen was leaving with the rest, when Dudley\\nVenner begged her to stay a little, and he would send her back: it was\\na long walk; besides, he wished to say some things to her, which he had\\nnot had the opportunity of speaking. Of course Helen could not refuse\\nhim; there must be many thoughts coming into his mind which he would\\nwish to share with her who had known his daughter so long and been with\\nher in her last days.\\n\\nShe returned into the great parlor with the wrought cornices and the\\nmedallion-portraits on the ceiling.\\n\\n\"I am now alone in the world,\" Dudley Venner said.\\n\\nHelen must have known that before he spoke. But the tone in which he\\nsaid it had so much meaning, that she could not find a word to answer\\nhim with. They sat in silence, which the old tall clock counted out in\\nlong seconds; but it was a silence which meant more than any words they\\nhad ever spoken.\\n\\n\"Alone in the world! Helen, the freshness of my life is gone, and there\\nis little left of the few graces which in my younger days might have\\nfitted me to win the love of women. Listen to me,--kindly, if you can;\\nforgive me, at least. Half my life has been passed in constant fear and\\nanguish, without any near friend to share my trials. My task is done\\nnow; my fears have ceased to prey upon me; the sharpness of early\\nsorrows has yielded something of its edge to time. You have bound me to\\nyou by gratitude in the tender care you have taken of my poor child.\\nMore than this. I must tell you all now, out of the depth of this\\ntrouble through which I am passing. I have loved you from the moment\\nwe first met; and if my life has anything left worth accepting, it is\\nyours. Will you take the offered gift?\"\\n\\nHelen looked in his face, surprised, bewildered.\\n\\n\"This is not for me,--not for me,\" she said. \"I am but a poor faded\\nflower, not worth the gathering of such a one as you. No, no,--I have\\nbeen bred to humble toil all my days, and I could not be to you what\\nyou ought to ask. I am accustomed to a kind of loneliness and\\nself-dependence. I have seen nothing, almost, of the world, such as you\\nwere born to move in. Leave me to my obscure place and duties; I shall\\nat least have peace;--and you--you will surely find in due time some one\\nbetter fitted by Nature and training to make you happy.\"\\n\\n\"No, Miss Darley!\" Dudley Venner said, almost sternly. \"You must not\\nspeak to a man who has lived through my experiences of looking about for\\na new choice after his heart has once chosen. Say that you can never\\nlove me; say that I have lived too long to share your young life; say\\nthat sorrow has left nothing in me for Love to find his pleasure in; but\\ndo not mock me with the hope of a new affection for some unknown object.\\nThe first look of yours brought me to your side. The first tone of your\\nvoice sunk into my heart. From this moment my life must wither out or\\nbloom anew. My home is desolate. Come under my roof and make it bright\\nonce more,--share my life with me,--or I shall give the halls of the old\\nmansion to the bats and the owls, and wander forth alone without a hope\\nor a friend!\"\\n\\nTo find herself with a man\\'s future at the disposal of a single word of\\nhers!--a man like this, too, with a fascination for her against which\\nshe had tried to shut her heart, feeling that he lived in another sphere\\nthan hers, working as she was for her bread, a poor operative in the\\nfactory of a hard master and jealous overseer, the salaried drudge of\\nMr. Silas Peckham! Why, she had thought he was grateful to her as a\\nfriend of his daughter; she had even pleased herself with the feeling\\nthat he liked her, in her humble place, as a woman of some cultivation\\nand many sympathetic! points of relation with himself; but that he\\n_loved_ her,--that this deep, fine nature, in a man so far removed from\\nher in outward circumstance, should have found its counterpart in one\\nwhom life had treated so coldly as herself,--that Dudley Venner should\\nstake his happiness on a breath of hers,--poor Helen Darley\\'s,--it was\\nall a surprise, a confusion, a kind of fear not wholly fearful. Ah, me!\\nwomen know what it is,--that mist over the eyes, that trembling in the\\nlimbs, that faltering of the voice, that sweet, shame-faced, unspoken\\nconfession of weakness which does not wish to be strong, that sudden\\noverflow in the soul where thoughts loose their hold on each other and\\nswim single and helpless in the flood of emotion,--women know what it\\nis!\\n\\nNo doubt she was a little frightened and a good deal bewildered, and\\nthat her sympathies were warmly excited for a friend to whom she had\\nbeen brought so near, and whose loneliness she saw and pitied. She lost\\nthat calm self-possession she had hoped to maintain.\\n\\n\"If I thought that I could make you happy,--if I should speak from my\\nheart, and not my reason,--I am but a weak woman,--yet if I can be to\\nyou--What can I say?\"\\n\\nWhat more could this poor, dear Helen say?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\"Elbridge, harness the horses and take Miss Darley back to the school.\"\\n\\nWhat conversation had taken place since Helen\\'s rhetorical failure is\\nnot recorded in the minutes from which this narrative is constructed.\\nBut when the man who had been summoned had gone to get the carriage\\nready, Helen resumed something she had been speaking of.\\n\\n\"Not for the world! Everything must go on just as it has gone on, for\\nthe present. There are proprieties to be consulted. I cannot be\\nhard with you, that out of your very affliction has sprung\\nthis--this--well--you must name it for me,--but the world will never\\nlisten to explanations. I am to be Helen Darley, lady assistant in Mr.\\nSilas Peckham\\'s school, as long as I see fit to hold my office. And I\\nmean to attend to my scholars just as before; so that I shall have very\\nlittle time for visiting or seeing company. I believe, though, you are\\none of the Trustees and a Member of the Examining Committee; so that, if\\nyou should happen to visit the school, I shall try to be civil to you.\"\\n\\nEvery lady sees, of course, that Helen was quite right; but perhaps here\\nand there one will think that Dudley Venner was all wrong,--that he was\\ntoo hasty,--that he should have been too full of his recent grief for\\nsuch a confession as he has just made, and the passion from which it\\nsprung. Perhaps they do not understand the sudden recoil of a strong\\nnature long compressed. Perhaps they have not studied the mystery of\\n_allotropism_ in the emotions of the human heart. Go to the nearest\\nchemist and ask him to show you some of the dark-red phosphorus which\\nwill not burn, without fierce heating, but at 500 deg., Fahrenheit, changes\\nback again to the inflammable substance we know so well. Grief seems\\nmore like ashes than like fire; but as grief has been love once, so it\\nmay become love again. This is emotional allotropism.\\n\\nHelen rode back to the Institute and inquired for Mr. Peckham. She had\\nnot seen him during the brief interval between her departure from the\\nmansion-house and her return to Old Sophy\\'s funeral. There were various\\nquestions about the school she wished to ask.\\n\\n\"Oh, how\\'s your haaelth, Miss Darley?\" Silas began. \"We\\'ve missed you\\nconsid\\'able. Glad to see you back at the post of dooty. Hope the Squire\\ntreated you hahnsomely,--liberal pecooniary compensation,--hey? A\\'n\\'t\\nmuch of a loser, I guess, by acceptin\\' his propositions?\"\\n\\nHelen blushed at this last question, as if Silas had meant something by\\nit beyond asking what money she had received; but his own double-meaning\\nexpression and her blush were too nice points for him to have taken\\ncognizance of. He was engaged in a mental calculation as to the amount\\nof the deduction he should make under the head of \"damage to the\\ninstitootion,\"--this depending somewhat on that of the \"pecooniary\\ncompensation\" she might have received for her services as the friend of\\nElsie Venner.\\n\\nSo Helen slid back at once into her routine, the same faithful, patient\\ncreature she had always been. But what was this new light which seemed\\nto have kindled in her eyes? What was this look of peace, which nothing\\ncould disturb, which smiled serenely through all the little meannesses\\nwith which the daily life of the educational factory surrounded\\nher,--which not only made her seem resigned, but overflowed all her\\nfeatures with a thoughtful, subdued happiness? Mr. Bernard did not\\nknow,--perhaps he did not guess. The inmates of the Dudley mansion were\\nnot scandalized by any mysterious visits of a veiled or unveiled lady.\\nThe vibrating tongues of the \"female youth\" of the Institute were not\\nset in motion by the standing of an equipage at the gate, waiting for\\ntheir lady teacher. The servants at the mansion did not convey numerous\\nletters with superscriptions in a bold, manly hand, sealed with the arms\\nof a well-known house, and directed to Miss Helen Darley; nor, on the\\nother hand, did Hiram, the man from the lean streak in New Hampshire,\\ncarry sweet-smelling, rose-hued, many-layered, criss-crossed,\\nfine-stitch-lettered packages of note-paper directed to Dudley Venner,\\nEsq., and all too scanty to hold that incredible expansion of the famous\\nthree words which a woman was born to say,--that perpetual miracle which\\nastonishes all the go-betweens who wear their shoes out in carrying a\\nwoman\\'s infinite variations on the theme, \"I love you.\"\\n\\nBut the reader must remember that there are walks in country-towns where\\npeople are liable to meet by accident, and that the hollow of an old\\ntree has served the purpose of a post-office sometimes; so that he has\\nher choice (to divide the pronouns impartially) of various hypotheses to\\naccount for the new glory of happiness which seemed to have irradiated\\nour poor Helen\\'s features, as if her dreary life were awakening in the\\ndawn of a blessed future.\\n\\nWith all the alleviations which have been hinted at, Mr. Dudley Venner\\nthought that the days and the weeks had never moved so slowly as through\\nthe last period of the autumn that was passing. Elsie had been a\\nperpetual source of anxiety to him, but still she had been a companion.\\nHe could not mourn for her; for he felt that she was safer with her\\nmother, in that world where there are no more sorrows and dangers, than\\nshe could have been with him. But as he sat at his window and looked at\\nthe three mounds, the loneliness of the great house made it seem more\\nlike the sepulchre than these narrow dwellings where his beloved and her\\ndaughter lay close to each other, side by side,--Catalina, the bride\\nof his youth, and Elsie, the child whom he had nurtured, with poor Old\\nSophy, who had followed them like a black shadow, at their feet, under\\nthe same soft turf, sprinkled with the brown autumnal leaves. It was not\\ngood for him to be thus alone. How should he ever live through the long\\nmonths of November and December?\\n\\nThe months of November and December did, in some way or other, get\\nrid of themselves at last, bringing with them the usual events of\\nvillage-life and a few unusual ones. Some of the geologists had been up\\nto look at the great slide, of which they gave those prolix accounts\\nwhich everybody remembers who read the scientific journals of the time.\\nThe engineers reported that there was little probability of any further\\nconvulsion along the line of rocks which overhung the more thickly\\nsettled part of the town. The naturalists drew up a paper on the\\n\"Probable Extinction of the _Crotalus Durissus_ in the Township of\\nRockland.\" The engagement of the Widow Rowens to a Little Millionville\\nmerchant was announced,--\"Sudding \\'n\\' onexpected,\" Widow Leech\\nsaid,--\"waaelthy, or she wouldn\\'t ha\\' looked at him,--fifty year old, if\\nhe is a day, _\\'n\\' ha\\'n\\'t got a white hair in his head.\"_ The Reverend\\nChauncy Fairweather had publicly announced that he was going to join the\\nRoman Catholic communion,--not so much to the surprise or consternation\\nof the religious world as he had supposed. Several old ladies forthwith\\nproclaimed their intention of following him; but, as one or two of them\\nwere deaf, and another had been threatened with an attack of that mild,\\nbut obstinate complaint, _dementia senilis_, many thought it was not so\\nmuch the force of his arguments as a kind of tendency to jump as the\\nbellwether jumps, well known in flocks not included in the Christian\\nfold. His bereaved congregation immediately began pulling candidates on\\nand off, like new boots, on trial. Some pinched in tender places; some\\nwere too loose; some were too square-toed; some were too coarse, and\\ndidn\\'t please; some were too thin, and wouldn\\'t last;--in short, they\\ncouldn\\'t possibly find a fit. At last people began to drop in to hear\\nold Doctor Honeywood. They were quite surprised to find what a human old\\ngentleman he was, and went back and told the others, that, instead of\\nbeing a case of confluent sectarianism, as they supposed, the good old\\nminister had been so well vaccinated with charitable virus that he was\\nnow a true, open-souled Christian of the mildest type. The end of all\\nwhich was, that the liberal people went over to the old minister almost\\nin a body, just at the time that Deacon Shearer and the \"Vinegar-Bible\"\\nparty split off, and that not long afterwards they sold their own\\nmeeting-house to the malecontents, so that Deacon Soper used often to\\nremind Colonel Sprowle of his wish that \"our little man and him [the\\nReverend Doctor] would swop pulpits,\" and tell him it had \"pooty nigh\\ncome trew.\"--But this is anticipating the course of events, which were\\nmuch longer in coming about; for we have but just got through that\\nterribly long month, as Mr. Dudley Venner found it, of December.\\n\\nOn the first of January, Mr. Silas Peckham was in the habit of settling\\nhis quarterly accounts, and making such new arrangements as his\\nconvenience or interest dictated. New-Year was a holiday at the\\nInstitute. No doubt this accounted for Helen\\'s being dressed so\\ncharmingly,--always, to be sure, in her own simple way, but yet with\\nsuch a true lady\\'s air that she looked fit to be the mistress of any\\nmansion in the land.\\n\\nShe was in the parlor alone, a little before noon, when Mr. Peckham came\\nin.\\n\\n\"I\\'m ready to settle my account with you now, Miss Darley,\" said Silas.\\n\\n\"As you please, Mr. Peckham,\" Helen answered, very graciously.\\n\\n\"Before payin\\' you your selary,\" the Principal continued, \"I wish to\\ncome to an understandin\\' as to the futur\\'. I consider that I\\'ve been\\npayin\\' high, very high, for the work you do. Women\\'s wages can\\'t be\\nexpected to do more than feed and clothe \\'em, as a gineral thing, with\\na little savin\\', in case of sickness, and to bury \\'em, if they\\nbreak daown, as all of \\'em are liable to do at any time. If I a\\'n\\'t\\nmisinformed, you not only support yourself out of my establishment, but\\nlikewise relatives of yours, who I don\\'t know that I\\'m called upon to\\nfeed and clothe. There is a young woman, not burdened with destitoot\\nrelatives, has signified that she would be glad to take your dooties for\\nless pecooniary compensation, by a consid\\'able amaount, than you now\\nreceive. I shall be willin\\', however, to retain your services at sech\\nredooced rate as we shall fix upon,--provided sech redooced rate be as\\nlow or lower than the same services can be obtained elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"As you please, Mr. Peckham,\" Helen answered, with a smile so sweet that\\nthe Principal (who of course had trumped up this opposition-teacher for\\nthe occasion) said to himself she would stand being cut down a quarter,\\nperhaps a half, of her salary.\\n\\n\"Here is your accaount, Miss Darley, and the balance doo you,\"\\nsaid Silas Peckham, handing her a paper and a small roll of\\ninfectious-flavored bills wrapping six poisonous coppers of the old\\ncoinage.\\n\\nShe took the paper and began looking at it. She could not quite make up\\nher mind to touch the feverish bills with the cankering copper in them,\\nand left them airing themselves on the table.\\n\\nThe document she held ran as follows:\\n\\n  _Silas Peckham, Esq., Principal of the Apollinean Institute,\\n  In Account with Helen Darley, Assist. Teacher._\\n\\n  _Dr._\\n  To Salary for quarter ending Jan. 1st,\\n  @ $75 per quarter  .  .  .  .  .  . $75.00\\n\\n  ______\\n  $75.00\\n\\n  _Cr._\\n  By Deduction for absence, 1 week 8\\n  days   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . $10.00\\n  \" Board, lodging, etc., for 10 days,\\n  @ 75 cts. per day  .  .  .  .  .  .   7.50\\n  \" Damage to Institution by absence\\n  of teacher from duties, say .  .  .  25.00\\n  \" Stationery furnished .  .  .  .  .    43\\n  \" Postage-stamp  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    01\\n  \" Balance due Helen Darley   .  .   $32.06\\n  ______\\n  $75.00\\n\\n  ROCKLAND, Jan. 1st, 1859.\\n\\nNow Helen had her own private reasons for wishing to receive the\\nsmall sum which was due her at this time without any unfair\\ndeduction,--reasons which we need not inquire into too particularly,\\nas we may be very sure that they were right and womanly. So, when she\\nlooked over this account of Mr. Silas Peckham\\'s, and saw that he had\\ncontrived to pare down her salary to something less than half its\\nstipulated amount, the look which her countenance wore was as near to\\nthat of righteous indignation as her gentle features and soft blue eyes\\nwould admit of its being.\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Peckham,\" she said, \"do you mean this? If I am of so much\\nvalue to you that you must take off twenty-five dollars for ten days\\'\\nabsence, how is it that my salary is to be cut down to less than\\nseventy-five dollars a quarter, if I remain here?\"\\n\\n\"I gave you fair notice,\" said Silas. \"I have a minute of it I took down\\nimmed\\'ately after the intervoo.\"\\n\\nHe lugged out his large pocket-book with the strap going all round it,\\nand took from it a slip of paper which confirmed his statement.\\n\\n\"Besides,\" he added, slyly, \"I presoom you have received a liberal\\npecooniary compensation from Squire Venner for nussin\\' his daughter.\"\\n\\nHelen was looking over the bill while he was speaking.\\n\\n\"Board and lodging for ten days, Mr. Peckham,--_whose_ board and\\nlodging, pray?\"\\n\\nThe door opened before Silas Peckham could answer, and Mr. Bernard\\nwalked into the parlor. Helen was holding the bill in her hand, looking\\nas any woman ought to look who has been at once wronged and insulted.\\n\\n\"The last turn of the thumbscrew!\" said Mr. Bernard to himself. \"What is\\nit, Helen? You look troubled.\"\\n\\nShe handed him the account.\\n\\nHe looked at the footing of it. Then he looked at the items. Then he\\nlooked at Silas Peckham.\\n\\nAt this moment Silas was sublime. He was so transcendency unconscious of\\nthe emotions going on in Mr. Bernard\\'s mind at the moment, that he had\\nonly a single thought.\\n\\n\"The accaount\\'s correc\\'ly cast, I presoom;--if the\\' \\'s any mistake\\nof figgers or addin\\' \\'em up, it\\'ll be made all right. Everything\\'s\\naccordin\\' to agreement. The minute written immed\\'ately after the\\nintervoo is here in my possession.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard looked at Helen. Just what would have happened to Silas\\nPeckham, as he stood then and there, but for the interposition of a\\nmerciful Providence, nobody knows or ever will know; for at that moment\\nsteps were heard upon the stairs, and Hiram threw open the parlor-door\\nfor Mr. Dudley Venner to enter.\\n\\nHe saluted them all gracefully with the good-wishes of the season, and\\neach of them returned his compliment,--Helen blushing fearfully, of\\ncourse, but not particularly noticed in her embarrassment by more than\\none.\\n\\nSilas Peckham reckoned with perfect confidence on his Trustees, who had\\nalways said what he told them to, and done what he wanted. It was a good\\nchance now to show off his power, and, by letting his instructors know\\nthe unstable tenure of their offices, make it easier to settle his\\naccounts and arrange his salaries. There was nothing very strange in Mr.\\nVenner\\'s calling; he was one of the Trustees, and this was New Year\\'s\\nDay. But he had called just at the lucky moment for Mr. Peckham\\'s\\nobject.\\n\\n\"I have thought some of makin\\' changes in the department of\\ninstruction,\" he began. \"Several accomplished teachers have applied to\\nme, who would be glad of sitooations. I understand that there never have\\nbeen so many fust-rate teachers, male and female, out of employment as\\ndoorin\\' the present season. If I can make sahtisfahctory arrangements\\nwith my present corpse of teachers, I shall be glad to do so; otherwise\\nI shell, with the permission of the Trustees, make sech noo arrangements\\nas circumstahnces compel.\"\\n\\n\"You may make arrangements for a new assistant in my department, Mr.\\nPeckham,\" said Mr. Bernard, \"at once,--this day,--this hour. I am not\\nsafe to be trusted with your person five minutes out of this lady\\'s\\npresence,--of whom I beg pardon for this strong language. Mr. Venner, I\\nmust beg you, as one of the Trustees of this Institution, to look at the\\nmanner in which its Principal has attempted to swindle this faithful\\nteacher, whose toils and sacrifices and self-devotion to the school\\nhave made it all that it is, in spite of this miserable trader\\'s\\nincompetence. Will you look at the paper I hold?\"\\n\\nDudley Venner took the account and read it through, without changing a\\nfeature. Then he turned to Silas Peckham.\\n\\n\"You may make arrangements for a new assistant in the branches this lady\\nhas taught. Miss Helen Darley is to be my wife. I had hoped to announce\\nthis news in a less abrupt and ungraceful manner. But I came to tell\\nyou with my own lips what you would have learned before evening from my\\nfriends in the village.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard went to Helen, who stood silent, with downcast eyes, and\\ntook her hand warmly, hoping she might find all the happiness she\\ndeserved. Then he turned to Dudley Venner, and said,--\\n\\n\"She is a queen, but has never found it out. The world has nothing\\nnobler than this dear woman, whom you have discovered in the disguise of\\na teacher. God bless her and you!\"\\n\\nDudley Venner returned his friendly grasp, without answering a word in\\narticulate speech.\\n\\nSilas remained dumb and aghast for a brief space. Coming to himself\\na little, he thought there might have been some mistake about the\\nitems,--would like to have Miss Darley\\'s bill returned,--would make it\\nall right,--had no idee that Squire Venner had a special int\\'rest in\\nMiss Darley,--was sorry he had given offence,--if he might take that\\nbill and look it over--\\n\\n\"No, Mr. Peckham,\" said Mr. Dudley Venner; \"there will be a full meeting\\nof the Board next week, and the bill, and such evidence with reference\\nto the management of the Institution and the treatment of its\\ninstructors as Mr. Langdon sees fit to bring forward, will be laid\\nbefore them.\"\\n\\nMiss Helen Darley became that very day the guest of Miss Arabella\\nThornton, the Judge\\'s daughter. Mr. Bernard made his appearance a week\\nor two later at the Lectures, where the Professor first introduced him\\nto the reader.\\n\\nHe stayed after the class had left the room.\\n\\n\"Ah, Mr. Langdon! how do you do? Very glad to see you back again. How\\nhave you been since our correspondence on Fascination and other curious\\nscientific questions?\"\\n\\nIt was the Professor who spoke,--whom the reader will recognize as\\nmyself, the teller of this story.\\n\\n\"I have been well,\" Mr. Bernard answered, with a serious look which\\ninvited a further question.\\n\\n\"I hope you have had none of those painful or dangerous experiences you\\nseemed to be thinking of when you wrote; at any rate, you have escaped\\nhaving your obituary written.\"\\n\\n\"I have seen some things worth remembering. Shall I call on you this\\nevening and tell you about them?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be most happy to see you.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis was the way in which I, the Professor, became acquainted with some\\nof the leading events of this story. They interested me sufficiently\\nto lead me to avail myself of all those other extraordinary methods of\\nobtaining information well known to writers of narrative.\\n\\nMr. Langdon seemed to me to have gained in seriousness and strength of\\ncharacter by his late experiences. He threw his whole energies into\\nhis studies with an effect which distanced all his previous efforts.\\nRemembering my former hint, he employed his spare hours in writing for\\nthe annual prizes, both of which he took by a unanimous vote of the\\njudges. Those who heard him read his Thesis at the Medical Commencement\\nwill not soon forget the impression made by his fine personal appearance\\nand manners, nor the universal interest excited in the audience, as\\nhe read, with his beautiful enunciation, that striking paper entitled\\n\"Unresolved Nebulas in Vital Science.\" It was a general remark of the\\nFaculty,--and old Doctor Kittredge, who had come down on purpose to hear\\nMr. Langdon, heartily agreed to it,--that there had never been a diploma\\nfilled up, since the institution which conferred upon him the degree of\\n_Doctor Medicinae_ was founded, which carried with it more of promise to\\nthe profession than that which bore the name of\\n\\nBernardus Caryl Langdon\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\nCONCLUSION.\\n\\n\\nMr. Bernard Langdon had no sooner taken his degree, than, in accordance\\nwith the advice of one of his teachers whom he frequently consulted, he\\ntook an office in the heart of the city where he had studied. He had\\nthought of beginning in a suburb or some remoter district of the city\\nproper.\\n\\n\"No,\" said his teacher,--to wit, myself,--\"don\\'t do any such thing. You\\nare made for the best kind of practice; don\\'t hamper yourself with an\\noutside constituency, such as belongs to a practitioner of the second\\nclass. When a fellow like you chooses his beat, he must look ahead a\\nlittle. Take care of all the poor that apply to you, but leave the\\nhalf-pay classes to a different style of doctor,--the people who spend\\none half their time in taking care of their patients, and the other half\\nin squeezing out their money. Go for the swell-fronts and south-exposure\\nhouses; the folks inside are just as good as other people, and the\\npleasantest, on the whole, to take care of. They must have somebody, and\\nthey like a gentleman best. Don\\'t throw yourself away. You have a\\ngood presence and pleasing manners. You wear white linen by inherited\\ninstinct. You can pronounce the word _view_. You have all the elements\\nof success; go and take it. Be polite and generous, but don\\'t undervalue\\nyourself. You will be useful, at any rate; you may just as well be\\nhappy, while you are about it. The highest social class furnishes\\nincomparably the best patients, taking them by and large. Besides, when\\nthey won\\'t get well and bore you to death, you can send \\'em off to\\ntravel. Mind me now, and take the tops of your sparrowgrass. Somebody\\nmust have \\'em,--why shouldn\\'t you? If you don\\'t take your chance, you\\'ll\\nget the butt-ends as a matter of course.\"\\n\\nMr. Bernard talked like a young man full of noble sentiments. He wanted\\nto be useful to his fellow-beings. Their social differences were nothing\\nto him. He would never court the rich,--he would go where he was called.\\nHe would rather save the life of a poor mother of a family than that of\\nhalf a dozen old gouty millionnaires whose heirs had been yawning and\\nstretching these ten years to get rid of them.\\n\\n\"Generous emotions!\" I exclaimed. \"Cherish \\'em; cling to \\'em till you\\nare fifty,--till you are seventy,--till you are ninety! But do as I tell\\nyou,--strike for the best circle of practice, and you\\'ll be sure to get\\nit!\"\\n\\nMr. Langdon did as I told him,--took a genteel office, furnished it\\nneatly, dressed with a certain elegance, soon made a pleasant circle\\nof acquaintances, and began to work his way into the right kind of\\nbusiness. I missed him, however, for some days, not long after he had\\nopened his office. On his return, he told me he had been up at Rockland,\\nby special invitation, to attend the wedding of Mr. Dudley Venner and\\nMiss Helen Darley. He gave me a full account of the ceremony, which\\nI regret that I cannot relate in full. \"Helen looked like an\\nangel,\"--that, I am sure, was one of his expressions. As for her dress,\\nI should like to give the details, but am afraid of committing blunders,\\nas men always do, when they undertake to describe such matters. White\\ndress, anyhow,--that I am sure of,--with orange-flowers, and the most\\nwonderful lace veil that was ever seen or heard of. The Reverend Doctor\\nHoneywood performed the ceremony, of course. The good people seemed to\\nhave forgotten they ever had had any other minister,--except Deacon\\nShearer and his set of malecontents, who were doing a dull business in\\nthe meeting-house lately occupied by the Reverend Mr. Fairweather.\\n\\n\"Who was at the wedding?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody, pretty much. They wanted to keep it quiet, but it was of no\\nuse. Married at church. Front pews, old Doctor Kittredge and all the\\nmansion-house people and distinguished strangers,--Colonel Sprowle and\\nfamily, including Matilda\\'s young gentleman, a graduate of one of\\nthe fresh-water colleges,--Mrs. Pickins (late Widow Rowens) and\\nhusband,--Deacon Soper and numerous parishioners. A little nearer the\\ndoor, Abel, the Doctor\\'s man, and Elbridge, who drove them to church in,\\nthe family-coach. Father Fairweather, as they all call him now, came in\\nlate, with Father McShane.\"\\n\\n\"And Silas Peckham?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Silas had left The School and Rockland. Cut up altogether too\\nbadly in the examination instituted by the Trustees. Had moved over\\nto Tamarack, and thought of renting a large house and \\'farming\\' the\\ntown-poor.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSome time after this, as I was walking with a young friend along by the\\nswell-fronts and south-exposures, whom should I see but Mr. Bernard\\nLangdon, looking remarkably happy, and keeping step by the side of a\\nvery handsome and singularly well-dressed young lady? He bowed and\\nlifted his hat as we passed.\\n\\n\"Who is that pretty girl my young doctor has got there?\" I said to my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"Who is that?\" he answered. \"You don\\'t know? Why, that is neither more\\nnor less than Miss Letitia Forester, daughter of--of--why, the great\\nbanking-firm, you know, Bilyuns Brothers & Forester. Got acquainted with\\nher in the country, they say. There\\'s a story that they\\'re engaged, or\\nlike to be, if the firm consents.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" I said.\\n\\nI did not like the look of it in the least. Too young,--too young. Has\\nnot taken any position yet. No right to ask for the hand of Bilyuns\\nBrothers & Co.\\'s daughter. Besides, it will spoil him for practice, if\\nhe marries a rich girl before he has formed habits of work.\\n\\nI looked in at his office the next day. A box of white kids was lying\\nopen on the table. A three-cornered note, directed in a very delicate\\nlady\\'s-hand, was distinguishable among a heap of papers. I was just\\ngoing to call him to account for his proceedings, when he pushed\\nthe three-cornered note aside and took up a letter with a great\\ncorporation-seal upon it. He had received the offer of a professor\\'s\\nchair in an ancient and distinguished institution.\\n\\n\"Pretty well for three-and-twenty, my boy,\" I said. \"I suppose you\\'ll\\nthink you must be married one of these days, if you accept this office.\"\\n\\nMr. Langdon blushed.--There had been stories about him, he knew. His\\nname had been mentioned in connection with that of a very charming young\\nlady. The current reports were not true. He had met this young lady,\\nand been much pleased with her, in the country, at the house of her\\ngrandfather, the Reverend Doctor Honeywood,--you remember Miss Letitia\\nForester, whom I have mentioned repeatedly? On coming to town, he found\\nhis country-acquaintance in a social position which seemed to discourage\\nhis continued intimacy. He had discovered, however, that he was a not\\nunwelcome visitor, and had kept up friendly relations with her. But\\nthere was no truth in the current reports,--none at all.\\n\\nSome months had passed, after this visit, when I happened one evening to\\nstroll into a box in one of the principal theatres of the city. A small\\nparty sat on the seats before me: a middle-aged gentleman and his lady,\\nin front, and directly behind them my young doctor and the same very\\nhandsome young lady I had seen him walking with on the side-walk before\\nthe swell-fronts and south-exposures. As Professor Langdon seemed to be\\nvery much taken up with his companion, and both of them looked as if\\nthey were enjoying themselves, I determined not to make my presence\\nknown to my young friend, and to withdraw quietly after feasting my eyes\\nwith the sight of them for a few minutes.\\n\\n\"It looks as if something might come of it,\" I said to myself.\\n\\nAt that moment the young lady lifted her arm accidentally, in such a way\\nthat the light fell upon the clasp of a chain which encircled her wrist.\\nMy eyes filled with tears as I read upon the clasp, in sharp-cut Italic\\nletters, _E.V._ They were tears at once of sad remembrance and of joyous\\nanticipation; for the ornament on which I looked was the double\\npledge of a dead sorrow and a living affection. It was the golden\\nbracelet,--the parting-gift of Elsie Venner.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nBUBBLES.\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\n  I stood on the brink in childhood,\\n  And watched the bubbles go\\n  From the rock-fretted sunny ripple\\n  To the smoother lymph below;\\n\\n  And over the white creek-bottom,\\n  Under them every one,\\n  Went golden stars in the water,\\n  All luminous with the sun.\\n\\n  But the bubbles brake on the surface,\\n  And under, the stars of gold\\n  Brake, and the hurrying water\\n  Flowed onward, swift and cold.\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\n  I stood on the brink in manhood,\\n  And it came to my weary heart,--\\n  In my breast so dull and heavy,\\n  After the years of smart,--\\n\\n  That every hollowest bubble\\n  Which over my life had passed\\n  Still into its deeper current\\n  Some sky-sweet gleam had cast;\\n\\n  That, however I mocked it gayly,\\n  And guessed at its hollowness,\\n  Still shone, with each bursting bubble,\\n  One star in my soul the less.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES AND PARKS:\\n\\nWITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NEW YORK CENTRAL PARK.\\n\\n\\nThe first murderer was the first city-builder; and a good deal of\\nmurdering has been carried on in the interest of city-building ever\\nsince Cain\\'s day. Narrow and crooked streets, want of proper sewerage\\nand ventilation, the absence of forethought in providing open spaces for\\nthe recreation of the people, the allowance of intramural burials,\\nand of fetid nuisances, such as slaughter-houses and manufactories of\\noffensive stuffs, have converted cities into pestilential inclosures,\\nand kept Jefferson\\'s saying--\"Great cities are great sores\"--true in its\\nmost literal and mortifying sense.\\n\\nThere is some excuse for the crowded and irregular character of\\nOld-World cities. They grew, and were not builded. Accumulations\\nof people, who lighted like bees upon a chance branch, they found\\nthemselves hived in obdurate brick and mortar before they knew it; and\\nthen, to meet the necessities of their cribbed, cabined, and confined\\ncondition, they must tear down sacred landmarks, sacrifice invaluable\\npossessions, and trample on prescriptive rights, to provide\\nbreathing-room for their gasping population. Besides, air, water, light,\\nand cleanliness are modern innovations. The nose seems to have acquired\\nits sensitiveness within a hundred years,--the lungs their objection to\\nfoul air, and the palate its disgust at ditch-water like the Thames,\\nwithin a more recent period. Honestly dirty, and robustly indifferent to\\nwhat mortally offends our squeamish senses, our happy ancestors fattened\\non carbonic acid gas, and took the exhalations of graveyards and gutters\\nwith a placidity of stomach that excites our physiological admiration.\\nIf they died, it was not for want of air. The pestilence carried, them\\noff,--and that was a providential enemy, whose home-bred origin nobody\\nsuspected.\\n\\nIt must seem to foreigners of all things the strangest, that, in a\\ncountry where land is sold at one dollar and twenty-five cents the acre\\nby the square mile, there should in any considerable part of it be a\\nwant of room,--any necessity for crowding the population into pent-up\\ncities,--any narrowness of streets, or want of commons and parks. And\\nyet it is an undeniable truth that our American cities are all suffering\\nthe want of ample thoroughfares, destitute of adequate parks and\\ncommons, and too much crowded for health, convenience, or beauty. Boston\\nhas for its main street a serpentine lane, wide enough to drive the cows\\nhome from their pastures, but totally and almost fatally inadequate\\nto be the great artery of a city of two hundred thousand people.\\nPhiladelphia is little better off with her narrow Chestnut Street,\\nwhich purchases what accommodation it affords by admitting the parallel\\nstreets to nearly equal use, and thus sacrificing the very idea of a\\nmetropolitan thoroughfare, in which the splendor and motion and life\\nof a metropolis ought to be concentrated. New York succeeds in making\\nBroadway what the Toledo, the Strand, the Linden Strasse, the Italian\\nBoulevards are; but the street is notoriously blocked and confused, and\\noccasions more loss of time and temper and life and limb than would\\namply repay, once in five years, the widening of it to double its\\npresent breadth.\\n\\nIt is a great misfortune, that our commercial metropolis, the\\npredestined home of five millions of people, should not have a single\\nstreet worthy of the population, the wealth, the architectural ambition\\nready to fill and adorn it. Wholesale trade, bankers, brokers, and\\nlawyers seek narrow streets. There must be swift communication between\\nthe opposite sides, and easy recognition of faces across the way. But\\nretail trade requires no such conditions. The passers up and down on\\nopposite sides of Broadway are as if in different streets, and neither\\nexpect to recognize each other nor to pass from one to the other without\\nset effort. It took a good while to make Broad and Canal Streets\\nattractive business-streets, and to get the importers and jobbers out\\nof Pearl Street; but the work is now done. The Bowery affords the only\\nremaining chance of building a magnificent metropolitan thoroughfare in\\nNew York; and we anticipate the day--when Broadway will surrender its\\npretensions to that now modest Cheapside. Already, about the confluence\\nof the Third and Fourth Avenues at Eighth Street are congregated some\\nof the chief institutions of the city,--the Bible House, the Cooper\\nInstitute, the Astor Library, the Mercantile Library. Farther down,\\nthe continuation of Canal Street affords the most commanding sites for\\nfuture public edifices; while the neighborhoods of Franklin and Chatham\\nSquares ought to be seized upon to embellish the city at imperial points\\nwith its finest architectural piles. The capacities of New York, below\\nUnion Square, for metropolitan splendor are entirely undeveloped; the\\nbest points are still occupied by comparatively worthless buildings, and\\nthe future will produce a now unlooked-for change in the whole character\\nof that great district.\\n\\nThe huddling together of our American cities is due to the recentness\\nof the time when space was our greatest enemy and sparseness our chief\\ndiscouragement. Our founders hated room as much as a backwoods farmer\\nhates trees. The protecting walls, which narrowed the ways and cramped\\nthe houses of the Old-World cities, did not put a severer compress\\nupon them, than the disgust of solitude and the craving for \"the sweet\\nsecurity of streets\" threw about our city-builders. In the Western towns\\nnow, they carefully give a city air to their villages by crowding the\\nfew stores and houses of which they are composed into the likeliest\\nappearance of an absolute scarcity of space.\\n\\nThey labor unconsciously to look crowded, and would sooner go into a\\ncellar to eat their oysters than have them in the finest saloon above\\nground. And so, if a peninsula like Boston, or a miniature Mesopotamia\\nlike New York, or a basin like Cincinnati, could be found to tuck away\\na town in, in which there was a decent chance of covering over the\\nnakedness of the land within a thousand years, they rejoiced to seize\\non it and warm their shivering imaginations in the idea of the possible\\nsnugness which their distant posterity might enjoy.\\n\\nBoston owes its only park worth naming--the celebrated Common--to\\nthe necessity of leaving a convenient cow-pasture for the babes and\\nsucklings of that now mature community. Forty acres were certainly\\nnever more fortunately situated for their predestined service, nor more\\nprovidentially rescued for the higher uses of man. May the memory of the\\nweaning babes who pleaded for the spot where their \"milky mothers\" fed\\nbe ever sacred in our Athens, and may the cows of Boston be embalmed\\nwith the bulls of Egypt! A white heifer should be perpetually grazing,\\nat her tether, in the shadow of the Great Elm. Would it be wholly\\nunbecoming one born in full view of that lovely inclosure to suggest\\nthat the straightness of the lines in which the trees are planted on\\nBoston Common, and the rapidly increasing thickness of their foliage,\\ndestroy in the summer season the effect of breadth and liberty, hide\\nboth the immediate and the distant landscape, stifle the breeze, and\\ndiminish the attractiveness of the spot? Fewer trees, scattered in\\nclumps and paying little regard to paths, would vastly improve the\\neffect. The colonnades of the malls furnish all the shade desirable in\\nso small an inclosure.\\n\\nFor the most part, the proper laying-out of cities is both a matter of\\ngreater ease and greater importance in America than anywhere else. We\\nare much in the condition of those old Scriptural worthies, of whom it\\ncould be so coolly said, \"So he went and built a city,\" as if it were\\na matter of not much greater account than \"So be went and built a\\nlog-house.\" Very likely some of those Biblical cities, extemporized\\nso tersely, were not much more finished than those we now and then\\nencounter in our Western and Southern tours, where a poor shed at four\\ncross-roads is dignified with the title. We believe it was Samuel\\nDexter, the pattern of Webster, who, on hanging out his shingle in a\\nNew England village, where a tavern, a schoolhouse, a church, and a\\nblacksmith\\'s shop constituted the whole settlement, gave as a reason,\\nthat, having to break into the world somewhere, he had chosen the\\nweakest place. He would have tried a new Western city, had they then\\nbeen in fashion, as a still softer spot in the social crust. But this\\nrage for cities in America is prophetic. The name is a spell; and most\\nof the sites, surveyed and distributed into town-lots with squares and\\nparks staked out, are only a century before their time, and will redound\\nto the future credit, however fatal to the immediate cash of their\\nprojectors. Who can doubt that Cairo of Illinois--the standing joke of\\ntourists, (and the standing-water of the Ohio and Mississippi,) though\\nno joke to its founders--will one day rival its Egyptian prototype?\\nAmerica runs to cities, and particularly in its Northern latitudes.\\nAs cities have been the nurses of democratic institutions and ideas,\\ndemocratic nations, for very obvious reasons, tend to produce them. They\\nare the natural fruits of a democracy. And with no people are great\\ncities so important, or likely to be so increasingly populous, as with\\na great agricultural and commercial nation like our own, covered with\\na free and equal population. The vast wealth of such a people, evenly\\ndistributed, and prevented from over-accumulation in special families by\\nthe absence of primogeniture and entail,--their general education\\nand refined tastes,--the intense community of ideas, through the\\nall-pervading influence of a daily press reaching with simultaneous\\ndiffusion over thousands of square miles,--the facilities of\\nlocomotion,--all inevitably cooperate with commercial necessities to\\ncreate great cities,--not merely as the homes of the mercantile and\\nwealthy class, but as centres where the leisure, the tastes, the\\npride, and the wants of the people at large repair more and more for\\nsatisfaction. Free populations, educated in public schools and with an\\nopen career for all, soon instinctively settle the high economies of\\nlife.\\n\\nMany observers have ascribed the rapid change which for twenty years\\npast has been going on in the relative character of towns and villages\\non the one hand, and cities on the other, to the mere operation of the\\nrailroad-system. But that system itself grew out of higher instincts.\\nEqual communities demand equal privileges and advantages. They tend\\nto produce a common level. The country does not acquiesce in the\\nsuperiority of the city in manners, comforts, or luxuries. It demands\\na market at its door,--first-rate men for its advisers in all medical,\\nlegal, moral, and political matters. It demands for itself the\\namusements, the refinements, the privileges of the city. This is to\\nbe brought about only by the application, at any cost, of the most\\nimmediate methods of communication with the city; and behold our\\nrailroad system,--the Briarean shaking of hands which the country gives\\nthe city! The growth of this system is a curious commentary on the\\npurely mercenary policy which is ordinarily supposed to govern the\\ninvestments of capital. The railroads of the United States are as much\\nthe products of social rivalries and the fruits of an ineradicable\\ndemocratic instinct for popularizing all advantages, as of any\\ncommercial emulation. The people have willingly bandaged their own eyes,\\nand allowed themselves to believe a profitable investment was made,\\nbecause their inclinations were so determined to have the roads,\\nprofitable or not. Their wives and daughters _would_ shop in the city;\\nthe choicest sights and sounds were there; there concentrated themselves\\nthe intellectual and moral lights; there were the representative\\nsplendors of the state or nation;--and a swift access to them was\\nessential to true equality and self-respect.\\n\\nOne does not need to be a graybeard to recall the time when every\\ncounty-town in New England had, because it needs must have, its\\nfirst rate lawyer, its distinguished surgeon, its comprehensive\\nbusiness-man,--and when a fixed and unchanging population gave to our\\nvillages a more solid and a more elegant air than they now possess. The\\nConnecticut river-villages, with a considerable increase in population,\\nand a vast improvement in the general character of the dwellings, have\\nnevertheless lost their most characterizing features,--the large and\\ndignified residences of their founders, and the presence of the once\\nable and widely known men that were identified with their local\\nimportance and pride. The railroads have concentrated the ability of all\\nthe professions in the cities, and carried thither the wealth of all the\\nold families. To them, and not to the county-town, repair the people for\\nadvice in all critical matters, for supplies in all important purchases,\\nfor all their rarest pleasures, and all their most prized and memorable\\nopportunities.\\n\\nCities, and the immediate neighborhood of cities, are rapidly becoming\\nthe chosen residences of the enterprising, successful, and intelligent.\\nAs might be supposed, the movement works both ways: the locomotive\\nfacilities carry citizens into the country, as well as countrymen into\\nthe city. But those who have once tasted the city are never wholly\\nweaned from it, and every citizen who moves into a village-community\\nsends two countrymen back to take his place. He infects the country with\\ncivic tastes, and acts as a great conductor between the town and the\\ncountry. It is apparent, too, that the experience of ten years, during\\nwhich some strong reaction upon the centripetal tendencies of the\\nprevious ten years drove many of the wealthy and the self-supposed\\nlovers of quietude and space into the country, has dispersed several\\nvery natural prejudices, and returned the larger part of the truants\\nto their original ways. One of these prejudices was, that our ordinary\\nNorthern climate was as favorable to the outdoor habits of the leisurely\\nclass as the English climate; whereas, besides not having a leisurely\\nclass, and never being destined to have any, under our wise\\nwealth-distributing customs, and not having any out-door habits, which\\ngrow up only on estates and on hereditary fortunes, experience has\\nconvinced most who have tried it that we have only six months when\\nout-of-doors allows any comfort, health, or pleasure away from the city.\\nThe roads are sloughs; side-walks are wanting; shelter is gone with the\\nleaves; non-intercourse is proclaimed; companionship cannot be found;\\nleisure is a drug; books grow stupid; the country is a stupendous bore.\\nAnother prejudice was the anticipated economy of the country. This has\\nturned out to be, as might have been expected, an economy to those who\\nfall in with its ways, which citizens are wholly inapt and unprepared to\\ndo. It is very economical not to want city comforts and conveniences.\\nBut it proves more expensive to those who go into the country to want\\nthem there than it did to have them where they abound. They are not to\\nbe had in the country at any price,--water, gas, fuel, food, attendance,\\namusement, locomotion in all weathers; but such a moderate measure of\\nthem as a city-bred family cannot live without involves so great an\\nexpense, that the expected economy of life in the country to those not\\nactually brought up there turns out a delusion. The expensiveness of\\nlife in the city comes of the generous and grand scale on which it there\\nproceeds, not from the superior cost of the necessaries or comforts of\\nlife. They are undoubtedly cheaper in the city, all things considered,\\nthan anywhere in the country. Where everything is to be had, in the\\nsmallest or the largest quantities,--where every form of service can be\\ncommanded at a moment\\'s notice,--where the wit, skill, competition of a\\ncountry are concentrated upon the furnishing of all commodities at the\\nmost taking rates,--there prices will, of course, be most reasonable;\\nand the expensiveness of such communities, we repeat, is entirely due to\\nthe abundant wealth which makes such enormous demands and secures such\\nvarious comforts and luxuries;--in short, it is the high standard of\\nliving, not the cost of the necessaries of life. This high standard\\nis, of course, an evil to those whose social ambition drives them to a\\nrivalry for which they are not prepared. But no special pity is due to\\nhardships self-imposed by pride and folly. The probability is, that,\\nproportioned to their income from labor, the cost of living in the city,\\nfor the bulk of its population, is lighter, their degree of comfort\\nconsidered, than in the country. And for the wealthy class of society,\\nno doubt, on the whole, economy is served by living in the city. Our\\nmost expensive class is that which lives in the country after the manner\\nof the city.\\n\\nA literary man, of talents and thorough respectability, lately informed\\nus, that, after trying all places, cities, villages, farmhouses,\\nboarding-houses, hotels, taverns, he had discovered that keeping house\\nin New York was the cheapest way to live,--vastly the cheapest, if\\nthe amount of convenience and comfort was considered,--and absolutely\\ncheapest in fact. To be sure, being a bachelor, his housekeeping was\\ndone in a single room, the back-room of a third-story, in a respectable\\nand convenient house and neighborhood. His rent was ninety-six dollars a\\nyear. His expenses of every other kind, (clothing excepted,) one dollar\\na week. He could not get his chop or steak cooked well enough, nor his\\ncoffee made right, until he took them in hand himself,--nor his bed\\nmade, nor his room cleaned. His conveniences were incredibly great. He\\ncooked by alcohol, and expected to warm himself the winter through on\\ntwo gallons of alcohol at seventy-five cents a gallon. This admirable\\nhousekeeping is equalled in economy only by that of a millionnaire, a\\nNew-Yorker, and a bachelor also, whose accounts, all accurately kept by\\nhis own hand, showed, after death, that (1st) his own living, (2d) his\\nsupport of religion, (3d) his charities, (4th) his gifts to a favorite\\nniece, had not averaged, for twenty years, over five hundred dollars.\\nTruly, the city is a cheap place to live in, for those who know how! And\\nwhat place is cheap for those who do not?\\n\\nContrary to the old notion, the more accurate statistics of recent times\\nhave proved the city, as compared with the country, the more healthy,\\nthe more moral, and the more religious place. What used to be considered\\nthe great superiority of the country--hardship, absence of social\\nexcitements and public amusements, simple food, freedom from moral\\nexposure--a better knowledge of the human constitution, considered\\neither physically or morally, has shown to be decidedly opposed to\\nhealth and virtue. More constitutions are broken down in the hardening\\nprocess than survive and profit by it. Cold houses, coarse food\\nunskilfully cooked, long winters, harsh springs, however favorable to\\nthe heroism of the stomach, the lungs, and the spirits, are not found\\nconducive to longevity. In like manner, monotony, seclusion, lack of\\nvariety and of social stimulus lower the tone of humanity, drive to\\nsensual pleasures and secret vices, and nourish a miserable pack of\\nmean and degrading immoralities, of which scandal, gossip, backbiting,\\ntale-bearing are the better examples.\\n\\nIn the Old World, the wealth of states is freely expended in the\\nembellishment of their capitals. It is well understood, not only that\\nloyalty is never more economically secured than by a lavish appeal to\\nthe pride of the citizen in the magnificence of the public buildings\\nand grounds which he identifies with his nationality, but that popular\\nrestlessness is exhaled and dangerous passions drained off in the\\nroominess which parks and gardens afford the common people. In the\\nNew World, it has not yet proved necessary to provide against popular\\ndiscontents or to bribe popular patriotism with spectacles and\\nstate-parade; and if it were so, there is no government with an interest\\nof its own separate from that of the people to adopt this policy. It has\\ntherefore been concluded that democratic institutions must necessarily\\nlack splendor and great public provision for the gratification of the\\naesthetic tastes or the indulgence of the leisure of the common people.\\nThe people being, then, our sovereigns, it has not been felt that they\\nwould or could have the largeness of view, the foresight, the sympathy\\nwith leisure, elegance, and ease, to provide liberally and expensively\\nfor their own recreation and refreshment. A bald utility has been the\\nanticipated genius of our public policy. Our national Mercury was to be\\nsimply the god of the post-office, or the sprite of the barometer,--our\\nPan, to keep the crows from the corn-fields,--our Muses, to preside over\\ndistrict-schools. It begins now to appear that the people are not likely\\nto think anything too good for themselves, or to higgle about the\\nexpense of whatever ministers largely to their tastes and fancies,--that\\npolitical freedom, popular education, the circulation of newspapers,\\nbooks, engravings, pictures, have already created a public which\\nunderstands that man does not live by bread alone,--which demands\\nleisure, beauty, space, architecture, landscape, music, elegance, with\\nan imperative voice, and is ready to back its demands with the necessary\\nself-taxation. This experience our absolute faith in free institutions\\nenabled us to anticipate as the inevitable result of our political\\nsystem; but let us confess that the rapidity with which it has developed\\nitself has taken us by surprise. We knew, that, when the people truly\\nrealized their sovereignty, they would claim not only the utilitarian,\\nbut the artistic and munificent attributes of their throne,--and that\\nall the splendors and decorations, all the provisions for leisure,\\ntaste, and recreation, which kings and courts have made, would be found\\nto be mere preludes and rehearsals to the grander arrangements and\\nachievements of the vastly richer and more legitimate sovereign, the\\nPeople, when he understood his own right and duty. As dynasties and\\nthrones have been predictions of the royalty of the people, so old\\ncourts and old capitals, with all their pomp and circumstance, their\\nparks and gardens, galleries and statues, are but dim prefigurings of\\nthe glories of architecture, the grandeur of the grounds, the splendor\\nand richness of the museums and conservatories with which the people\\nwill finally crown their own self-respect and decorate their own\\nmajesty. But we did not expect to see this sure prophecy turning itself\\ninto history in our day. We thought the people were too busy with the\\nspade and the quill to care for any other sceptres at present. But it\\nis now plain that they have been dreaming princely dreams and thinking\\nroyal thoughts all the while, and are now ready to put them into costly\\nexpression.\\n\\nPassing by all other evidences of this, we come at once to the most\\nmajestic and indisputable witness of this fact, the actual existence\\nof the Central Park in New York,--the most striking evidence of\\nthe sovereignty of the people yet afforded in the history of free\\ninstitutions,--the best answer yet given to the doubts and fears which\\nhave frowned on the theory of self-government,--the first grand proof\\nthat the people do not mean to give up the advantages and victories of\\naristocratic governments, in maintaining a popular one, but to engraft\\nthe energy, foresight, and liberality of concentrated powers upon\\ndemocratic ideas, and keep all that has adorned and improved the past,\\nwhile abandoning what has impaired and disgraced it. That the American\\npeople appreciate and are ready to support what is most elegant,\\nrefined, and beautiful in the greatest capitals of Europe,--that they\\nvalue and intend to provide the largest and most costly opportunities\\nfor the enjoyment of their own leisure, artistic tastes, and rural\\ninstincts, is emphatically declared in the history, progress, and\\nmanifest destiny of the Central Park; while their competency to use\\nwisely, to enjoy peacefully, to protect sacredly, and to improve\\nindustriously the expensive, exposed, and elegant pleasure-ground they\\nhave devised, is proved with redundant testimony by the year and more of\\nexperience we have had in the use of the Park, under circumstances far\\nless favorable than any that can ever again arise. As a test of the\\nability of the people to know their own higher wants, of the power of\\ntheir artistic instincts, their docility to the counsels of their most\\njudicious representatives, their superiority to petty economies, their\\nstrength to resist the natural opposition of heavy tax-payers to\\nexpensive public works, their gentleness and amenableness to just\\nauthority in the pursuit of their pleasures, of their susceptibility to\\nthe softening influences of elegance and beauty, of their honest pride\\nand rejoicing in their own splendor, of their superior fondness for what\\nis innocent and elevating over what is base and degrading, when\\nbrought within equal reach, the Central Park has already afforded most\\nencouraging, nay, most decisive proof.\\n\\nThe Central Park is an anomaly to those who have not deeply studied the\\ntendencies of popular governments. It is a royal work, undertaken and\\nachieved by the Democracy,--surprising equally themselves and their\\nskeptical friends at home and abroad,--and developing, both in its\\ncreation and growth, in its use and application, new and almost\\nincredible tastes, aptitudes, capacities, and powers in the people\\nthemselves. That the people should be capable of the magnanimity of\\nlaying down their authority, when necessary to concentrate it in\\nthe hands of energetic and responsible trustees requiring large\\npowers,--that they should be willing to tax themselves heavily for the\\nbenefit of future generations,--that they should be wise enough to\\ndistrust their own judgment and defer modestly to the counsels of\\nexperts,--that they should be in favor of the most solid and substantial\\nwork,--that they should be willing to have the better half of their\\nmoney under ground and out of sight, invested in drains and foundations\\nof roads,--that they should acquiesce cheerfully in all the restrictions\\nnecessary to the achievement of the work, while admitted freely to the\\nuse and enjoyment of its inchoate processes,--that their conduct and\\nmanners should prove so unexceptionable,--their disposition to trespass\\nupon strict rules so small,--their use and improvement of the work so\\nfree, so easy, and so immediately justificatory of all the cost of so\\ngenerous and grand an enterprise: these things throw light and cheer\\nupon the prospects of popular institutions, at a period when they are\\nseriously clouded from other quarters.\\n\\nWe do not propose to enter into any description of the Central Park.\\nThose who have not already visited it will find a description,\\naccompanying a study for the plan submitted for competition in 1858, by\\nMessrs. Olmsted and Vaux, and published among the Documents of the New\\nYork Senate, which will satisfy their utmost expectations. We wish\\nmerely to throw out some replies to the leading objections we have met\\nin the papers and other quarters to the plan itself. We need hardly say\\nthat the Central Park requires no advocate and no defence. Its great\\nproprietor, the Public, is perfectly satisfied with his purchase and his\\nagents. He thinks himself providentially guided in the choice of his\\nSuperintendent, and does not vainly pique himself upon his sagacity in\\nselecting Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted for the post. This gentleman, in his\\nplace, offsets at least a thousand square plugs in round holes. He is\\nprecisely the man for the place,--and that is precisely the place for\\nthe man. Among final causes, it would be difficult not to assign the\\nCentral Park as the reason of his existence. To fill the duties of his\\noffice as he has filled them,--to prove himself equally competent as\\noriginal designer, patient executor, potent disciplinarian, and model\\npolice-officer,--to enforce a method, precision, and strictness, equally\\nmarked in the workmanship, in the accounts, and in the police of the\\nPark,--to be equally studious of the highest possible use and enjoyment\\nof the work by the public of to-day, and of the prospects and privileges\\nof the coming generations,--to sympathize with the outside people,\\nwhile in the closest fellowship with the inside,--to make himself\\nequally the favorite and friend of the people and of the workmen:\\nthis proves an original adaptation, most carefully improved, which we\\nseriously believe not capable of being paralleled in any other public\\nwork, of similar magnitude, ever undertaken. The union of prosaic\\nsense with poetical feeling, of democratic sympathies with refined\\nand scholarly tastes, of punctilious respect for facts with tender\\nhospitality for ideas, has enabled him to appreciate and embody, both in\\nthe conception and execution of the Park, the beau-ideal of a people\\'s\\npleasure-ground. If he had not borne, as an agriculturist, and as the\\nkeenest, most candid, and instructive of all our writers on the moral\\nand political economy of our American Slavery, a name to be long\\nremembered, he might safely trust his reputation to the keeping of New\\nYork city and all her successive citizens, as the author and achiever of\\nthe Central Park,--which, when completed, will prove, we are confident,\\nthe most splendid, satisfactory, and popular park in the world.\\n\\nTwo grand assumptions have controlled the design from the inception.\\n\\nFirst, That the Park would be the only park deserving the name, for a\\ntown of twice or thrice the present population of New York; that\\nthis town would be built compactly around it (and in this respect\\nof centrality it would differ from any extant metropolitan park of\\nmagnitude); and that it would be a town of greater wealth and more\\nluxurious demands than any now existing.\\n\\nSecond, That, while in harmony with the luxury of the rich, the Park\\nshould and would be used more than any existing park by people of\\nmoderate wealth and by poor people, and that its use by these people\\nmust be made safe, convenient, agreeable; that they must be expected\\nto have a pride and pleasure in using it rightly, in cherishing and\\nprotecting it against all causes of injury and dilapidation, and that\\nthis is to be provided for and encouraged.\\n\\nA want of appreciation of the first assumption is the cause of all\\nsincere criticism against the Transverse Roads. Some engineers\\noriginally pronounced them impracticable of construction; but all their\\ngrounds of apprehension have been removed by the construction of two of\\nthem, especially by the completion of the tunnel under Vista Rock, and\\nbelow the foundation of the Reservoir embankment and wall. They were\\nplanned for the future; they are being built solidly, massively,\\npermanently, for the future. Less thoroughly and expensively\\nconstructed, they would need to be rebuilt in the future at enormously\\nincreased cost, and with great interruption to the use of the Park; and\\nthe grounds in their vicinity, losing the advantage of age, would need\\nto be remodelled and remade. An engineer, visiting the Park for the\\nfirst time, and hearing the criticism to which we refer applied to the\\nwalls and bridges of the Transverse Roads, observed,--\"People in this\\ncountry are so unaccustomed to see genuine substantial work, they do not\\nknow what it means when they meet with it.\" We think he did not do the\\npeople justice.\\n\\nThe Transverse Roads passing through the Park will not be seen from\\nit; and although they will not be, when deep in the shadow of the\\noverhanging bridges and groves, without a very grand beauty, this will\\nbe the beauty of utility and of permanence, not of imaginative grace.\\nThe various bridges and archways of the Park proper, while equally\\nthorough in their mode of construction, and consequently expensive,\\nare in all cases embellished each with special decorations in form and\\ncolor. These decorations have the same quality of substantiality and\\nthorough good workmanship. Note the clean under-cutting of the leaves,\\n(of which there are more than fifty different forms in the decorations\\nof the Terrace arch,) and their consequent sharp and expressive shadows.\\nAdmitting the need of these structures, and the economy of a method of\\nconstruction which would render them permanent, the additional cost of\\ntheir permanent decoration in this way could not have been rationally\\ngrudged.\\n\\nRegard for the distant future has likewise controlled the planting; and\\nthe Commissioners, in so far as they have resisted the clamor of the\\nday, that the Park must be immediately shaded, have done wisely. Every\\nhorticulturist knows that this immediate shade would be purchased at an\\nexpense of dwarfed, diseased, and deformed trees, with stinted shade, in\\nthe future. No man has planted large and small trees together without\\nregretting the former within twenty years. The same consideration\\nanswers an objection which has been made, that the trees are too much\\narranged in masses of color. Imagine a growth of twenty years, with the\\nproper thinnings, and most of these masses will resolve each into one\\ntree, singled out, as the best individual of its mass, to remain. There\\nis a large scale in the planting, as in everything else.\\n\\nRegard to the convenience, comfort, and safety of those who cannot\\nafford to visit the Park in carriages has led to an unusual extent and\\nvariety of character in the walks, and also to a peculiar arrangement by\\nwhich they are carried in many instances beneath and across the line of\\nthe carriage-roads. Thus access can be had by pedestrians to all parts\\nof the Park at times when the roads are thronged with vehicles, without\\nany delays or dangers in crossing the roads, and without the humiliation\\nto sensitive democrats of being spattered or dusted, or looked down upon\\nfrom luxurious equipages.\\n\\nThe great irregularity of the surface offers facilities for this\\npurpose,--the walks being carried through the heads of valleys which are\\ncrossed by the carriage-ways upon arches of masonry. Now with regard to\\nthese archways, if no purposes of convenience were to be served by them,\\nthe Park would not, we may admit, be beautified by them. But we assume\\nthat the population of New York is to be doubled; that, when it is so,\\nif not sooner, the walks and drives of the Park will often be densely\\nthronged; and, for the comfort of the people, when that shall be the\\ncase, we consider that these archways will be absolutely necessary.[A]\\nAssuming further, then, that they are to be built, and, if ever, built\\nnow,--since it would involve an entirely new-modelling of the Park to\\nintroduce them in the future,--it was necessary to pay some attention to\\nmake them agreeable and unmonotonous objects, or the general impression\\nof ease, freedom, and variety would be interfered with very materially.\\nIt is not to make the Park architectural, as is commonly supposed, that\\nvarious and somewhat expensive _design_ is introduced; on the contrary,\\nit is the intention to plant closely in the vicinity of all the arches,\\nso that they may be unnoticed in the general effect, and be seen only\\njust at the time they are being used, when, of course, they must come\\nunder notice. The charge is made, that the features of the natural\\nlandscape have been disregarded in the plan. To which we answer, that on\\nthe ground of the Lower Park there was originally no landscape, in the\\nartistic sense. There were hills, and hillocks, and rocks, and swampy\\nvalleys. It would have been easy to flood the swamps into ponds, to\\nclothe the hillocks with grass and the hills with foliage, and leave the\\nrocks each unscathed in its picturesqueness. And this would have been a\\ngreat improvement; yet there would be no landscape: there would be\\nan unassociated succession of objects,--many nice \"bits\" of scenery,\\nappropriate to a villa-garden or to an artist\\'s sketch-book, but no\\nscenery such as an artist arranges for his broad canvas, no composition,\\nno _park-like_ prospect. It would have afforded a good place for\\nloitering; but if this were all that was desirable, forty acres would\\nhave done as well as a thousand, as is shown in the Ramble. Space,\\nbreadth, objects in the distance, clear in outline, but obscure,\\nmysterious, exciting curiosity, in their detail, were wanting.\\n\\n[Footnote A: The length of roads, walks, etc., completed, will be found\\nin the last Annual Report, pp. 47-52.\\n\\nThe length of the famous drive in Hyde Park (the King Road) is 2 1/2\\nmiles. There is another road, straight between two gates, 1 1/4 miles in\\nlength. \"Rotten Bow\" (the Ride) is a trifle over a mile in length.\\n\\nThe length of Drive in Central Park will be 9 1/3 miles; the length of\\nBridle Roads, 5 1/3 miles; the length of Walks, 20 miles.\\n\\nTen miles of walk, gravelled and substantially underlaid, are now\\nfinished.\\n\\nEighteen archways are planned, beside those of the Transverse Roads,\\nequal 1 to 46 acres. When the planting is well-grown, no two of the\\narchways will be visible from the same point.]\\n\\nTo their supply there were hard limitations. On each side, within half\\na mile of each other, there were to be lines of stone and brick houses,\\ncutting off any great lateral distance. Suppose one to have entered\\nthe Park at the south end, and to have moved far enough within it to\\ndispossess his mind of the sentiments of the streets: he will have\\nthreaded his way between hillocks and rocks, one after another,\\ndiffering in magnitude, but never opening a landscape having breadth or\\ndistance. He ascends a hill and looks northward: the most distant\\nobject is the hard, straight, horizontal line of the stone wall of the\\nReservoir, flanked on one side by the peak of Vista Rock. It is a little\\nover a mile distant,--but, standing clear out against the horizon,\\nappears much less than that. Hide it with foliage, as well as the houses\\nright and left, and the limitation of distance is a mile in front and a\\nquarter of a mile upon each side. Low hills or ridges of rock in a great\\ndegree cut off the intermediate ground from view: cross these, and the\\nsame unassociated succession of objects might be visited, but no one of\\nthem would have engaged the visitor\\'s attention and attracted him onward\\nfrom a distance. The plan has evidently been to make a selection of\\nthe natural features to form the leading ideas of the new scenery, to\\nmagnify the most important quality of each of these, and to remove or\\ntone down all the irregularities of the ground between them, and by all\\nmeans to make the limit of vision undefined and obscure. Thus, in the\\ncentral portion of the Lower Park the low grounds have been generally\\nfilled, and the high grounds reduced; but the two largest areas of low\\nground have been excavated, the excavation being carried laterally into\\nthe hills as far as was possible, without extravagant removal of rock,\\nand the earth obtained transferred to higher ground connecting hillocks\\nwith hills. Excavations have also been made about the base of all the\\nmore remarkable ledges and peaks of rock, while additional material has\\nbeen conveyed to their sides and summits to increase their size and\\ndignity.\\n\\nThis general rule of the plan was calculated to give, in the first\\nplace, breadth, and, in the second, emphasis, to any general prospect\\nof the Park. A want of unity, or rather, if we may use the word, of\\nassemblage, belonged to the ground; and it must have been one of the\\nfirst problems to establish some one conspicuous, salient idea which\\nshould take the lead in the composition, and about which all minor\\nfeatures should seem naturally to group as accessories. The straight,\\nevidently artificial, and hence distinctive and notable, Mall, with its\\nterminating Terrace, was the resolution of this problem. It will be,\\nwhen the trees are fully grown, a feature of the requisite importance,\\n--and will serve the further purpose of opening the view toward, and, as\\nit were, framing and keeping attention directed upon, Vista Rock, which\\nfrom the southern end of the Mall is the most distant object that can be\\nbrought into view.\\n\\nFor the same purpose, evidently, it was thought desirable to insist,\\nas far as possible, upon a pause at the point where, to the visitor\\nproceeding northward, the whole hill-side and glen before Vista Rock\\nfirst came under view, and where an effect of distance in that direction\\nwas yet attainable. This is provided for by the Terrace, with its\\nseveral stairs and stages, and temptations to linger and rest. The\\nintroduction of the Lake to the northward of the Terrace also obliges a\\ndiversion from the direct line of proceeding; the visitor\\'s attention is\\nhenceforth directed laterally, or held by local objects, until at length\\nby a circuitous route he reaches and ascends (if he chooses) the summit\\nof Vista Rock, when a new landscape of entirely different character, and\\none not within our control, is opened to him. Thus the apparent distance\\nof Vista Rock from the lower part of the Park (which is increased\\nby means which we have not thought it necessary to describe) is not\\nfalsified by any experience of the visitor in his subsequent journey to\\nit.\\n\\nThere was a fine and completely natural landscape in the Upper Park. The\\nplan only simplifies it,--removing and modifying those objects which\\nwere incongruous with its best predominating character, and here and\\nthere adding emphasis or shadow.\\n\\nThe Park (with the extension) is two and three quarter miles in length\\nand nearly half a mile wide. It contains 843 acres, including the\\nReservoir (136 acres).\\n\\n  Original cost of land to 106th Street,             $5,444,369.90\\n  Of this, assessed on adjoining property,            1,657,590.00\\n                                                      ____________\\n  To be paid by corporation direct,                   3,786,779.90\\n  Assessed value of extension land, (106th to 110th,) 1,400,000.00\\n                                                      ____________\\n  Total cost of land,                                $6,800,000.00[B]\\n\\n[Footnote B: The amount thus far expended in construction and\\nmaintenance is nearly $3,000,000. The plan upon which the work is\\nproceeding will require a further expenditure of $1,600,000. The\\nexpenditure is not squandered. Much the larger part of it is paid for\\nday-labor. Account with laborers is kept by the hour, the rate of wages\\nbeing scarcely above the lowest contractor\\'s rates, and 30 per cent.\\nbelow the rate of other public works of the city; always paid directly\\ninto the laborer\\'s hands,--in specie, however.\\n\\nThe thorough government of the work, and the general efficiency of its\\ndirection, are indicated by the remarkable good order and absence of\\n\"accidents\" which have characterized it. See p. 64 of Annual Report,\\n1860. For some particulars of cost, see pp. 61, 62, of same Report.]\\n\\nIn all European parks, there is more or less land the only use of which\\nis to give a greater length to the roads which pass around it,--it being\\nout of sight, and, in American phrase, unimproved. There is not an acre\\nof land in Central Park, which, if not wanted for Park purposes, would\\nnot sell for at least as much as the land surrounding the Park and\\nbeyond its limits,--that is to say, for at least $60,000, the legal\\nannual interest of which is $4,200. This would be the ratio of the\\nannual waste of property in the case of any land not put to use; but,\\nin elaborating the plan, care has been taken that no part of the Park\\nshould be without its special advantages, attractions, or valuable uses,\\nand that these should as far as possible be made immediately available\\nto the public.\\n\\nThe comprehensiveness of purpose and the variety of detail of the plan\\nfar exceed those of any other park in the world, and have involved, and\\ncontinue to involve, a greater amount of study and invention than has\\never before been given to a park. A consideration of this should enforce\\nan unusually careful method of maintenance, both in the gardening and\\npolice departments. Sweeping with a broom of brush-wood once a week is\\nwell enough for a hovel; but the floors of a palace must needs be daily\\nwaxed and polished, to justify their original cost. We are unused to\\nthorough gardening in this country. There are not in all the United\\nStates a dozen lawns or grass-plots so well kept as the majority of\\ntradesmen\\'s door-yards in England or Holland. Few of our citizens have\\never seen a really well-kept ground. During the last summer, much of the\\nPark was in a state of which the Superintendent professed himself to be\\nashamed; but it caused not the slightest comment with the public, so far\\nas we heard. As nearly all men in office, who have not a personal taste\\nto satisfy, are well content, if they succeed in satisfying the public,\\nwe fear the Superintendent will be forced to \"economize\" on the keeping\\nof the Park, as he was the past year, to a degree which will be as far\\nfrom true economy as the cleaning of mosaic floors with birch brooms.\\nThe Park is laid out in a manner which assumes and requires cleanly and\\norderly habits in those who use it; much of its good quality will be\\nlost, if it be not very neatly kept; and such negligence in the keeping\\nwill tend to negligence in the using.\\n\\nIn the plan, there is taken for granted a generally good inclination, a\\ncleanly, temperate, orderly disposition, on the part of the public which\\nis to frequent the Park, and finally to be the governors of its keeping,\\nand a good, well-disposed, and well-disciplined police force, who would,\\nin spite of \"the inabilities of a republic,\" adequately control the\\ncases exceptional to the assumed general good habits of that public,--at\\nthe same time neglecting no precaution to facilitate the convenient\\nenforcement of the laws, and reduce the temptation to disorderly\\npractices to a minimum.\\n\\nHow thoroughly justified has been this confidence in the people, taking\\ninto account the novelty of a good public ground, of cleanliness in our\\npublic places, and indeed the novelty of the whole undertaking, we have\\nalready intimated. How much the privileges of the Park in its present\\nincomplete condition are appreciated, and how generally the requirements\\nof order are satisfied, the following summary, compiled from the\\nPark-keeper\\'s reports of the first summer\\'s use after the roads of the\\nLower Park were opened, will inadequately show.\\n\\n  Number of visitors in six months.

Of these, twenty-four were sufficiently drunk to justify\\ntheir arrest,--the remainder going quietly off the grounds, when\\nrequested to do so. That is to say, it is not oftener than once a week\\nthat a man is observed to be the worse for liquor while on the Park; and\\nthis, while three to four thousand laboring men are at work within it,\\nare paid upon it, and grog-shops for their accommodation are all along\\nits boundaries. In other words, about one in thirty thousand of the\\nvisitors to the Park has been under the influence of drink when induced\\nto visit it.\\n\\nOn Christmas and New-Year\\'s Days, it was estimated by many experienced\\nreporters that over 100,000 persons, each day, were on the Park,\\ngenerally in a frolicksome mood. Of these, but one (a small boy) was\\nobserved by the keepers to be drunk; there was not an instance of\\nquarrelling, and no disorderly conduct, except a generally good-natured\\nresistance to the efforts of the police to maintain safety on the ice.\\n\\nThe Bloomingdale Road and Harlem Lane, two famous trotting-courses,\\nwhere several hundred famously fast horses may be seen at the top of\\ntheir speed any fine afternoon, both touch an entrance to the Park. The\\nPark roads are, of course, vastly attractive to the trotters, and for\\na few weeks there were daily instances of fast driving there: as soon,\\nhowever, as the law and custom of the Park, restricting speed to a\\nmoderate rate, could be made generally understood, fast driving became\\nvery rare,--more so, probably, than in Hyde Park or the Bois de\\nBoulogne. As far as possible, an arrest has been made in every case\\nof intentionally fast driving observed by the keepers: those arrested\\nnumber less than one to ten thousand of the vehicles entering the Park\\nfor pleasure-driving. In each case a fine (usually three dollars) has\\nbeen imposed by the magistrate.\\n\\nIn six months there have been sixty-four arrests for all sorts of\\n\"disorderly conduct,\" including walking on the grass after being\\nrequested to quit it, quarrelling, firing crackers, etc.,--one in\\neighteen thousand visitors. So thoroughly established is the good\\nconduct of people on the Park, that many ladies walk daily in the Ramble\\nwithout attendance.\\n\\nA protest, as already intimated, is occasionally made against the\\ncompleteness of detail to which the Commissioners are disposed to\\ncarry their work, on the ground that the habits of the masses of our\\ncity-population are ill-calculated for its appreciation, and that loss\\nand damage to expensive work must often be the result. To which we\\nwould answer, that, if the authorities of the city hitherto have so far\\nmisapprehended or neglected their duty as to allow a large industrious\\npopulation to continue so long without the opportunity for public\\nrecreations that it has grown up ignorant of the rights and duties\\nappertaining to the general use of a well-kept pleasure-ground, any\\nlosses of the kind apprehended, which may in consequence occur, should\\nbe cheerfully borne as a necessary part of the responsibility of a\\ngood government. Experience thus far, however, does not justify these\\napprehensions.\\n\\nTo collect exact evidence showing that the Park is already exercising a\\ngood influence upon the character of the people is not in the nature of\\nthe case practicable. It has been observed that rude, noisy fellows,\\nafter entering the more advanced or finished parts of the Park, become\\nhushed, moderate, and careful. Observing the generally tranquil and\\npleased expression, and the quiet, sauntering movement, the frequent\\nexclamations of pleasure in the general view or in the sight of some\\nspecial object of natural beauty, on the part of the crowds of idlers in\\nthe Ramble on a Sunday afternoon, and recollecting the totally opposite\\ncharacter of feeling, thought, purpose, and sentiment which is expressed\\nby a crowd assembled anywhere else, especially in the public streets of\\nthe city, the conviction cannot well be avoided that the Park already\\nexercises a beneficent influence of no inconsiderable value, and of a\\nkind which could have been gained in no other way. We speak of Sunday\\nafternoons and of a crowd; but the Park evidently does induce many a\\npoor family, and many a poor seamstress and journeyman, to take a day or\\na half-day from the working-time of the week, to the end of retaining\\ntheir youth and their youthful relations with purer Nature, and to their\\ngain in strength, good-humor, safe citizenship, and--if the economists\\nmust be satisfied--money-value to the commonwealth. Already, too, there\\nare several thousand men, women, and children who resort to the Park\\nhabitually: some daily, before business or after business, and women\\nand children at regular hours during the day; some weekly; and some at\\nirregular, but certain frequent chances of their business. Mr. Astor,\\nwhen in town, rarely misses his daily ride; nor Mr. Bancroft; Mr. Mayor\\nHarper never his drive. And there are certain working-men with their\\nfamilies equally sure to be met walking on Sunday morning or Sunday\\nafternoon; others on Saturday. The number of these _habitues_ constantly\\nincreases. When we meet those who depend on the Park as on the butcher\\nand the omnibus, and the thousands who are again drawn by whatever\\nimpulse and suggestion of the hour, we often ask, What would they have\\ndone, where would they have been, to what sort of recreation would they\\nhave turned, _if to any_, had there been no park? Of one sort the answer\\nis supplied by the keeper of a certain saloon, who came to the Park, as\\nhe said, to see his old Sunday customers. The enjoyment of the ice had\\nmade them forget their grog.\\n\\nSix or seven years ago, an opposition brought down the prices and\\nquadrupled the accommodations of the Staten Island ferry-boats. Clifton\\nPark and numerous German gardens were opened; and the consequence was\\ndescribed, in common phrase, as the transformation of a portion of the\\nisland, on Sunday, to a Pandemonium. We thought we would, like Dante,\\nhave a cool look at it. We had read so much about it, and heard it\\ntalked about and preached about so much, that we were greatly surprised\\nto find the throng upon the sidewalks quite as orderly and a great deal\\nmore evidently good-natured than any we ever saw before in the United\\nStates. We spent some time in what we had been led to suppose the\\nhottest place, Clifton Park, in which there was a band of music and\\nseveral thousand persons, chiefly Germans, though with a good sprinkling\\nof Irish servant-girls with their lovers and brothers, with beer\\nand ices; but we saw no rudeness, and no more impropriety, no more\\nexcitement, no more (week-day) sin, than we had seen at the church in\\nthe morning. Every face, however, was foreign. By-and-by came in three\\nAmericans, talking loudly, moving rudely, proclaiming contempt for\\n\"lager\" and yelling for \"liquor,\" bantering and offering fight, joking\\ncoarsely, profane, noisy, demonstrative in any and every way, to the end\\nof attracting attention to themselves, and proclaiming that they were\\n\"on a spree\" and highly excited. They could not keep it up; they became\\nawkward, ill at ease, and at length silent, standing looking about them\\nin stupid wonder. Evidently they could not understand what it meant:\\npeople drinking, smoking in public, on Sunday, and yet not excited, not\\ntrying to make it a spree. It was not comprehensible. We ascertained\\nthat one of the ferry-boat bars had disposed of an enormous stock of\\nlemonade, ginger-beer, and soda-water before three o\\'clock,--but, till\\nthis was all gone, not half a dozen glasses of intoxicating drinks.\\nWe saw no quarrelling, no drunkenness, and nothing like the fearful\\ndisorder which had been described,--with a few such exceptions as we\\nhave mentioned of native Americans who had no conception of enjoyment\\nfree from bodily excitement.\\n\\nTo teach and induce habits of orderly, tranquil, contemplative, or\\nsocial amusement, moderate exercises and recreation, soothing to the\\nnerves, has been the most needed \"mission\" for New York. We think we\\nsee daily evidence that the Park accomplishes not a little in this way.\\nUnfortunately, the evidence is not of a character to be expressed in\\nFederal currency, else the Commissioners would not be hesitating about\\ntaking the ground from One-Hundred-and-Sixth to One-Hundred-and-Tenth\\nStreet, because it is to cost half a million more than was anticipated.\\nWhat the Park is worth to us to-day is, we trust, but a trifle to what\\nit will be worth when the bulk of our hard-working people, of our\\nover-anxious Marthas, and our gutter-skating children shall live nearer\\nto it, and more generally understand what it offers them,--when its\\nplay-grounds are ready, its walks more shaded,--when cheap and wholesome\\nmeals, to the saving, occasionally, of the dreary housewife\\'s daily\\npottering, are to be had upon it,--when its system of cheap cabs shall\\nhave been successfully inaugurated,--and when a daily discourse of sweet\\nsounds shall have been made an essential part of its functions in the\\nbody-politic.\\n\\nWe shall not probably live to see \"the gentility of Sir Philip Sidney\\nmade universal,\" but we do hope that we shall live to know many\\nresidents of towns of ten thousand population who will be ashamed to\\nsubscribe for the building of new churches while no public play-ground\\nis being prepared for their people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLIFE IN THE IRON-MILLS.\\n\\n  \"Is this the end?\\n  O Life, as futile, then, as frail!\\n  What hope of answer or redress?\"\\n\\n\\nA cloudy day: do you know what that is in a town of iron-works? The sky\\nsank down before dawn, muddy, flat, immovable. The air is thick, clammy\\nwith the breath of crowded human beings. It stifles me. I open the\\nwindow, and, looking out, can scarcely see through the rain the grocer\\'s\\nshop opposite, where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg\\ntobacco in their pipes. I can detect the scent through all the foul\\nsmells ranging loose in the air.\\n\\nThe idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke. It rolls sullenly in slow folds\\nfrom the great chimneys of the iron-foundries, and settles down in\\nblack, slimy pools on the muddy streets. Smoke on the wharves, smoke on\\nthe dingy boats, on the yellow river,--clinging in a coating of greasy\\nsoot to the house-front, the two faded poplars, the faces of the\\npassers-by. The long train of mules, dragging masses of pig-iron through\\nthe narrow street, have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides.\\nHere, inside, is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from\\nthe mantel-shelf; but even its wings are covered with smoke, clotted\\nand black. Smoke everywhere! A dirty canary chirps desolately in a\\ncage beside me. Its dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old\\ndream,--almost worn out, I think.\\n\\nFrom the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to\\nthe river-side, strewed with rain-butts and tubs. The river, dull and\\ntawny-, _(la belle riviere!)_ drags itself sluggishly along,\\ntired of the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges. What wonder? When I\\nwas a child, I used to fancy a look of weary, dumb appeal upon the face\\nof the <DW64>-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day.\\nSomething of the same idle notion comes to me to-day, when from the\\nstreet-window I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past,\\nnight and morning, to the great mills. Masses of men, with dull,\\nbesotted faces bent to the ground, sharpened here and there by pain\\nor cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes;\\nstooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal, laired by day in\\ndens of drunkenness and infamy; breathing from infancy to death an air\\nsaturated with fog and grease and soot, vileness for soul and body. What\\ndo you make of a case like that, amateur psychologist? You call it an\\naltogether serious thing to be alive: to these men it is a drunken jest,\\na joke,--horrible to angels perhaps, to them commonplace enough. My\\nfancy about the river was an idle one: it is no type of such a life.\\nWhat if it be stagnant and slimy here? It knows that beyond there waits\\nfor it odorous sunlight,--quaint old gardens, dusky with soft, green\\nfoliage of apple-trees, and flushing crimson with roses,--air, and\\nfields, and mountains. The future of the Welsh puddler passing just now\\nis not so pleasant. To be stowed away, after his grimy work is done, in\\na hole in the muddy graveyard, and after that,--_not_ air, nor green\\nfields, nor curious roses.\\n\\nCan you see how foggy the day is? As I stand here, idly tapping the\\nwindow-pane, and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and\\nthe coal-boats below, fragments of an old story float up before me,--a\\nstory of this old house into which I happened to come to-day. You may\\nthink it a tiresome story enough, as foggy as the day, sharpened by no\\nsudden flashes of pain or pleasure.--I know: only the outline of a dull\\nlife, that long since, with thousands of dull lives like its own, was\\nvainly lived and lost: thousands of them,--massed, vile, slimy lives,\\nlike those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt.--Lost?\\nThere is a curious point for you to settle, my friend, who study\\npsychology in a lazy, _dilettante_ way. Stop a moment. I am going to be\\nhonest. This is what I want you to do. I want you to hide your disgust,\\ntake no heed to your clean clothes, and come right down with me,--here,\\ninto the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia. I want you to\\nhear this story. There is a secret down here, in this nightmare fog,\\nthat has lain dumb for centuries: I want to make it a real thing to you.\\nYou, Egoist, or Pantheist, or Arminian, busy in making straight paths\\nfor your feet on the hills, do not see it clearly,--this terrible\\nquestion which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer. I dare\\nnot put this secret into words. I told you it was dumb. These men, going\\nby with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power, do not ask it\\nof Society or of God. Their lives ask it; their deaths ask it. There is\\nno reply. I will tell you plainly that I have a great hope; and I bring\\nit to you to be tested. It is this: that this terrible dumb question is\\nits own reply; that it is not the sentence of death we think it, but,\\nfrom the very extremity of its darkness, the most solemn prophecy which\\nthe world has known of the Hope to come. I dare make my meaning no\\nclearer, but will only tell my story. It will, perhaps, seem to you as\\nfoul and dark as this thick vapor about us, and as pregnant with death;\\nbut if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper, no perfume-tinted\\ndawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come.\\n\\nMy story is very simple,--only what I remember of the life of one\\nof these men,--a furnace-tender in one of Kirby & John\\'s\\nrolling-mills,--Hugh Wolfe. You know the mills? They took the great\\norder for the Lower Virginia railroads there last winter; run usually\\nwith about a thousand men. I cannot tell why I choose the half-forgotten\\nstory of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands.\\nPerhaps because there is a secret underlying sympathy between that story\\nand this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine,--or perhaps\\nsimply for the reason that this house is the one where the Wolfes lived.\\nThere were the father and son,--both hands, as I said, in one of Kirby\\n& John\\'s mills for making railroad-iron,--and Deborah, their cousin, a\\npicker in some of the cotton-mills. The house was rented then to half\\na dozen families. The Wolfes had two of the cellar-rooms. The old man,\\nlike many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills, was Welsh,--had\\nspent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines. You may pick the Welsh\\nemigrants, Cornish miners, out of the throng passing the windows, any\\nday. They are a trifle more filthy; their muscles are not so brawny;\\nthey stoop more. When they are drunk, they neither yell, nor shout, nor\\nstagger, but skulk along like beaten hounds. A pure, unmixed blood, I\\nfancy: shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharply-cut facial\\nlines. It is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes lived here. Their\\nlives were like those of their class: incessant labor, sleeping in\\nkennel-like rooms, eating rank pork and molasses, drinking--God and the\\ndistillers only know what; with an occasional night in jail, to atone\\nfor some drunken excess. Is that all of their lives?--of the portion\\ngiven to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets to-day?\\n--nothing beneath?--all? So many a political reformer will tell\\nyou,--and many a private reformer, too, who has gone among them with a\\nheart tender with Christ\\'s charity, and come out outraged, hardened.\\n\\nOne rainy night, about eleven o\\'clock, a crowd of half-clothed women\\nstopped outside of the cellar-door. They were going home from the\\ncotton-mill.\\n\\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" said one, a mulatto, steadying herself against the\\ngas-post. She needed the post to steady her. So did more than one of\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Dah\\'s a ball to Miss Potts\\' to-night. Ye\\'d best come.\"\\n\\n\"Inteet, Deb, if hur \\'ll come, hur \\'ll hef fun,\" said a shrill Welsh\\nvoice in the crowd.\\n\\nTwo or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman,\\nwho was groping for the latch of the door.\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"No? Where\\'s Kit Small, then?\"\\n\\n\"Begorra! on the spools. Alleys behint, though we helped her, we dud.\\nAn wid ye! Let Deb alone! It\\'s ondacent frettin\\' a quite body. Be\\nthe powers, an\\' we\\'ll have a night of it! there\\'ll be lashin\\'s o\\'\\ndrink,--the Vargent be blessed and praised for \\'t!\"\\n\\nThey went on, the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight, and drag\\nthe woman Wolfe off with them; but, being pacified, she staggered away.\\n\\nDeborah groped her way into the cellar, and, after considerable\\nstumbling, kindled a match, and lighted a tallow dip, that sent a yellow\\nglimmer over the room. It was low, damp,--the earthen floor covered with\\na green, slimy moss,--a fetid air smothering the breath. Old Wolfe lay\\nasleep on a heap of straw, wrapped in a torn horse-blanket. He was a\\npale, meek little man, with a white face and red rabbit-eyes. The woman\\nDeborah was like him; only her face was even more ghastly, her lips\\nbluer, her eyes more watery. She wore a faded cotton gown and a\\nslouching bonnet. When she walked, one could see that she was deformed,\\nalmost a hunchback. She trod softly, so as not to waken him, and went\\nthrough into the room beyond. There she found by the half-extinguished\\nfire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes, which she put\\nupon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale. Placing the old candlestick\\nbeside this dainty repast, she untied her bonnet, which hung limp and\\nwet over her face, and prepared to eat her supper. It was the first\\nfood that had touched her lips since morning. There was enough of it,\\nhowever: there is not always. She was hungry,--one could see that easily\\nenough,--and not drunk, as most of her companions would have been found\\nat this hour. She did not drink, this woman,--her face told that,\\ntoo,--nothing stronger than ale. Perhaps the weak, flaccid wretch had\\nsome stimulant in her pale life to keep her up,--some love or hope, it\\nmight be, or urgent need. When that stimulant was gone, she would take\\nto whiskey. Man cannot live by work alone. While she was skinning the\\npotatoes, and munching them, a noise behind her made her stop.\\n\\n\"Janey!\" she called, lifting the candle and peering into the darkness.\\n\"Janey, are you there?\"\\n\\nA heap of ragged coats was heaved up, and the face of a young girl\\nemerged, staring sleepily at the woman.\\n\\n\"Deborah,\" she said, at last, \"I\\'m here the night.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. Hur\\'s welcome,\" she said, quietly eating on.\\n\\nThe girl\\'s face was haggard and sickly; her eyes were heavy with sleep\\nand hunger: real Milesian eyes they were, dark, delicate blue, glooming\\nout from black shadows with a pitiful fright.\\n\\n\"I was alone,\" she said, timidly.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the father?\" asked Deborah, holding out a potato, which the\\ngirl greedily seized.\\n\\n\"He\\'s beyant,--wid Haley,--in the stone house.\" (Did you ever hear the\\nword _jail_ from an Irish mouth?) \"I came here. Hugh told me never to\\nstay me-lone.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nA vexed frown crossed her face. The girl saw it, and added quickly,--\\n\\n\"I have not seen Hugh the day, Deb. The old man says his watch lasts\\ntill the mornin\\'.\"\\n\\nThe woman sprang up, and hastily began to arrange some bread and flitch\\nin a tin pail, and to pour her own measure of ale into a bottle. Tying\\non her bonnet, she blew out the candle.\\n\\n\"Lay ye down, Janey dear,\" she said, gently, covering her with the old\\nrags. \"Hur can eat the potatoes, if hur \\'s hungry.\"\\n\\n\"Where are ye goin\\', Deb? The rain \\'s sharp.\"\\n\\n\"To the mill, with Hugh\\'s supper.\"\\n\\n\"Let him hide till th\\' morn. Sit ye down.\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\"--sharply pushing her off. \"The boy\\'ll starve.\"\\n\\nShe hurried from the cellar, while the child wearily coiled herself up\\nfor sleep. The rain was falling heavily, as the woman, pail in hand,\\nemerged from the mouth of the alley, and turned down the narrow street,\\nthat stretched out, long and black, miles before her. Here and there a\\nflicker of gas lighted an uncertain space of muddy footwalk and gutter;\\nthe long rows of houses, except an occasional lager-bier shop, were\\nclosed; now and then she met a band of mill-hands skulking to or from\\ntheir work.\\n\\nNot many even of the inhabitants of a manufacturing town know the vast\\nmachinery of system by which the bodies of workmen are governed, that\\ngoes on unceasingly from year to year. The hands of each mill are\\ndivided into watches that relieve each other as regularly as the\\nsentinels of an army. By night and day the work goes on, the unsleeping\\nengines groan and shriek, the fiery pools of metal boil and surge. Only\\nfor a day in the week, in half-courtesy to public censure, the fires are\\npartially veiled; but as soon as the clock strikes midnight, the great\\nfurnaces break forth with renewed fury, the clamor begins with fresh,\\nbreathless vigor, the engines sob and shriek like \"gods in pain.\"\\n\\nAs Deborah hurried down through the heavy rain, the noise of these\\nthousand engines sounded through the sleep and shadow of the city like\\nfar-off thunder. The mill to which she was going lay on the river, a\\nmile below the city-limits. It was far, and she was weak, aching from\\nstanding twelve hours at the spools. Yet it was her almost nightly walk\\nto take this man his supper, though at every square she sat down to\\nrest, and she knew she should receive small word of thanks.\\n\\nPerhaps, if she had possessed an artist\\'s eye, the picturesque oddity\\nof the scene might have made her step stagger less, and the path seem\\nshorter; but to her the mills were only \"summat deilish to look at by\\nnight.\"\\n\\nThe road leading to the mills had been quarried from the solid rock,\\nwhich rose abrupt and bare on one side of the cinder-covered road, while\\nthe river, sluggish and black, crept past on the other. The mills for\\nrolling iron are simply immense tent-like roofs, covering acres of\\nground, open on every side. Beneath these roofs Deborah looked in on a\\ncity of fires, that burned hot and fiercely in the night. Fire in every\\nhorrible form: pits of flame waving in the wind; liquid metal-flames\\nwrithing in tortuous streams through the sand; wide caldrons filled with\\nboiling fire, over which bent ghastly wretches stirring the strange\\nbrewing; and through all, crowds of half-clad men, looking like\\nrevengeful ghosts in the red light, hurried, throwing masses of\\nglittering fire. It was like a street in Hell. Even Deborah muttered, as\\nshe crept through, \"\\'T looks like t\\' Devil\\'s place!\" It did,--in more\\nways than one.\\n\\nShe found the man she was looking for, at last, heaping coal on a\\nfurnace. He had not time to eat his supper; so she went behind the\\nfurnace, and waited. Only a few men were with him, and they noticed her\\nonly by a \"Hyur comes t\\' hunchback, Wolfe.\"\\n\\nDeborah was stupid with sleep; her back pained her sharply; and her\\nteeth chattered with cold, with the rain that soaked her clothes and\\ndripped from her at every step. She stood, however, patiently holding\\nthe pail, and waiting.\\n\\n\"Hout, woman! ye look like a drowned cat. Come near to the fire,\"--said\\none of the men, approaching to scrape away the ashes.\\n\\nShe shook her head. Wolfe had forgotten her. He turned, hearing the man,\\nand came closer.\\n\\n\"I did no\\' think; gi\\' me my supper, woman.\"\\n\\nShe watched him eat with a painful eagerness. With a woman\\'s quick\\ninstinct, she saw that he was not hungry,--was eating to please her.\\nHer pale, watery eyes began to gather a strange light.\\n\\n\"Is\\'t good, Hugh? T\\'ale was a bit sour, I feared.\"\\n\\n\"No, good enough.\" He hesitated a moment. \"Ye\\'re tired, poor lass! Bide\\nhere till I go. Lay down there on that heap of ash, and go to sleep.\"\\n\\nHe threw her an old coat for a pillow, and turned to his work. The\\nheap was the refuse of the burnt iron, and was not a hard bed; the\\nhalf-smothered warmth, too, penetrated her limbs, dulling their pain and\\ncold shiver.\\n\\nMiserable enough she looked, lying there on the ashes like a limp,\\ndirty rag,--yet not an unfitting figure to crown the scene of hopeless\\ndiscomfort and veiled crime: more fitting, if one looked deeper into the\\nheart of things,--at her thwarted woman\\'s form, her colorless life, her\\nwaking stupor that smothered pain and hunger,--even more fit to be a\\ntype of her class. Deeper yet if one could look, was there nothing worth\\nreading in this wet, faded thing, half-covered with ashes? no story of a\\nsoul filled with groping passionate love, heroic unselfishness, fierce\\njealousy? of years of weary trying to please the one human being whom\\nshe loved, to gain one look of real heart-kindness from him? If anything\\nlike this were hidden beneath the pale, bleared eyes, and dull,\\nwashed-out-looking face, no one had ever taken the trouble to read its\\nfaint signs: not the half-clothed furnace-tender, Wolfe, certainly. Yet\\nhe was kind to her: it was his nature to be kind, even to the very rats\\nthat swarmed in the cellar: kind to her in just the same way. She knew\\nthat. And it might be that very knowledge had given to her face its\\napathy and vacancy more than her low, torpid life. One sees that\\ndead, vacant look steal sometimes over the rarest, finest of women\\'s\\nfaces,--in the very midst, it may be, of their warmest summer\\'s day; and\\nthen one can guess at the secret of intolerable solitude that lies hid\\nbeneath the delicate laces and brilliant smile. There was no warmth, no\\nbrilliancy, no summer for this woman; so the stupor and vacancy had time\\nto gnaw into her face perpetually. She was young, too, though no one\\nguessed it; so the gnawing was the fiercer.\\n\\nShe lay quiet in the dark corner, listening, through the monotonous din\\nand uncertain glare of the works, to the dull plash of the rain in the\\nfar distance,--shrinking back whenever the man Wolfe happened to look\\ntowards her. She knew, in spite of all his kindness, that there was that\\nin her face and form which made him loathe the sight of her. She felt by\\ninstinct, although she could not comprehend it, the finer nature of\\nthe man, which made him among his fellow-workmen something unique, set\\napart. She knew, that, down under all the vileness and coarseness of\\nhis life, there was a groping passion for whatever was beautiful and\\npure,--that his soul sickened with disgust at her deformity, even when\\nhis words were kindest. Through this dull consciousness, which never\\nleft her, came, like a sting, the recollection of the dark blue eyes and\\nlithe figure of the little Irish girl she had left in the cellar. The\\nrecollection struck through even her stupid intellect with a vivid glow\\nof beauty and of grace. Little Janey, timid, helpless, clinging to Hugh\\nas her only friend: that was the sharp thought, the bitter thought, that\\ndrove into the glazed eyes a fierce light of pain. You laugh at it? Are\\npain and jealousy less savage realities down here in this place I am\\ntaking you to than in your own house or your own heart,--your heart,\\nwhich they clutch at sometimes? The note is the same, I fancy, be the\\noctave high or low.\\n\\nIf you could go into this mill where Deborah lay, and drag out from the\\nhearts of these men the terrible tragedy of their lives, taking it as a\\nsymptom of the disease of their class, no ghost Horror would terrify\\nyou more. A reality of soul-starvation, of living death, that meets you\\nevery day under the besotted faces on the street,--I can paint nothing\\nof this, only give you the outside outlines of a night, a crisis in the\\nlife of one man: whatever muddy depth of soul-history lies beneath you\\ncan read according to the eyes God has given you.\\n\\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him as a spaniel its master, bent over the\\nfurnace with his iron pole, unconscious of her scrutiny, only stopping\\nto receive orders. Physically, Nature had promised the man but little.\\nHe had already lost the strength and instinct vigor of a man, his\\nmuscles were thin, his nerves weak, his face (a meek, woman\\'s face)\\nhaggard, yellow with consumption. In the mill he was known as one of the\\ngirl-men: \"Molly Wolfe\" was his _sobriquet_. He was never seen, in\\nthe cockpit, did not own a terrier, drank but seldom; when he did,\\ndesperately. He fought sometimes, but was always thrashed, pommelled to\\na jelly. The man was game enough, when his blood was up: but he was no\\nfavorite in the mill; he had the taint of school-learning on him,--not\\nto a dangerous extent, only a quarter or so in the free-school in fact,\\nbut enough to ruin him as a good hand in a fight.\\n\\nFor other reasons, too, he was not popular. Not one of themselves, they\\nfelt that, though outwardly as filthy and ash-covered; silent, with\\nforeign thoughts and longings breaking out through his quietness in\\ninnumerable curious ways: this one, for instance. In the neighboring\\nfurnace-buildings lay great heaps of the refuse from the ore after the\\npig-metal is run. _Korl_ we call it here: a light, porous substance, of\\na delicate, waxen, flesh- tinge. Out of the blocks of this korl,\\nWolfe, in his off-hours from the furnace, had a habit of chipping and\\nmoulding figures,--hideous, fantastic enough, but sometimes strangely\\nbeautiful: even the mill-men saw that, while they jeered at him. It was\\na curious fancy in the man, almost a passion. The few hours for rest he\\nspent hewing and hacking with his blunt knife, never speaking, until his\\nwatch came again,--working at one figure for months, and, when it was\\nfinished, breaking it to pieces perhaps, in a fit of disappointment. A\\nmorbid, gloomy man, untaught, unled, left to feed his soul in grossness\\nand crime, and hard, grinding labor.\\n\\nI want you to come down and look at this Wolfe, standing there among the\\nlowest of his kind, and see him just as he is, that you may judge him\\njustly when you hear the story of this night. I want you to look back,\\nas he does every day, at his birth in vice, his starved infancy; to\\nremember the heavy years he has groped through as boy and man,--the\\nslow, heavy years of constant, hot work. So long ago he began, that he\\nthinks sometimes he has worked there for ages. There is no hope that it\\nwill ever end. Think that God put into this man\\'s soul a fierce thirst\\nfor beauty,--to know it, to create it; to _be_--something, he knows not\\nwhat,--other than he is. There are moments when a passing cloud, the sun\\nglinting on the purple thistles, a kindly smile, a child\\'s face, will\\nrouse him to a passion of pain,--when his nature starts up with a mad\\ncry of rage against God, man, whoever it is that has forced this vile,\\nslimy life upon him. With all this groping, this mad desire, a great\\nblind intellect stumbling through wrong, a loving poet\\'s heart, the man\\nwas by habit only a coarse, vulgar laborer, familiar with sights and\\nwords you would blush to name. Be just; when I tell you about this\\nnight, see him as he is. Be just,--not like man\\'s law, which seizes on\\none isolated fact, but like God\\'s judging angel, whose clear, sad\\neye saw all the countless cankering days of this man\\'s life, all the\\ncountless nights, when, sick with starving, his soul fainted in him,\\nbefore it judged him for this night, the saddest of all.\\n\\nI called this night the crisis of his life. If it was, it stole on him\\nunawares. These great turning-days of life cast no shadow before, slip\\nby unconsciously. Only a trifle, a little turn of the rudder, and the\\nship goes to heaven or hell.\\n\\nWolfe, while Deborah watched him, dug into the furnace of melting iron\\nwith his pole, dully thinking only how many rails the lump would yield.\\nIt was late,--nearly Sunday morning; another hour, and the heavy work\\nwould be done,--only the furnaces to replenish and cover for the next\\nday. The workmen were growing more noisy, shouting, as they had to do,\\nto be heard over the deep clamor of the mills. Suddenly they grew less\\nboisterous,--at the far end, entirely silent. Something unusual had\\nhappened. After a moment, the silence came nearer; the men stopped their\\njeers and drunken choruses. Deborah, stupidly lifting up her head,\\nsaw the cause of the quiet. A group of five or six men were slowly\\napproaching, stopping to examine each furnace as they came. Visitors\\noften came to see the mills after night: except by growing less noisy,\\nthe men took no notice of them. The furnace where Wolfe worked was near\\nthe bounds of the works; they halted there hot and tired: a walk over\\none of these great foundries is no trifling task. The woman, drawing out\\nof sight, turned over to sleep. Wolfe, seeing them stop, suddenly roused\\nfrom his indifferent stupor, and watched them keenly. He knew some\\nof them: the overseer, Clarke,--a son of Kirby, one of the\\nmill-owners,--and a Doctor May, one of the town-physicians. The other\\ntwo were strangers. Wolfe came closer. He seized eagerly every chance\\nthat brought him into contact with this mysterious class that shone down\\non him perpetually with the glamour of another order of being. What made\\nthe difference between them? That was the mystery of his life. He had\\na vague notion that perhaps to-night he could find it out. One of the\\nstrangers sat down on a pile of bricks, and beckoned young Kirby to his\\nside.\\n\\n\"This _is_ hot, with a vengeance. A match, please?\"--lighting his cigar.\\n\"But the walk is worth the trouble. If it were not that you must have\\nheard it so often, Kirby, I would tell you that your works look like\\nDante\\'s Inferno.\"\\n\\nKirby laughed.\\n\\n\"Yes. Yonder is Farinata himself in the burning tomb,\"--pointing to some\\nfigure in the shimmering shadows.\\n\\n\"Judging from some of the faces of your men,\" said the other, \"they bid\\nfair to try the reality of Dante\\'s vision, some day.\"\\n\\nYoung Kirby looked curiously around, as if seeing the faces of his hands\\nfor the first time.\\n\\n\"They\\'re bad enough, that\\'s true. A desperate set, I fancy. Eh, Clarke?\"\\n\\nThe overseer did not hear him. He was talking of net profits just\\nthen,--giving, in fact, a schedule of the annual business of the firm to\\na sharp peering little Yankee, who jotted down notes on a paper laid on\\nthe crown of his hat: a reporter for one of the city-papers, getting up\\na series of reviews of the leading manufactories. The other gentlemen\\nhad accompanied them merely for amusement. They were silent until the\\nnotes were finished, drying their feet at the furnaces, and sheltering\\ntheir faces from the intolerable heat. At last the overseer concluded\\nwith--\"I believe that is a pretty fair estimate, Captain.\"\\n\\n\"Here, some of you men!\" said Kirby, \"bring up those boards. We may as\\nwell sit down, gentlemen, until the rain is over. It cannot last much\\nlonger at this rate.\"\\n\\n\"Pig-metal,\"--mumbled the reporter,--\"um!--coal facilities,--um!--hands\\nemployed, twelve hundred,--bitumen,--um!--\\'all right, I believe, Mr.\\nClarke;--sinking-fund,--what did you say was your sinking-fund?\"\\n\\n\"Twelve hundred hands?\" said the stranger, the young man who had first\\nspoken. \"Do you control their votes, Kirby?\"\\n\\n\"Control? No.\" The young man smiled complacently. \"But my father brought\\nseven hundred votes to the polls for his candidate last November. No\\nforce-work, you understand,--only a speech or two, a hint to form\\nthemselves into a society, and a bit of red and blue bunting to make\\nthem a flag. The Invincible Roughs,--I believe that is their name. I\\nforget the motto: \\'Our country\\'s hope,\\' I think.\"\\n\\nThere was a laugh. The young man talking to Kirby sat with an amused\\nlight in his cool gray eye, surveying critically the half-clothed\\nfigures of the puddlers, and the slow swing of their brawny muscles. He\\nwas a stranger in the city,--spending a couple of months in the\\nborders of a Slave State, to study the institutions of the South,--a\\nbrother-in-law of Kirby\\'s,--Mitchell. He was an amateur gymnast,--hence\\nhis anatomical eye; a patron, in a _blase_ way, of the prize-ring; a man\\nwho sucked the essence out of a science or philosophy in an indifferent,\\ngentlemanly way; who took Kant, Novalis, Humboldt, for what they were\\nworth in his own scales; accepting all, despising nothing, in heaven,\\nearth, or hell, but one-idead men; with a temper yielding and brilliant\\nas summer water, until his Self was touched, when it was ice, though\\nbrilliant still. Such men are not rare in the States.\\n\\nAs he knocked the ashes from his cigar, Wolfe caught with a quick\\npleasure the contour of the white hand, the blood-glow of a red ring he\\nwore. His voice, too, and that of Kirby\\'s, touched him like music,--low,\\neven, with chording cadences. About this man Mitchell hung the\\nimpalpable atmosphere belonging to the thorough-bred gentleman. Wolfe,\\nscraping away the ashes beside him, was conscious of it, did obeisance\\nto it with his artist sense, unconscious that he did so.\\n\\nThe rain did not cease. Clarke and the reporter left the mills; the\\nothers, comfortably seated near the furnace, lingered, smoking\\nand talking in a desultory way. Greek would not have been more\\nunintelligible to the furnace-tenders, whose presence they soon forgot\\nentirely. Kirby drew out a newspaper from his pocket and read aloud some\\narticle, which they discussed eagerly. At every sentence, Wolfe listened\\nmore and more like a dumb, hopeless animal, with a duller, more stolid\\nlook creeping over his face, glancing now and then at Mitchell, marking\\nacutely every smallest sign of refinement, then back to himself, seeing\\nas in a mirror his filthy body, his more stained soul.\\n\\nNever! He had no words for such a thought, but he knew now, in all the\\nsharpness of the bitter certainty, that between them there was a great\\ngulf never to be passed. Never!\\n\\nThe bell of the mills rang for midnight. Sunday morning had dawned.\\nWhatever hidden message lay in the tolling bells floated past these men\\nunknown. Yet it was there. Veiled in the solemn music ushering the risen\\nSaviour was a key-note to solve the darkest secrets of a world gone\\nwrong,--even this social riddle which the brain of the grimy puddler\\ngrappled with madly to-night.\\n\\nThe men began to withdraw the metal from the caldrons. The mills were\\ndeserted on Sundays, except by the hands who fed the fires, and those\\nwho had no lodgings and slept usually on the ash-heaps. The three\\nstrangers sat still during the next hour, watching the men cover the\\nfurnaces, laughing now and then at some jest of Kirby\\'s.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" said Mitchell, \"I like this view of the works better than\\nwhen the glare was fiercest? These heavy shadows and the amphitheatre\\nof smothered fires are ghostly, unreal. One could fancy these red\\nsmouldering lights to be the half-shut eyes of wild beasts, and the\\nspectral figures their victims in the den.\"\\n\\nKirby laughed. \"You are fanciful. Come, let us get out of the den. The\\nspectral figures, as you call them, are a little too real for me to\\nfancy a close proximity in the darkness,--unarmed, too.\"\\n\\nThe others rose, buttoning their overcoats, and lighting cigars.\\n\\n\"Raining, still,\" said Doctor May, \"and hard. Where did we leave the\\ncoach, Mitchell?\"\\n\\n\"At the other side of the works.--Kirby, what\\'s that?\"\\n\\nMitchell started back, half-frightened, as, suddenly turning a corner,\\nthe white figure of a woman faced him in the darkness,--a woman, white,\\nof giant proportions, crouching on the ground, her arms flung out in\\nsome wild gesture of warning.\\n\\n\"Stop! Make that fire burn there!\" cried Kirby, stopping short.\\n\\nThe flame burst out, flashing the gaunt figure into bold relief.\\n\\nMitchell drew a long breath.\\n\\n\"I thought it was alive,\" he said, going up curiously.\\n\\nThe others followed.\\n\\n\"Not marble, eh?\" asked Kirby, touching it.\\n\\nOne of the lower overseers stopped.\\n\\n\"Korl, Sir.\"\\n\\n\"Who did it?\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t say. Some of the hands; chipped it out in off-hours.\"\\n\\n\"Chipped to some purpose, I should say. What a flesh-tint the stuff has!\\nDo you see, Mitchell?\"\\n\\n\"I see.\"\\n\\nHe had stepped aside where the light fell boldest on the figure, looking\\nat it in silence. There was not one line of beauty or grace in it: a\\nnude woman\\'s form, muscular, grown coarse with labor, the powerful limbs\\ninstinct with some one poignant longing. One idea: there it was in the\\ntense, rigid muscles, the clutching hands, the wild, eager face, like\\nthat of a starving wolf\\'s. Kirby and Doctor May walked around it,\\ncritical, curious. Mitchell stood aloof, silent. The figure touched him\\nstrangely.\\n\\n\"Not badly done,\" said Doctor May. \"Where did the fellow learn that\\nsweep of the muscles in the arm and hand? Look at them! They are\\ngroping,--do you see?--clutching: the peculiar action of a man dying of\\nthirst.\"\\n\\n\"They have ample facilities for studying anatomy,\" sneered Kirby,\\nglancing at the half-naked figures.\\n\\n\"Look,\" continued the Doctor, \"at this bony wrist, and the strained\\nsinews of the instep! A working-woman,--the very type of her class.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid!\" muttered Mitchell.\\n\\n\"Why?\" demanded May. \"What does the fellow intend by the figure? I\\ncannot catch the meaning.\"\\n\\n\"Ask him,\" said the other, dryly. \"There he stands,\"--pointing to Wolfe,\\nwho stood with a group of men, leaning on his ash-rake.\\n\\nThe Doctor beckoned him with the affable smile which kind-hearted men\\nput on, when talking to these people.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mitchell has picked you out as the man who did this,--I\\'m sure I\\ndon\\'t know why. But what did you mean by it?\"\\n\\n\"She be hungry.\"\\n\\nWolfe\\'s eyes answered Mitchell, not the Doctor.\\n\\n\"Oh-h! But what a mistake you have made, my fine fellow! You have given\\nno sign of starvation to the body. It is strong,--terribly strong. It\\nhas the mad, half-despairing gesture of drowning.\"\\n\\nWolfe stammered, glanced appealingly at Mitchell, who saw the soul of\\nthe thing, he knew. But the cool, probing eyes were turned on himself\\nnow,--mocking, cruel, relentless.\\n\\n\"Not hungry for meat,\" the furnace-tender said at last.\\n\\n\"What then? Whiskey?\" jeered Kirby, with a coarse laugh.\\n\\nWolfe was silent a moment, thinking.\\n\\n\"I dunno,\" he said, with a bewildered look. \"It mebbe. Summat to make\\nher live, I think,--like you. Whiskey ull do it, in a way.\"\\n\\nThe young man laughed again. Mitchell flashed a look of disgust\\nsomewhere,--not at Wolfe.\\n\\n\"May,\" he broke out impatiently, \"are you blind? Look at that woman\\'s\\nface! It asks questions of God, and says, \\'I have a right to know.\\' Good\\nGod, how hungry it is!\"\\n\\nThey looked a moment; then May turned to the mill-owner:--\\n\\n\"Have you many such hands as this? What are you going to do with them?\\nKeep them at puddling iron?\"\\n\\nKirby shrugged his shoulders. Mitchell\\'s look had irritated him.\\n\\n\"_Ce n\\'est pas mon affaire_. I have no fancy for nursing infant\\ngeniuses. I suppose there are some stray gleams of mind and soul among\\nthese wretches. The Lord will take care of his own; or else they can\\nwork out their own salvation. I have heard you call our American system\\na ladder which any man can scale. Do you doubt it? Or perhaps you want\\nto banish all social ladders, and put us all on a flat table-land,--eh,\\nMay?\"\\n\\nThe Doctor looked vexed, puzzled. Some terrible problem lay hid in this\\nwoman\\'s face, and troubled these men. Kirby waited for an answer, and,\\nreceiving none, went on, warning with his subject.\\n\\n\"I tell you, there\\'s something wrong that no talk of \\'_Liberte_\\' or\\n\\'_Egalite_\\' will do away. If I had the making of men, these men who\\ndo the lowest part of the world\\'s work should be machines,--nothing\\nmore,--hands. It would be kindness. God help them! What are taste,\\nreason, to creatures who must live such lives as that?\" He pointed to\\nDeborah, sleeping on the ash-heap. \"So many nerves to sting them to\\npain. What if God had put your brain, with all its agony of touch, into\\nyour fingers, and bid you work and strike with that?\"\\n\\n\"You think you could govern the world better?\" laughed the Doctor.\\n\\n\"I do not think at all.\"\\n\\n\"That is true philosophy. Drift with the stream, because you cannot dive\\ndeep enough to find bottom, eh?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" rejoined Kirby. \"I do not think. I wash my hands of all\\nsocial problems,--slavery, caste, white or black. My duty to my\\noperatives has a narrow limit,--the pay-hour on Saturday night. Outside\\nof that, if they cut korl, or cut each other\\'s throats, (the more\\npopular amusement of the two,) I am not responsible.\"\\n\\nThe Doctor sighed,--a good honest sigh, from the depths of his stomach.\\n\\n\"God help us! Who is responsible?\"\\n\\n\"Not I, I tell you,\" said Kirby, testily. \"What has the man who pays\\nthem money to do with their souls\\' concerns, more than the grocer or\\nbutcher who takes it?\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said Mitchell\\'s cynical voice, \"look at her! How hungry she\\nis!\"\\n\\nKirby tapped his boot with his cane. No one spoke. Only the dumb face of\\nthe rough image looking into their faces with the awful question, \"What\\nshall we do to be saved?\" Only Wolfe\\'s face, with its heavy weight of\\nbrain, its weak, uncertain mouth, its desperate eyes, out of which\\nlooked the soul of his class,--only Wolfe\\'s face turned towards Kirby\\'s.\\nMitchell laughed,--a cool, musical laugh.\\n\\n\"Money has spoken!\" he said, seating himself lightly on a stone with the\\nair of an amused spectator at a play. \"Are you answered?\"--turning to\\nWolfe his clear, magnetic face.\\n\\nBright and deep and cold as Arctic air, the soul of the man lay tranquil\\nbeneath. He looked at the furnace-tender as he had looked at a rare\\nmosaic in the morning; only the man was the more amusing study of the\\ntwo.\\n\\n\"Are you answered? Why, May, look at him! \\'_De profundis clamavi_.\\' Or,\\nto quote in English, \\'Hungry and thirsty, his soul faints in him.\\' And\\nso Money sends back its answer into the depths through you, Kirby!\\nVery clear the answer, too!--I think I remember reading the same words\\nsomewhere:--washing your hands in Eau de Cologne, and saying, \\'I am\\ninnocent of the blood of this man. See ye to it!\\'\"\\n\\nKirby flushed angrily.\\n\\n\"You quote Scripture freely.\"\\n\\n\"Do I not quote correctly? I think I remember another line, which may\\namend my meaning: \\'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these,\\nye did it unto me.\\' Deist? Bless you, man, I was raised on the milk of\\nthe Word. Now, Doctor, the pocket of the world having uttered its\\nvoice, what has the heart to say? You are a philanthropist, in a small\\nway,--_n\\'est ce pas_? Here, boy, this gentleman can show you how to cut\\nkorl better,--or your destiny. Go on, May!\"\\n\\n\"I think a mocking devil possesses you to-night,\" rejoined the Doctor,\\nseriously.\\n\\nHe went to Wolfe and put his hand kindly on his arm. Something of a\\nvague idea possessed the Doctor\\'s brain that much good was to be done\\nhere by a friendly word or two: a latent genius to be warmed into life\\nby a waited-for sunbeam. Here it was: he had brought it. So he went on\\ncomplacently:--\\n\\n\"Do you know, boy, you have it in you to be a great sculptor, a great\\nman?--do you understand?\" (talking down to the capacity of his hearer:\\nit is a way people have with children, and men like Wolfe,)--\"to live a\\nbetter, stronger life than I, or Mr. Kirby here? A man may make himself\\nanything he chooses. God has given you stronger powers than many\\nmen,--me, for instance.\"\\n\\nMay stopped, heated, glowing with his own magnanimity. And it was\\nmagnanimous. The puddler had drunk in every word, looking through the\\nDoctor\\'s flurry, and generous heat, and self-approval, into his will,\\nwith those slow, absorbing eyes of his.\\n\\n\"Make yourself what you will. It is your right.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" quietly. \"Will you help me?\"\\n\\nMitchell laughed again. The Doctor turned now, in a passion,--\\n\\n\"You know, Mitchell, I have not the means. You know, if I had, it is in\\nmy heart to take this boy and educate him for\"----\\n\\n\"The glory of God, and the glory of John May.\"\\n\\nMay did not speak for a moment; then, controlled, he said,--\\n\\n\"Why should one be raised, when myriads are left?--I have not the money,\\nboy,\" to Wolfe, shortly.\\n\\n\"Money?\" He said it over slowly, as one repeals the guessed answer to a\\nriddle, doubtfully. \"That is it? Money?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, money,--that is it,\" said Mitchell, rising, and drawing his\\nfurred coat about him. \"You\\'ve found the cure for all the world\\'s\\ndiseases.--Come, May, find your good-humor, and come home. This damp\\nwind chills my very bones. Come and preach your Saint-Simonian doctrines\\nto-morrow to Kirby\\'s hands. Let them have a clear idea of the rights of\\nthe soul, and I\\'ll venture next week they\\'ll strike for higher wages.\\nThat will be the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"Will you send the coach-driver to this side of the mills?\" asked Kirby,\\nturning to Wolfe.\\n\\nHe spoke kindly: it was his habit to do so. Deborah, seeing the puddler\\ngo, crept after him. The three men waited outside. Doctor May walked up\\nand down, chafed. Suddenly he stopped.\\n\\n\"Go back, Mitchell! You say the pocket and the heart of the world speak\\nwithout meaning to these people. What has its head to say? Taste,\\nculture, refinement? Go!\"\\n\\nMitchell was leaning against a brick wall. He turned his head\\nindolently, and looked into the mills. There hung about the place a\\nthick, unclean odor. The slightest motion of his hand marked that he\\nperceived it, and his insufferable disgust. That was all. May said\\nnothing, only quickened his angry tramp.\\n\\n\"Besides,\" added Mitchell, giving a corollary to his answer, \"it would\\nbe of no use. I am not one of them.\"\\n\\n\"You do not mean\"--said May, facing him.\\n\\n\"Yes, I mean just that. Reform is born of need, not pity. No vital\\nmovement of the people\\'s has worked down, for good or evil; fermented,\\ninstead, carried up the heaving, cloggy mass. Think back through\\nhistory, and you will know it. What will this lowest deep--thieves,\\nMagdalens, <DW64>s--do with the light filtered through ponderous Church\\ncreeds, Baconian theories, Goethe schemes? Some day, out of their bitter\\nneed will be thrown up their own light-bringer,--their Jean Paul, their\\nCromwell, their Messiah.\"\\n\\n\"Bah!\" was the Doctor\\'s inward criticism. However, in practice, he\\nadopted the theory; for, when, night and morning, afterwards, he prayed\\nthat power might be given these degraded souls to rise, he glowed at\\nheart, recognizing an accomplished duty.\\n\\nWolfe and the woman had stood in the shadow of the works as the coach\\ndrove off. The Doctor had held out his hand in a frank, generous way,\\ntelling him to \"take care of himself, and to remember it was his right\\nto rise.\" Mitchell had simply touched his hat, as to an equal, with a\\nquiet look of thorough recognition. Kirby had thrown Deborah some money,\\nwhich she found, and clutched eagerly enough. They were gone now, all\\nof them. The man sat down on the cinder-road, looking up into the murky\\nsky.\\n\\n\"\\'T be late, Hugh. Wunnot hur come?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head doggedly, and the woman crouched out of his sight\\nagainst the wall. Do you remember rare moments when a sudden\\nlight flashed over yourself, your world, God? when you stood on a\\nmountain-peak, seeing your life as it might have been, as it is? one\\nquick instant, when custom lost its force and every-day usage? when your\\nfriend, wife, brother, stood in a new light? your soul was bared, and\\nthe grave,--a foretaste of the nakedness of the Judgment-Day? So it came\\nbefore him, his life, that night. The slow tides of pain he had borne\\ngathered themselves up and surged against his soul. His squalid daily\\nlife, the brutal coarseness eating into his brain, as the ashes into\\nhis skin: before, these things had been a dull aching into his\\nconsciousness; to-night, they were reality. He griped the filthy red\\nshirt that clung, stiff with soot, about him, and tore it savagely from\\nhis arm. The flesh beneath was muddy with grease and ashes,--and the\\nheart beneath that! And the soul? God knows.\\n\\nThen flashed before his vivid poetic sense the man who had left\\nhim,--the pure face, the delicate, sinewy limbs, in harmony with all he\\nknew of beauty or truth. In his cloudy fancy he had pictured a Something\\nlike this. He had found it in this Mitchell, even when he idly scoffed\\nat his pain: a Man all-knowing, all-seeing, crowned by Nature,\\nreigning,--the keen glance of his eye falling like a sceptre on other\\nmen. And yet his instinct taught him that he too--He! He looked at\\nhimself with sudden loathing, sick, wrung his hands with a cry, and then\\nwas silent. With all the phantoms of his heated, ignorant fancy, Wolfe\\nhad not been vague in his ambitious. They were practical, slowly built\\nup before him out of his knowledge of what he could do. Through years\\nhe had day by day made this hope a real thing to himself,--a clear,\\nprojected figure of himself, as he might become.\\n\\nAble to speak, to know what was best, to raise these men and women\\nworking at his side up with him: sometimes he forgot this defined hope\\nin the frantic anguish to escape,--only to escape,--out of the wet, the\\npain, the ashes, somewhere, anywhere,--only for one moment of free air\\non a hill-side, to lie down and let his sick soul throb itself out in\\nthe sunshine. But to-night he panted for life. The savage strength of\\nhis nature was roused; his cry was fierce to God for justice.\\n\\n\"Look at me!\" he said to Deborah, with a low, bitter laugh, striking his\\npuny chest savagely. \"What am I worth, Deb? Is it my fault that I am no\\nbetter? My fault? My fault?\"\\n\\nHe stopped, stung with a sudden remorse, seeing her hunchback shape\\nwrithing with sobs. For Deborah was crying thankless tears, according to\\nthe fashion of women.\\n\\n\"God forgi\\' me, woman! Things go harder wi\\' you nor me. It\\'s a worse\\nshare.\"\\n\\nHe got up and helped her to rise; and they went doggedly down the muddy\\nstreet, side by side.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all wrong,\" he muttered, slowly,--\"all wrong! I dunnot\\nunderstan\\'. But it\\'ll end some day.\"\\n\\n\"Come home, Hugh!\" she said, coaxingly; for he had stopped, looking\\naround bewildered.\\n\\n\"Home,--and back to the mill!\" He went on saying this over to himself,\\nas if he would mutter down every pain in this dull despair.\\n\\nShe followed him through the fog, her blue lips chattering with cold.\\nThey reached the cellar at last. Old Wolfe had been drinking since she\\nwent out, and had crept nearer the door. The girl Janey slept heavily In\\nthe corner. He went up to her, touching softly the worn white arm with\\nhis fingers. Some bitterer thought stung him, as he stood there. He\\nwiped the drops from his forehead, and went into the room beyond, livid,\\ntrembling. A hope, trifling, perhaps, but very dear, had died just then\\nout of the poor puddler\\'s life, as he looked at the sleeping, innocent\\ngirl,--some plan for the future, in which she had borne a part. He gave\\nit up that moment, then and forever. Only a trifle, perhaps, to us: his\\nface grew a shade paler,--that was all. But, somehow, the man\\'s soul, as\\nGod and the angels looked down on it, never was the same afterwards.\\n\\nDeborah followed him into the inner room. She carried a candle, which\\nshe placed on the floor, dosing the door after her. She had seen the\\nlook on his face, as he turned away: her own grew deadly. Yet, as she\\ncame up to him, her eyes glowed. He was seated on an old chest, quiet,\\nholding his face in his hands.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she said, softly.\\n\\nHe did not speak.\\n\\n\"Hugh, did hur hear what the man said,--him with the clear voice? Did\\nhur hear? Money, money,--that it wud do all?\"\\n\\nHe pushed her away,--gently, but he was worn out; her rasping tone\\nfretted him.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\"\\n\\nThe candle flared a pale yellow light over the cobwebbed brick walls,\\nand the woman standing there. He looked at her. She was young, in deadly\\nearnest; her faded eyes, and wet, ragged figure caught from their\\nfrantic eagerness a power akin to beauty.\\n\\n\"Hugh, it is true! Money ull do it! Oh, Hugh, boy, listen till me! He\\nsaid it true! It is money!\"\\n\\n\"I know. Go back! I do not want you here.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh, it is t\\' last time. I \\'II never worrit hur again.\"\\n\\nThere were tears in her voice now, but she choked them back.\\n\\n\"Hear till me only to-night! If one of t\\' witch people wud come, them we\\nheard of t\\' home, and gif hur all hur wants, what then? Say, Hugh!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean money.\".\\n\\nHer whisper shrilled through his brain.\\n\\n\"If one of t\\' witch dwarfs wud come from t\\' lane moors to-night, and gif\\nhur money, to go out,--_out_, I say,--out, lad, where t\\' sun shines, and\\nt\\' heath grows, and t\\' ladies walk in silken gownds, and God stays all\\nt\\' time,--where t\\' man lives that talked to us to-night,--Hugh knows,\\n--Hugh could walk there like a king!\"\\n\\nHe thought the woman mad, tried to check her, but she went on, fierce in\\nher eager haste.\\n\\n\"If _I_ were t\\' witch dwarf, if I had f money, wud hur thank me? Wud hur\\ntake me out o\\' this place wid hur and Janey? I wud not come into the\\ngran\\' house hur wud build, to vex hur wid t\\' hunch,--only at night, when\\nt\\' shadows were dark, stand far off to see hur.\"\\n\\nMad? Yes! Are many of us mad in this way?\\n\\n\"Poor Deb! poor Deb!\" he said, soothingly.\\n\\n\"It is here,\" she said, suddenly jerking into his hand a small roll.\\n\"I took it! I did it! Me, me!--not hur! I shall be hanged, I shall be\\nburnt in hell, if anybody knows I took it! Out of his pocket, as he\\nleaned against t\\' bricks. Hur knows?\"\\n\\nShe thrust it into his hand, and then, her errand done, began to gather\\nchips together to make a fire, choking down hysteric sobs.\\n\\n\"Has it come to this?\"\\n\\nThat was all he said. The Welsh Wolfe blood was honest. The roll was a\\nsmall green pocket-book containing one or two gold pieces, and a check\\nfor an incredible amount, as it seemed to the poor puddler. He laid it\\ndown, hiding his face again in his hands.\\n\\n\"Hugh, don\\'t be angry wud me! It\\'s only poor Deb,--hur knows?\"\\n\\nHe took the long skinny fingers kindly in his.\\n\\n\"Angry? God help me, no! Let me sleep. I am tired.\"\\n\\nHe threw himself heavily down on the wooden bench, stunned with pain and\\nweariness. She brought some old rags to cover him.\\n\\nIt was late on Sunday evening before he awoke. I tell God\\'s truth, when\\nI say he had then no thought of keeping this money. Deborah had hid it\\nin his pocket. He found it there. She watched him eagerly, as he took it\\nout.\\n\\n\"I must gif it to him,\" he said, reading her face.\\n\\n\"Hur knows,\" she said with a bitter sigh of disappointment. \"But it is\\nhur right to keep it.\"\\n\\nHis right! The word struck him. Doctor May had used the same. He washed\\nhimself, and went out to find this man Mitchell. His right! Why did this\\nchance word cling to him so obstinately? Do you hear the fierce devils\\nwhisper in his ear, as he went slowly down the darkening street?\\n\\nThe evening came on, slow and calm. He seated himself at the end of\\nan alley leading into one of the larger streets. His brain was clear\\nto-night, keen, intent, mastering. It would not start back, cowardly,\\nfrom any hellish temptation, but meet it face to face. Therefore the\\ngreat temptation of his life came to him veiled by no sophistry, but\\nbold, defiant, owning its own vile name, trusting to one bold blow for\\nvictory.\\n\\nHe did not deceive himself. Theft! That was it. At first the word\\nsickened him; then he grappled with it. Sitting there on a broken\\ncart-wheel, the fading day, the noisy groups, the church-bells\\' tolling\\npassed before him like a panorama, while the sharp struggle went on\\nwithin. This money! He took it out, and looked at it. If he gave it\\nback, what then? He was going to be cool about it.\\n\\nPeople going by to church saw only a sickly mill-boy watching them\\nquietly at the alley\\'s mouth. They did not know that he was mad, or they\\nwould not have gone by so quietly: mad with hunger; stretching out his\\nhands to the world, that had given so much to them, for leave to live\\nthe life God meant him to live. His soul within him was smothering to\\ndeath; he wanted so much, thought so much, and _knew_--nothing. There\\nwas nothing of which he was certain, except the mill and things there.\\nOf God and heaven he had heard so little, that they were to him what\\nfairy-land is to a child: something real, but not here; very far off.\\nHis brain, greedy, dwarfed, full of thwarted energy and unused powers,\\nquestioned these men and women going by, coldly, bitterly, that night.\\nWas it not his right to live as they,--a pure life, a good, true-hearted\\nlife, full of beauty and kind words? He only wanted to know how to use\\nthe strength within him. His heart warmed, as he thought of it. He\\nsuffered himself to think of it longer. If he took the money?\\n\\nThen he saw himself as he might be, strong, helpful, kindly. The night\\ncrept on, as this one image slowly evolved itself from the crowd of\\nother thoughts and stood triumphant. He looked at it. As he might be!\\nWhat wonder, if it blinded him to delirium,--the madness that underlies\\nall revolution, all progress, and all fall?\\n\\nYou laugh at the shallow temptation? You see the error underlying\\nits argument so clearly,--that to him a true life was one of full\\ndevelopment rather than self-restraint? that he was deaf to the higher\\ntone in a cry of voluntary suffering for truth\\'s sake than in the\\nfullest flow of spontaneous harmony? I do not plead his cause. I only\\nwant to show you the mote in my brother\\'s eye: then you can see clearly\\nto take it out.\\n\\nThe money,--there it lay on his knee, a little blotted slip of paper,\\nnothing in itself; used to raise him out of the pit; something straight\\nfrom God\\'s hand. A thief! Well, what was it to be a thief? He met the\\nquestion at last, face to face, wiping the clammy drops of sweat\\nfrom his forehead. God made this money--the fresh air, too--for his\\nchildren\\'s use. He never made the difference between poor and rich. The\\nSomething who looked down on him that moment through the cool gray sky\\nhad a kindly face, he knew,--loved his children alike. Oh, he knew that!\\n\\nThere were times when the soft floods of color in the crimson and purple\\nflames, or the clear depth of amber in the water below the bridge, had\\nsomehow given him a glimpse of another world than this,--of an infinite\\ndepth of beauty and of quiet somewhere,--somewhere,--a depth of quiet\\nand rest and love. Looking up now, it became strangely real. The sun had\\nsunk quite below the hills, but his last rays struck upward, touching\\nthe zenith. The fog had risen, and the town and river were steeped in\\nits thick, gray damp; but overhead, the sun-touched smoke-clouds opened\\nlike a cleft ocean,--shifting, rolling seas of crimson mist, waves of\\nbillowy silver reined with blood-scarlet, inner depths unfathomable of\\nglancing light. Wolfe\\'s artist-eye grew drunk with color. The gates of\\nthat other world! Fading, flashing before him now! What, in that world\\nof Beauty, Content, and Right, were the petty laws, the mine and thine,\\nof mill-owners and mill-hands?\\n\\nA consciousness of power stirred within him. He stood up. A man,--he\\nthought, stretching out his hands,--free to work, to live, to love!\\nFree! His right! He folded the scrap of paper in his hand. As his\\nnervous fingers took it in, limp and blotted, so his soul took in the\\nmean temptation, lapped it in fancied rights, in dreams of improved\\nexistences, drifting and endless as the cloud-seas of color. Clutching\\nit, as if the tightness of his hold would strengthen his sense of\\npossession, he went aimlessly down the street. It was his watch at the\\nmill. He need not go, need never go again, thank God!--shaking off the\\nthought with unspeakable loathing.\\n\\nShall I go over the history of the hours of that night? how the\\nman wandered from one to another of his old haunts, with a\\nhalf-consciousness of bidding them farewell,--lanes and alleys and\\nback-yards where the mill-hands lodged,--noting, with a new eagerness,\\nthe filth and drunkenness, the pig-pens, the ash-heaps covered with\\npotato-skins, the bloated, pimpled women at the doors,--with a new\\ndisgust, a new sense of sudden triumph, and, under all, a new, vague\\ndread, unknown before, smothered down, kept under, but still there? It\\nleft him but once during the night, when, for the second time in his\\nlife, he entered a church. It was a sombre Gothic pile, where the\\nstained light lost itself in far-retreating arches; built to meet the\\nrequirements and sympathies of a far other class than Wolfe\\'s. Yet it\\ntouched, moved him uncontrollably. The distances, the shadows, the\\nstill, marble figures, the mass of silent kneeling worshippers, the\\nmysterious music, thrilled, lifted his soul with a wonderful pain. Wolfe\\nforgot himself, forgot the new life he was going to live, the mean\\nterror gnawing underneath. The voice of the speaker strengthened the\\ncharm; it was clear, feeling, full, strong. An old man, who had lived\\nmuch, suffered much; whose brain was keenly alive, dominant; whose heart\\nwas summer-warm with charity. He taught it to-night. He held up Humanity\\nin its grand total; showed the great world-cancer to his people. Who\\ncould show it better? He was a Christian reformer; he had studied the\\nage thoroughly; his outlook at man had been free, world-wide, over all\\ntime. His faith stood sublime upon the Rock of Ages; his fiery zeal\\nguided vast schemes by which the gospel was to be preached to all\\nnations. How did he preach it to-night? In burning, light-laden words he\\npainted the incarnate Life, Love, the universal Man: words that became\\nreality in the lives of these people,--that lived again in beautiful\\nwords and actions, trifling, but heroic. Sin, as he defied it, was a\\nreal foe to them; their trials, temptations, were his. His words passed\\nfar over the furnace-tender\\'s grasp, toned to suit another class of\\nculture; they sounded in his ears a very pleasant song in an unknown\\ntongue. He meant to cure this world-cancer with a steady eye that\\nhad never glared with hunger, and a hand that neither poverty nor\\nstrychnine-whiskey had taught to shake. In this morbid, distorted heart\\nof the Welsh puddler he had failed.\\n\\nWolfe rose at last, and turned from the church down the street. He\\nlooked up; the night had come on foggy, damp; the golden mists had\\nvanished, and the sky lay dull and ash-. He wandered again\\naimlessly down the street, idly wondering what had become of the\\ncloud-sea of crimson and scarlet. The trial-day of this man\\'s life was\\nover, and he had lost the victory. What followed was mere drifting\\ncircumstance,--a quicker walking over the path,--that was all. Do you\\nwant to hear the end of it? You wish me to make a tragic story out of\\nit? Why, in the police-reports of the morning paper you can find a dozen\\nsuch tragedies: hints of ship-wrecks unlike any that ever befell on the\\nhigh seas; hints that here a power was lost to heaven,--that there a\\nsoul went down where no tide can ebb or flow. Commonplace enough the\\nhints are,--jocose sometimes, done up in rhyme.\\n\\nDoctor May, a month after the night I have told you of, was reading to\\nhis wife at breakfast from this fourth column of the morning-paper: an\\nunusual thing,--these police-reports not being, in general, choice\\nreading for ladies; but it was only one item he read.\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear! You remember that man I told you of, that we saw at\\nKirby\\'s mill?--that was arrested for robbing Mitchell? Here he is; just\\nlisten:--\\'Circuit Court. Judge Day, Hugh Wolfe, operative in Kirby &\\nJohn\\'s Loudon Mills. Charge, grand larceny. Sentence, nineteen years\\nhard labor in penitentiary.\\'--Scoundrel! Serves him right! After all\\nour kindness that night! Picking Mitchell\\'s pocket at the very time!\"\\n\\nHis wife said something about the ingratitude of that kind of people,\\nand then they began to talk of something else.\\n\\nNineteen years! How easy that was to read! What a simple word for Judge\\nDay to utter! Nineteen years! Half a lifetime!\\n\\nHugh Wolfe sat on the window-ledge of his cell, looking out. His ankles\\nwere ironed. Not usual in such cases; but he had made two desperate\\nefforts to escape. \"Well,\" as Haley, the jailer, said, \"small blame\\nto him! Nineteen years\\' imprisonment was not a pleasant thing to look\\nforward to.\" Haley was very good-natured about it, though Wolfe had\\nfought him savagely.\\n\\n\"When he was first caught,\" the jailer said afterwards, in telling the\\nstory, \"before the trial, the fellow was cut down at once,--laid there\\non that pallet like a dead man, with his hands over his eyes. Never saw\\na man so cut down in my life. Time of the trial, too, came the queerest\\ndodge of any customer I ever had. Would choose no lawyer. Judge gave him\\none, of course. Gibson it was. He tried to prove the fellow crazy; but\\nit wouldn\\'t go. Thing was plain as daylight: money found on him. \\'Twas a\\nhard sentence,--all the law allows; but it was for \\'xample\\'s sake. These\\nmill-hands are gettin\\' onbearable. When the sentence was read, he just\\nlooked up, and said the money was his by rights, and that all the world\\nhad gone wrong. That night, after the trial, a gentleman came to see him\\nhere, name of Mitchell,--him as he stole from. Talked to him for an\\nhour. Thought he came for curiosity, like. After he was gone, thought\\nWolfe was remarkable quiet, and went into his cell. Found him very low;\\nbed all bloody. Doctor said he had been bleeding at the lungs. He was as\\nweak as a cat; yet, if ye\\'ll b\\'lieve me, he tried to get a-past me and\\nget out. I just carried him like a baby, and threw him on the pallet.\\nThree days after, he tried it again: that time reached the wall. Lord\\nhelp you! he fought like a tiger,--giv\\' some terrible blows. Fightin\\'\\nfor life, you see; for he can\\'t live long, shut up in the stone crib\\ndown yonder. Got a death-cough now. \\'T took two of us to bring him down\\nthat day; so I just put the irons on his feet. There he sits, in there.\\nGoin\\' to-morrow, with a batch more of \\'em. That woman, hunchback, tried\\nwith him,--you remember?--she\\'s only got three years. \\'Complice. But\\n_she\\'s_ a woman, you know. He\\'s been quiet ever since I put on irons:\\ngiv\\' up, I suppose. Looks white, sick-lookin\\'. It acts different on \\'em,\\nbein\\' sentenced. Most of \\'em gets reckless, devilish-like. Some prays\\nawful, and sings them vile songs of the mills, all in a breath. That\\nwoman, now, she\\'s desper\\'t\\'. Been beggin\\' to see Hugh, as she calls him,\\nfor three days. I\\'m a-goin\\' to let her in. She don\\'t go with him. Here\\nshe is in this next cell. I\\'m a-goin\\' now to let her in.\"\\n\\nHe let her in. Wolfe did not see her. She crept into a corner of the\\ncell, and stood watching him. He was scratching the iron bars of the\\nwindow with a piece of tin which he had picked up, with an idle,\\nuncertain, vacant stare, just as a child or idiot would do.\\n\\n\"Tryin\\' to get out, old boy?\" laughed Haley. \"Them irons will need a\\ncrowbar beside your tin, before you can open \\'em.\"\\n\\nWolfe laughed, too, in a senseless way.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll get out,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I believe his brain\\'s touched,\" said Haley, when he came out.\\n\\nThe puddler scraped away with the tin for half an hour. Still Deborah\\ndid not speak. At last she ventured nearer, and touched his arm.\\n\\n\"Blood?\" she said, looking at some spots on his coat with a shudder.\\n\\nHe looked up at her. \"Why, Deb!\" he said, smiling,--such a bright,\\nboyish smile, that it went to poor Deborah\\'s heart directly, and she\\nsobbed and cried out loud.\\n\\n\"Oh, Hugh, lad! Hugh! dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault! To think\\nI brought hur to it! And I loved hur so! Oh, lad, I dud!\"\\n\\nThe confession, even in this wretch, came with the woman\\'s blush through\\nthe sharp cry.\\n\\nHe did not seem to hear her,--scraping away diligently at the bars with\\nthe bit of tin.\\n\\nWas he going mad? She peered closely into his face. Something she saw\\nthere made her draw suddenly back,--something which Haley had not seen,\\nthat lay beneath the pinched, vacant look it had caught since the trial,\\nor the curious gray shadow that rested on it. That gray shadow,--yes,\\nshe knew what that meant. She had often seen it creeping over women\\'s\\nfaces for months, who died at last of slow hunger or consumption. That\\nmeant death, distant, lingering: but this--Whatever it was the woman\\nsaw, or thought she saw, used as she was to crime and misery, seemed to\\nmake her sick with a new horror. Forgetting her fear of him, she caught\\nhis shoulders, and looked keenly, steadily, into his eyes.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she cried, in a desperate whisper,--\"oh, boy, not that! for\\nGod\\'s sake, not _that!_\"\\n\\nThe vacant laugh went off his face, and he answered her in a muttered\\nword or two that drove her away. Yet the words were kindly enough.\\nSitting there on his pallet, she cried silently a hopeless sort of\\ntears, but did not speak again. The man looked up furtively at her now\\nand then. Whatever his own trouble was, her distress vexed him with a\\nmomentary sting.\\n\\nIt was market-day. The narrow window of the jail looked down directly on\\nthe carts and wagons drawn up in a long line, where they had unloaded.\\nHe could see, too, and hear distinctly the clink of money as it changed\\nhands, the busy crowd of whites and blacks shoving, pushing one another,\\nand the chaffering and swearing at the stalls. Somehow, the sound, more\\nthan anything else had done, wakened him up,--made the whole real to\\nhim. He was done with the world and the business of it. He let the tin\\nfall, and looked out, pressing his face close to the rusty bars. How\\nthey crowded and pushed! And he,--he should never walk that pavement\\nagain! There came Neff Sanders, one of the feeders at the mill, with\\na basket on his arm. Sure enough, Neff was married the other week. He\\nwhistled, hoping he would look up; but he did not. He wondered if Neff\\nremembered he was there,--if any of the boys thought of him up there,\\nand thought that he never was to go down that old cinder-road again.\\nNever again! He had not quite understood it before; but now he did. Not\\nfor days or years, but never!--that was it.\\n\\nHow clear the light fell on that stall in front of the market! and how\\nlike a picture it was, the dark-green heaps of corn, and the crimson\\nbeets, and golden melons! There was another with game: how the light\\nflickered on that pheasant\\'s breast, with the purplish blood dripping\\nover the brown feathers! He could see the red shining of the drops, it\\nwas so near. In one minute he could be down there. It was just a step.\\nSo easy, as it seemed, so natural to go! Yet it could never be--not in\\nall the thousands of years to come--that he should put his foot on that\\nstreet again! He thought of himself with a sorrowful pity, as of some\\none else. There was a dog down in the market, walking after his master\\nwith such a stately, grave look!--only a dog, yet he could go backwards\\nand forwards just as he pleased: he had good luck! Why, the very vilest\\ncur, yelping there in the gutter, had not lived his life, had been free\\nto act out whatever thought God had put into his brain; while he--No, he\\nwould not think of that! He tried to put the thought away, and to listen\\nto a dispute between a countryman and a woman about some meat; but it\\nwould come back. He, what had he done to bear this?\\n\\nThen came the sudden picture of what might have been, and now. He knew\\nwhat it was to be in the penitentiary,--how it went with men there. He\\nknew how in these long years he should slowly die, but not Until soul\\nand body had become corrupt and rotten,--how, when he came out, if he\\nlived to come, even the lowest of the mill-hands would jeer him,--how\\nhis hands would be weak, and his brain senseless and stupid. He believed\\nhe was almost that now. He put his hand to his head, with a puzzled,\\nweary look. It ached, his head, with thinking. He tried to quiet\\nhimself. It was only right, perhaps; he had done wrong. But was there\\nright or wrong for such as he? What was right\\'? And who had ever taught\\nhim? He thrust the whole matter away. A dark, cold quiet crept through\\nhis brain. It was all wrong; but let it be! It was nothing to him more\\nthan the others. Let it be!\\n\\nThe door grated, as Haley opened it.\\n\\n\"Come, my woman! Must lock up for t\\'night. Come, stir yerself!\"\\n\\nShe went up and took Hugh\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Good-night, Deb,\" he said, carelessly.\\n\\nShe had not hoped he would say more; but the Sired pain on her mouth\\njust then was bitterer than death. She took his passive hand and kissed\\nit.\\n\\n\"Hur \\'ll never see Deb again!\" she ventured, her lips growing colder and\\nmore bloodless.\\n\\nWhat did she say that for? Did he not know it\\'! Yet he would not\\nimpatient with poor old Deb. She had trouble of her own, as well as he.\\n\\n\"No, never again,\" he said, trying to be cheerful.\\n\\nShe stood just a moment, looking at him. Do you laugh at her, standing\\nthere, with her hunchback, her rags, her bleared, withered face, and the\\ngreat despised love tugging at her heart?\\n\\n\"Come, you!\" called Haley, impatiently.\\n\\nShe did not move.\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" she whispered.\\n\\nIt was to be her last word. What was it?\\n\\n\"Hugh, boy, not THAT!\"\\n\\nHe did not answer. She wrung her hands, trying to be silent, looking in\\nhis face in an agony of entreaty. He smiled again, kindly.\\n\\n\"It is best, Deb. I cannot bear to be hurted any more.\"\\n\\n\"Hur knows,\" she said, humbly.\\n\\n\"Tell my father good-bye; and--and kiss little Janey.\"\\n\\nShe nodded, saying nothing, looked in his face again, and went out of\\nthe door. As she went, she staggered.\\n\\n\"Drinkin\\' to-day?\" broke out Haley, pushing her before him. \"Where the\\nDevil did you get it? Here, in with ye!\" and he shoved her into her\\ncell, next to Wolfe\\'s, and shut the door.\\n\\nAlong the wall of her cell there was a crack low down by the floor,\\nthrough which she could see the light from Wolfe\\'s. She had discovered\\nit days before. She hurried in now, and, kneeling down by it, listened,\\nhoping to hear some sound. Nothing but the rasping of the tin on the\\nbars. He was at his old amusement again. Something in the noise jarred\\non her ear, for she shivered as she heard it. Hugh rasped away at the\\nbars. A dull old bit of tin, not fit to cut korl with.\\n\\nHe looked out of the window again. People were leaving the market now.\\nA tall mulatto girl, following her mistress, her basket on her head,\\ncrossed the street just below, and looked up. She was laughing; but,\\nwhen she caught sight of the haggard face peering out through the bars,\\nsuddenly grew grave, and hurried by. A free, firm step, a clear-cut\\nolive face, with a scarlet turban tied on one side, dark, shining eyes,\\nand on the head the basket poised, filled with fruit and flowers, under\\nwhich the scarlet turban and bright eyes looked out half-shadowed. The\\npicture caught his eye. It was good to see a face like that. He would\\ntry to-morrow, and cut one like it. _To-morrow_! He threw down the tin,\\ntrembling, and covered his face with his hands. When he looked up again,\\nthe daylight was gone.\\n\\nDeborah, crouching near by on the other side of the wall, heard no\\nnoise. He sat on the side of the low pallet, thinking. Whatever was the\\nmystery which the woman had seen on his face, it came out now slowly, in\\nthe dark there, and became fixed,--a something never seen on his face\\nbefore. The evening was darkening fast. The market had been over for an\\nhour; the rumbling of the carts over the pavement grew more infrequent:\\nhe listened to each, as it passed, because he thought it was to be for\\nthe last time. For the same reason, it was, I suppose, that he strained\\nhis eyes to catch a glimpse of each passer-by, wondering who they were,\\nwhat kind of homes they were going to, if they had children,--listening\\neagerly to every chance word in the street, as if--(God be merciful to\\nthe man! what strange fancy was this?)--as if he never should hear human\\nvoices again.\\n\\nIt was quite dark at last. The street was a lonely one. The last\\npassenger, he thought, was gone. No,--there was a quick step: Joe Hill,\\nlighting the I Joe was a good old chap; never passed a fellow without\\nsome joke or other. He remembered once seeing the place where he lived\\nwith his wife. \"Granny Hill\" the boys called her. Bedridden she was; but\\nso kind as Joe was to her! kept the room so clean!--and the old woman,\\nwhen he was there, was laughing at \"some of t\\' lad\\'s foolishness.\" The\\nstep was far down the street; but he could see him place the ladder, run\\nup, and light the gas. A longing seized him to be spoken to once more.\\n\\n\"Joe!\" he called, out of the grating. \"Good-bye, Joe!\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped a moment, listening uncertainly; then hurried on.\\nThe prisoner thrust his hand out of the window, and called again,\\nlouder; but Joe was too far down the street. It was a little thing; but\\nit hurt him,--this disappointment.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, Joe!\" he called, sorrowfully enough.\\n\\n\"Be quiet!\" said one of the jailers, passing the door, striking on it\\nwith his club.\\n\\nOh, that was the last, was it?\\n\\nThere was an inexpressible bitterness on his face, as he lay down on the\\nbed, taking the bit of tin, which he had rasped to a tolerable degree\\nof sharpness, in his hand,--to play with, it may be. He bared his arms,\\nlooking intently at their corded veins and sinews. Deborah, listening in\\nthe next cell, heard a slight clicking sound, often repeated. She shut\\nher lips tightly, that she might not scream; the cold drops of sweat\\nbroke over her, in her dumb agony.\\n\\n\"Hur knows best,\" she muttered at last, fiercely clutching the boards\\nwhere she lay.\\n\\nIf she could have seen Wolfe, there was nothing about him to frighten\\nher. He lay quite still, his arms outstretched, looking at the pearly\\nstream of moonlight coming into the window. I think in that one hour\\nthat came then he lived back over all the years that had gone before.\\nI think that all the low, vile life, all his wrongs, all his starved\\nhopes, came then, and stung him with a farewell poison that made him\\nsick unto death. He made neither moan nor cry, only turned his worn face\\nnow and then to the pure light, that seemed so far off, as one that\\nsaid, \"How long, O Lord? how long?\"\\n\\nThe hour was over at last. The moon, passing over her nightly path,\\nslowly came nearer, and threw the light across his bed on his feet. He\\nwatched it steadily, as it crept up, inch by inch, slowly. It seemed to\\nhim to carry with it a great silence. He had been so hot and tired there\\nalways in the mills! The years had been so fierce and cruel! There was\\ncoming now quiet and coolness and sleep. His tense limbs relaxed, and\\nsettled in a calm languor. The blood ran fainter and slow from his\\nheart. He did not think now with a savage anger of what might be and was\\nnot; he was conscious only of deep stillness creeping over him. At first\\nhe saw a sea of faces: the mill-men,--women he had known, drunken and\\nbloated,--Janeys timid and pitiful,--poor old Debs: then they floated\\ntogether like a mist, and faded away, leaving only the clear, pearly\\nmoonlight.\\n\\nWhether, as the pure light crept up the stretched-out figure, it brought\\nwith it calm and peace, who shall say? His dumb soul was alone with\\nGod in judgment. A Voice may have spoken for it from far-off Calvary,\\n\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!\" Who dare say?\\nFainter and fainter the heart rose and fell, slower and slower the moon\\nfloated from behind a cloud, until, when at last its full tide of white\\nsplendor swept over the cell, it seemed to wrap and fold into a deeper\\nstillness the dead figure that never should move again. Silence deeper\\nthan the Night! Nothing that moved, save the black, nauseous stream of\\nblood dripping slowly from the pallet to the floor!\\n\\nThere was outcry and crowd enough in the cell the next day. The coroner\\nand his jury, the local editors, Kirby himself, and boys with their\\nhands thrust knowingly into their pockets and heads on one side, jammed\\ninto the corners. Coming and going all day. Only one woman. She came\\nlate, and outstayed them all. A Quaker, or Friend, as they call\\nthemselves. I think this woman was known by that name in heaven. A\\nhomely body, coarsely dressed in gray and white. Deborah (for Haley had\\nlet her in) took notice of her. She watched them all--sitting on the\\nend of the pallet, holding his head in her arms--with the ferocity of\\na watch-dog, if any of them touched the body. There was no meekness,\\nsorrow, in her face; the stuff out of which murderers are made, instead.\\nAll the time Haley and the woman were laying straight the limbs and\\ncleaning the cell, Deborah sat still, keenly watching the Quaker\\'s face.\\nOf all the crowd there that day, this woman alone had not spoken to\\nher,--only once or twice had put some cordial to her lips. After they\\nall were gone, the woman, in the same still, gentle way, brought a vase\\nof wood-leaves and berries, and placed it by the pallet, then opened the\\nnarrow window. The fresh air blew in, and swept the woody fragrance over\\nthe dead face. Deborah looked up with a quick wonder.\\n\\n\"Did hur know my boy wud like it? Did hur know Hugh?\"\\n\\n\"I know Hugh now.\"\\n\\nThe white fingers passed in a slow, pitiful way over the dead, worn\\nface. There was a heavy shadow in the quiet eyes.\\n\\n\"Did hur know where they\\'ll bury Hugh?\" said Deborah in a shrill tone,\\ncatching her arm.\\n\\nThis had been the question hanging on her lips all day.\\n\\n\"In t\\' town-yard? Under t\\'mud and ash? T\\'lad \\'ll smother, woman! He wur\\nborn on t\\'lane moor, where t\\'air is frick and strong. Take hur out, for\\nGod\\'s sake, take hur out where t\\'air blows!\"\\n\\nThe Quaker hesitated, but only for a moment. She put her strong arm\\naround Deborah and led her to the window.\\n\\n\"Thee sees the hills, friend, over the river? Thee sees how the\\nlight lies warm there, and the winds of God blow all the day? I live\\nthere,--where the blue smoke is, by the trees. Look at me.\" She turned\\nDeborah\\'s face to her own, clear and earnest. \"Thee will believe me? I\\nwill take Hugh and bury him there to-morrow.\"\\n\\nDeborah did not doubt her. As the evening wore on, she leaned against\\nthe iron bars, looking at the hills that rose far off, through the thick\\nsodden clouds, like a bright, unattainable calm. As she looked, a shadow\\nof their solemn repose fell on her face: its fierce discontent faded\\ninto a pitiful, humble quiet. Slow, solemn tears gathered in her eyes:\\nthe poor weak eyes turned so hopelessly to the place where Hugh was to\\nrest, the grave heights looking higher and brighter and more solemn than\\never before. The Quaker watched her keenly. She came to her at last, and\\ntouched her arm.\\n\\n\"When thee comes back,\" she said, in a low, sorrowful tone, like one\\nwho speaks from a strong heart deeply moved with remorse or pity, \"thee\\nshall begin thy life again,--there on the hills. I came too late; but\\nnot for thee,--by God\\'s help, it may be.\"\\n\\nNot too late. Three years after, the Quaker began her work. I end my\\nstory here. At evening-time it was light. There is no need to tire\\nyou with the long years of sunshine, and fresh air, and slow, patient\\nChrist-love, needed to make healthy and hopeful this impure body and\\nsoul. There is a homely pine house, on one of these hills, whose windows\\noverlook broad, wooded <DW72>s and clover-crimsoned meadows,--niched into\\nthe very place where the light is warmest, the air freest. It is the\\nFriends\\' meeting-house. Once a week they sit there, in their grave,\\nearnest way, waiting for the Spirit of Love to speak, opening their\\nsimple hearts to receive His words. There is a woman, old, deformed, who\\ntakes a humble place among them: waiting like them: in her gray dress,\\nher worn face, pure and meek, turned now and then to the sky. A woman\\nmuch loved by these silent, restful people; more silent than they, more\\nhumble, more loving. Waiting: with her eyes turned to hills higher and\\npurer than these on which she lives,--dim and far off now, but to be\\nreached some day. There may be in her heart some latent hope to meet\\nthere the love denied her here,--that she shall find him whom she lost,\\nand that then she will not be all-unworthy. Who blames her? Something\\nis lost in the passage of every soul from one eternity to the\\nother,--something pure and beautiful, which might have been and was not:\\na hope, a talent, a love, over which the soul mourns, like Esau deprived\\nof his birthright. What blame to the meek Quaker, if she took her lost\\nhope to make the hills of heaven more fair?\\n\\nNothing remains to tell that the poor Welsh puddler once lived, but this\\nfigure of the mill-woman cut in korl. I have it here in a corner of my\\nlibrary. I keep it hid behind a curtain,--it is such a rough, ungainly\\nthing. Yet there are about it touches, grand sweeps of outline, that\\nshow a master\\'s hand. Sometimes,--to-night, for instance,--the curtain is\\naccidentally drawn back, and I see a bare arm stretched out imploringly\\nin the darkness, and an eager, wolfish face watching mine: a wan, woful\\nface, through which the spirit of the dead korl-cutter looks out, with\\nits thwarted life, its mighty hunger, its unfinished work. Its pale,\\nvague lips seem to tremble with a terrible question, \"Is this the End?\"\\nthey say,--\"nothing beyond?--no more?\"\\n\\nWhy, you tell me you have seen that look in the eyes of dumb\\nbrutes,--horses dying under the lash. I know.\\n\\nThe deep of the night is passing while I write. The gas-light wakens\\nfrom the shadows here and there the objects which lie scattered through\\nthe room: only faintly, though; for they belong to the open sunlight. As\\nI glance at them, they each recall some task or pleasure of the coming\\nday. A half-moulded child\\'s head; Aphrodite; a bough of forest-leaves;\\nmusic; work; homely fragments, in which lie the secrets of all eternal\\ntruth and beauty. Prophetic all! Only this dumb, woful face seems to\\nbelong to and end with the night. I turn to look at it Has the power of\\nits desperate need commanded the darkness away? While the room is yet\\nsteeped in heavy shadow, a cool, gray light suddenly touches its head\\nlike a blessing hand, and its groping arm points through the broken\\ncloud to the far East, where, in the nickering, nebulous crimson, God\\nhas set the promise of the Dawn.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTHE REIGN OF KING COTTON.\\n\\n\\nTo every age and to all nations belong their peculiar maxims and\\npolitical or religious cries, which, if collected by some ingenious\\nphilosopher, would make a striking compendium of universal history.\\nSometimes a curious outward similarity exists between these condensed\\nnational sentences of peoples dissimilar in every other respect. Thus,\\nto-day is heard in the senescent East the oft-repeated formula of the\\nMussulman\\'s faith, \"There is no God but Allah, and Mahomet is his\\nProphet,\" while in the youthful West a new cry, as fully believed, not\\nless devout, and scarcely less often repeated, arises from one great\\nand influential portion of the political and social thinkers of this\\ncountry,--the cry that \"There is no King but Cotton, and the African is\\nits High-Priest.\" According to the creed of philosophy, philanthropy,\\nand economy in vogue among the sect whose views take utterance in this\\nformula, King Cotton has now reigned supreme over the temporal affairs\\nof the princes, potentates, and people of this earth for some thirty\\nyears. Consequently, it is fair to presume that its reign has fully\\ndeveloped its policy and tendencies and is producing its fruit for good\\nor evil, especially in the land of its disciples. It is well, therefore,\\nsometimes to withdraw a little from the dust and smoke of the battle,\\nwhich, with us at least, announces the spread of this potentate\\'s power,\\nand to try to disentangle the real questions at issue in the struggle\\nfrom the eternal complications produced by short-sighted politicians and\\npopular issues. Looking at the policy and tendency of the reign of King\\nCotton, as hitherto developed and indicated by its most confidential\\nadvisers and apostles and by the lapse of time in the so-called Slave\\nStates, to what end does it necessarily tend? to what results must it\\nlogically lead?\\n\\nWhat is coarsely, but expressively, described in the political slang of\\nthis country as \"_The Everlasting <DW65> Question_\" might perhaps fairly\\nbe considered exhausted as a topic of discussion, if ever a topic was.\\nIs it exhausted, however? Have not rather the smoke and sweat and dust\\nof the political battle in which we have been so long and so fiercely\\nengaged exercised a dimming influence on our eyes as to the true\\ndifficulty and its remedy, as they have on the vision of other angry\\ncombatants since the world began? It is easy to say, in days like these,\\nthat men seem at once to lose their judgment and reason when they\\napproach this question,--to look hardly an arm\\'s length before\\nthem,--to become mere tools of their own passions; and all this is true,\\nand, in conceding it all, no more is conceded than that the men of the\\npresent day are also mortal. How many voters in the last election,\\nbefore they went to the polls, had seriously thought out for themselves\\nthe real issue of the contest, apart from party names and platforms and\\npopular cries and passionate appeals to the conscience and the purse?\\nIn all parties, some doubtless were impelled by fanaticism,--many were\\nguided by instinct,--more by the voice of their leaders,--most by party\\ncatchwords and material interests,--but how many by real reflection and\\nthe exercise of reason? Was it every fifth man, or every tenth? Was it\\nevery fiftieth? Let every one judge for himself. The history of the\\nreigning dynasty, its policy and tendency, are still open questions, the\\ndiscussion of which, though perhaps become tedious, is not exhausted,\\nand, if conducted in a fair spirit, will at least do no harm. What,\\nthen, is all this thirty years\\' turmoil, of which the world is growing\\nsick, about? Are we indeed only fighting, as the party-leaders at the\\nNorth seem trying to persuade us, for the control, by the interests of\\nfree labor or of slave-labor, of certain remaining national territories\\ninto which probably slavery never could be made to enter?--or rather\\nis there not some deep innate principle,--some strong motive of\\naggrandizement or preservation,--some real Enceladus,--the cause of this\\nfurious volcano of destructive agitation? If, indeed, the struggle\\nbe for the possession of a sterile waste in the heart of the\\ncontinent,--useless either as a slave-breeding or a slave-working\\ncountry,--clearly, whatever the politician might say to the contrary,\\nthe patriot and the merchant would soon apply to the struggle the\\nprinciple, that sometimes the game is not worth the candle. If, however,\\nthere be an underlying principle, the case is different, and the cost of\\nthe struggle admits of no limit save the value of the motive principle.\\nHe who now pretends to discuss this question should approach it neither\\nas a Whig, a Democrat, nor a Republican, but should look at it by the\\nlight of political philosophy and economy, forgetful of the shibboleth\\nof party or appeals to passion. So far as may be, in this spirit it is\\nproposed to discuss it here.\\n\\n\"By its fruits ye shall know it.\" Look, then, for a moment, at the\\nfruits of the Cotton dynasty, as hitherto developed in the working of\\nits policy and its natural tendency,--observe its vital essence and\\nlogical necessities,--seek for the result of its workings, when brought\\nin contact with the vital spirits and life-currents of our original\\npolicy as a people,--and then decide whether this contest in which we\\nare engaged is indeed an irrepressible and inextinguishable contest,\\nor whether all this while we have not been fighting with shadows. King\\nCotton has now reigned for thirty years, be the same less or more. To\\nfeel sure that we know what its policy has wrought in that time, we must\\nfirst seek for the conditions under which it originally began its work.\\n\\nEver since Adam and Eve were forced, on their expulsion from Paradise,\\nto try the first experiment at self-government, their descendants have\\nbeen pursuing a course of homoeopathic treatment. It was the eating of\\nthe fruit of the tree of knowledge which caused all their woes; and\\nin an increased consumption of the fruit of that tree they have\\npersistently looked for alleviation of them. Experience seems to prove\\nthe wisdom of the treatment. The greater the consumption of the fruit,\\nthe greater the happiness of man. Knowledge has at last become the basis\\nof all things,--of power, of social standing, of material prosperity,\\nand, finally, in America, of government itself. Until within a century\\npast, political philosophy in the creation of government began at the\\nwrong end. It built from the pinnacle downward. The stability of the\\ngovernment depended on the apex,--the one or the few,--and not on the\\nbase,--the foundation of the many. At length, in this country, fresh\\nfrom the hand of Nature, the astonished world saw a new experiment\\ntried,--a government systematically built up from the foundation of\\nthe many,--a government drawing its being from, and dependent for its\\ncontinued existence on, the will and the intelligence of the governed.\\nThe foundation had first been laid deep and strong, and on it a goodly\\nsuperstructure of government was erected. Yet, even to this day, the\\nvery subjects of that government itself do not realize that they, and\\nnot the government, are the sources of national prosperity. In times of\\nnational emergency like the present,--amid clamors of secession and\\nof coercion,--angry threats and angrier replies,--wars and rumors of\\nwars,--what is more common than to hear sensible men--men whom the\\npeople look to as leaders--picturing forth a dire relapse into barbarism\\nand anarchy as the necessary consequence of the threatened convulsions?\\nThey forget, if they ever realized, that the people made this\\ngovernment, and not the government the people. Destroy the intelligence\\nof the people, and the government could not exist for a day;--destroy\\nthis government, and the people would create another, and yet another,\\nof no less perfect symmetry. While the foundations are firm, there need\\nbe no fears of the superstructure, which may be renewed again and again;\\nbut touch the foundations, and the superstructure must crumble at once.\\nThose who still insist on believing that this government made the people\\nare fond of triumphantly pointing to the condition of the States of\\nMexico, as telling the history of our own future, let our present\\ngovernment be once interrupted in its functions. Are Mexicans Yankees?\\nAre Spaniards Anglo-Saxons? Are Catholicism and religious freedom, the\\nInquisition and common schools, despotism and democracy, synonymous\\nterms? Could a successful republic, on our model, be at once instituted\\nin Africa on the assassination of the King of Timbuctoo? Have two\\ncenturies of education nothing to do with our success, or an eternity of\\nignorance with Mexican failure? Was our government a lucky guess, and\\ntheirs an unfortunate speculation? The one lesson that America is\\ndestined to teach the world, or to miss her destiny in failing to teach,\\nhas with us passed into a truism, and is yet continually lost sight of;\\nit is the magnificent result of three thousand years of experiment: the\\nsimple truth, that no government is so firm, so truly conservative, and\\nso wholly indestructible, as a government founded and dependent for\\nsupport upon the affections and good-will of a moral, intelligent, and\\neducated community. In our politics, we hear much of State-rights and\\ncentralization,--of distribution of power,--of checks and balances,--of\\nconstitutions and their construction,--of patronage and its\\ndistribution,--of banks, of tariffs, and of trade,--all of them subjects\\nof moment in their sphere; but their sphere is limited. Whether they be\\ndecided one way or the other is of comparatively little consequence:\\nfor, however they are decided, if the people are educated and informed,\\nthe government will go on, and the community be prosperous, be they\\ndecided never so badly,--and if decided badly, the decision will he\\nreversed; but let the people become ignorant and debased, and all the\\nchecks and balances and wise regulations which the ingenuity of man\\ncould in centuries devise would, at best, but for a short space defer\\nthe downfall of a republic. A well-founded republic can, then, be\\ndestroyed only by destroying its people,--its decay need be looked for\\nonly in the decay of their intelligence; and any form of thought or\\nany institution tending to suppress education or destroy intelligence\\nstrikes at the very essence of the government, and constitutes a treason\\nwhich no law can meet, and for which no punishment is adequate.\\n\\nEducation, then, as universally diffused as the elements of God, is the\\nlife-blood of our body politic. The intelligence of the people is the\\none great fact of our civilization and our prosperity,--it is the\\nbeating heart of our age and of our land. It is education alone which\\nmakes equality possible without anarchy, and liberty without license. It\\nis this--which makes the fundamental principles of our Declaration of\\nIndependence living realities in New England, while in France they still\\nremain the rhetorical statement of glittering generalities. From this\\nsource flow all our possibilities. Without it, the equality of man is a\\npretty figure of speech; with it, democracy is possible. This is a path\\nbeaten by two hundred years of footprints, and while we walk it we are\\nsafe and need fear no evil; but if we diverge from it, be it for never\\nso little, we stumble, and, unless we quickly retrace our steps, we fall\\nand are lost. The tutelary goddess of American liberty should be the\\npure marble image of the Professor\\'s Yankee school-mistress. Education\\nis the fundamental support of our system. It was education which made us\\nfree, progressive, and conservative; and it is education alone which can\\nkeep us so.\\n\\nWith this fact clearly established, the next inquiry should be as to\\nthe bearing and policy of the Cotton dynasty as touching this\\nquestion of general intelligence. It is a mere truism to say that the\\ncotton-culture is the cause of the present philosophical and economical\\nphase of the African question. Throughout the South, whether justly or\\nnot, it is considered as well settled that cotton can be profitably\\nraised only by a forced system of labor. This theory has been denied by\\nsome writers, and, in experience, is certainly subject to some marked\\nexceptions; but undoubtedly it is the creed of the Cotton dynasty,\\nand must here, therefore, be taken for true.[A] With this theory, the\\nSouthern States are under a direct inducement, in the nature of a bribe,\\nto the amount of the annual profit on their cotton-crop, to see as\\nmany perfections and as few imperfections as possible in the system of\\nAfrican slavery, and to follow it out unflinchingly into all its logical\\nnecessities. Thus, under the direct influence of the Cotton dynasty, the\\nwhole Southern tone on this subject has undergone a change. Slavery is\\nno longer deplored as a necessary evil, but it is maintained as in\\nall respects a substantial good. One of the logical necessities of a\\nthorough slave-system is, in at least the slave-portion of the people,\\nextreme ignorance. Whatever theoretically may be desirable in this\\nrespect among the master-class, ignorance, in its worst form,--ignorance\\nof everything except the use of the tools with which their work is to\\nbe done,--is the necessary condition of the slaves. But it is said that\\nslaves are property, without voice or influence in the government, and\\nthat the ignorance of the black is no obstacle to the intelligence\\nof the white. This possibly may be true; but a government founded on\\nignorance, as the essential condition of one portion of its people, is\\nnot likely long to regard education as its vital source and essence.\\nStill the assertion that the rule of education does not apply to slaves\\nmust be allowed; for we must deal with facts as we find them; and\\nundoubtedly the slave has no rights which the master is bound to\\nrespect; and in speaking of the policy of the Cotton dynasty, the\\nservile population must be regarded as it is, ignoring the question of\\nwhat it might be; it must be taken into consideration only as a terrible\\ninert mass of domesticated barbarism, and there left. The question\\nhere is solely with the policy and tendency of the Cotton dynasty\\nas affecting the master-class, and the servile class is in that\\nconsideration to be summarily disposed of as so much labor owned by so\\nmuch capital.\\n\\n[Footnote A: \"In truth,\" the institution of slavery, as an agency for\\ncotton-cultivation, \"is an expensive luxury, a dangerous and artificial\\nstate, and, even in a-worldly point of view, an error. The cost of a\\nfirst-class <DW64> in the United States is about L800, and the interest\\non the capital invested in and the wear and tear of this human chattel\\nare equal to 10 per cent., which, with the cost of maintaining,\\nclothing, and doctoring him, or another 5 per cent, gives an annual cost\\nof L45; and the pampered Coolies in the best paying of all the tropical\\nsettlements, Trinidad, receive wages that do not exceed on an average\\non the year round 6s. per week, or about two-fifths, while in the East\\nIndies, with perquisites, they do not receive so much as two-thirds of\\nthis. In Cuba, the Chinese emigrants do not receive so much even as\\none-third of this.\"--_Cotton Trade of Great Britain_, by J.A. MANN.\\n--In India, labor is 80 per cent cheaper than in the United States.]\\n\\nThe dynasty of Cotton is based on the monopoly of the cotton-culture in\\nthe Cotton States of the Union; its whole policy is directed to the two\\nends of making the most of and retaining that monopoly; and economically\\nit reduces everything to subserviency to the question of cotton-supply;\\n--thus Cotton is King. The result necessarily is, that the Cotton States\\nhave turned all their energies to that one branch of industry. All other\\nbranches they abandon or allow to languish. They have no commerce of\\ntheir own, few manufactories, fewer arts; and in their abandonment of\\nself in their devotion to their King, they do not even raise their\\nown hay or corn, dig their own coal, or fell their own timber; and at\\npresent, Louisiana is abandoning the sugar-culture, one of the few\\nremaining exports of the South, to share more largely in the monopoly of\\ncotton. Thus the community necessarily loses its fair proportions; it\\nceases to be self-sustaining; it exercises one faculty alone, until all\\nthe others wither and become impotent for very lack of use. This intense\\nand all-pervading devotion to one pursuit, and that a pursuit to which\\nthe existence of a servile class is declared essential, must, in a\\nrepublic more than in any other government, produce certain marked\\npolitico-philosophical and economical effects on the master-class as a\\nwhole. In a country conducted on a system of servile labor, as in one\\nconducted on free, the master-class must be divided into the two great\\norders of the rich and poor,--those who have, and those who have not.\\nThat the whole policy of the Cotton dynasty tends necessarily to making\\nbroader the chasm between these orders is most apparent. It makes the\\nrich richer, and the poor poorer; for, as, according to the creed of the\\ndynasty, capital should own labor, and the labor thus owned can alone\\nsuccessfully produce cotton, he who has must be continually increasing\\nhis store, while he who has not can neither raise the one staple\\nrecognized by the Cotton dynasty, nor turn his labor, his only property,\\nto other branches of industry; for such have, in the universal\\nabandonment of the community to cotton, been allowed to languish and\\ndie. The economical tendency of the Cotton dynasty is therefore to\\ndivide the master-class yet more distinctly into the two great opposing\\norders of society. On the one hand we see the capitalist owning the\\nlabor of a thousand slaves, and on the other the laboring white unable,\\nunder the destructive influence of a profitable monopoly, to make any\\nuse of that labor which is his only property.\\n\\nWhat influence, then, has the Cotton dynasty on that portion of the\\nmaster-class who are without capital? Its tendency has certainly\\nnecessarily been to make their labor of little value; but they are still\\ncitizens of a republic, free to come and go, and, in the eye of the law,\\nequal with the highest;--on them, in times of emergency, the government\\nmust rest; their education and intelligence are its only sure\\nfoundations. But, having made this class the vast majority of the\\nmaster-caste, what are the policy and tendency of the Cotton dynasty\\nas touching them? The story is almost too old to bear even the\\nshortest repetition. Philosophically, it is a logical necessity\\nof the Cotton dynasty that it should be opposed to universal\\nintelligence;--economically, it renders universal intelligence an\\nimpossibility. That slavery is in itself a positive good to society is\\na fundamental doctrine of the Cotton dynasty, and a proposition\\nnot necessary to be combated here; but, unfortunately, universal\\nintelligence renders free discussion a necessity, and experience tells\\nus that the suppression of free discussion is necessary to the existence\\nof slavery. We are but living history over again. The same causes have\\noften existed before, and they have drawn after them the necessary\\neffects. Other peoples, at other times, as well as our Southern brethren\\nat present, have felt, that the suppression of general discussion was\\nnecessary to the preservation of a prized and peculiar institution.\\nSpain, Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland\\nhave all, at different times, experienced the forced suppression of\\nsome one branch of political or religious thought. Their histories have\\nrecorded the effect of that suppression; and the rule to be deduced\\ntherefrom is simply this: If the people among whom such suppression is\\nattempted are ignorant, and are kept so as part of a system, the attempt\\nmay be successful, though in its results working destruction to\\nthe community;--if, however, they are intelligent, and the system\\nincautiously admits into itself any plan of education, the attempt\\nat suppression will be abandoned, as the result either of policy or\\nviolence. In this respect, then, on philosophical grounds, the Cotton\\ndynasty is not likely to favor the education of the masses. Again, it\\nis undoubtedly the interest of the man who has not, that all possible\\nbranches of industry should be open to his labor, as rendering that\\nlabor of greater value; but the whole tendency of the Cotton monopoly is\\nto blight all branches of industry in the Cotton States save only that\\none. General intelligence might lead the poor white to suspect this fact\\nof an interest of his own antagonistic to the policy of the Cotton King,\\nand therefore general intelligence is not part of that monarch\\'s policy.\\nThis the philosophers of the Cotton dynasty fairly avow and class high\\namong those dangers against which it behooves them to be on their guard.\\nThey theorize thus:--\\n\\n\"The great mass of our poor white population begin to understand that\\nthey have rights, and that they, too, are entitled to some of the\\nsympathy which falls upon the suffering. They are fast learning that\\nthere is an almost infinite world of industry opening before them, by\\nwhich they can elevate themselves and their families from wretchedness\\nand ignorance to competence and intelligence. It is this great upheaving\\nof our masses which we have to fear, so far as our institutions are\\nconcerned.\"[B]\\n\\n[Footnote B: _De Bow\\'s Review_, January, 1850. Quoted in Olmsted\\'s _Back\\nCountry_, p. 451.]\\n\\nFurther, the policy of the Cotton King, however honestly in theory it\\nmay wish to encourage it, renders general education and consequent\\nintelligence an impossibility. A system of universal education is made\\nfor a laboring population, and can be sustained only among a laboring\\npopulation; but if that population consist of slaves, universal\\neducation cannot exist. The reason is simple; for the children of all\\nmust be educated, otherwise the scholars will not support the schools.\\nIt is an absolute necessity of society that in agricultural districts\\ncultivated by slave-labor the free population should be too sparsely\\nscattered to support a system of schools, even on starvation wages for\\nthe cheapest class of teachers.\\n\\nFinally, though it is a subject not necessary now to discuss, the effect\\nof the Cotton monopoly and dynasty in depressing the majority of the\\nwhites into a species of labor competition in the same branch of\\nindustry as the blacks, because the only branch open to all, can\\nhardly have a self-respect-inspiring influence on that portion of the\\ncommunity, but should in its results rather illustrate old Falstaff\\'s\\nremark,--that \"there is a thing often heard of, and it is known to many\\nin our land, by the name of pitch; this pitch, as ancient writers do\\nreport, doth defile: so doth the company thou keepest.\"\\n\\nSuch, reason tells us, should be the effect on the intelligence and\\neducation of the free masses of the South of the policy and dynasty of\\nKing Cotton. That experience in this case verifies the conclusions\\nof reason who can doubt who has ever set foot in a thorough Slave\\nState,--or in Kansas, or in any Free State half-peopled by the poor\\nwhites of the South?--or who can doubt it, that has ever even talked on\\nthe subject with an intelligent and fair-minded Southern gentleman? Who\\nthat knows them will deny that the poor whites of the South make the\\nworst population in the country? Who ever heard a Southern gentleman\\nspeak of them, save in Congress or on the hustings, otherwise than with\\naversion and contempt?[C]\\n\\n[Footnote C: Except when used by the accomplished statistician, there is\\nnothing more fallacious than the figures of the census. As the author of\\nthis article is a disciple neither of Buckle nor De Bow, they have not\\nbeen used at all; but a few of the census figures are nevertheless\\ninstructive, as showing the difference between the Free and the Servile\\nStates in respect to popular education. According to the census of 1850,\\nthe white population of the Slave States amounted to 6,184,477 souls,\\nand the <DW52> population, free and slave, brought the total population\\nup to an aggregate of 9,612,979, of which the whole number of\\nschool-pupils was 581,861. New York, with a population of 3,097,894\\nsouls, numbered 675,221 pupils, or 98,830 more than all the Slave\\nStates. The eight Cotton States, from South Carolina to Arkansas, with\\na population of 2,137,264 whites and a grand total of 3,970,337 human\\nbeings, contained 141,032 pupils; the State of Massachusetts, with a\\ntotal population of 994,514, numbered 176,475, or 35,443 pupils more\\nthan all the Cotton States. In popular governments the great sources\\nof general intelligence are newspapers and periodicals; in estimating\\nthese, metropolitan New York should not be considered; but of these\\nthe whole number, in 1850, issued annually in all the Slave States was\\n61,038,698, and the number in the not peculiarly enlightened State of\\nPennsylvania was 84,898,672, or 3,859,974 more than in all the Slave\\nStates. In the eight Cotton States, the whole number was 30,041,991; and\\nin the single State of Massachusetts, 64,820,564, or 34,778,573 more,\\nand in the single State of Ohio, 30,473,407, or 431,416 more, than in\\nall the above eight States.]\\n\\nHere, then, we come at once to the foundation of a policy and the cause\\nof this struggle. Whether it will or no, it is the inevitable tendency\\nof the Cotton dynasty to be opposed to general intelligence. It is\\nopposed to that, then, without which a republic cannot hope to exist;\\nit is opposed to and denies the whole results of two thousand years of\\nexperience. The social system of which the government of to-day is\\nthe creature is founded on the principle of a generally diffused\\nintelligence of the people; but if now Cotton be King, as is so boldly\\nasserted, then an influence has obtained control of the government of\\nwhich the whole policy is in direct antagonism with, the very elementary\\nideas of that government. History tells us that eight bags of cotton\\nimported into England in 1784 were seized by the custom-house officers\\nat Liverpool, on the ground that so much cotton could not have been\\nproduced in these States. In 1860, the cotton-crop was estimated at\\n3,851,481 bales. Thus King Cotton was born with this government, and\\nhas strengthened with its strength; and to-day, almost the creature of\\ndestiny, sent to work the failure of our experiment as a people, it has\\nled almost one-half of the Republic to completely ignore, if not to\\nreject, the one principle absolutely essential to that Republic\\'s\\ncontinued existence. What two thousand years ago was said of Rome\\napplies to us:--\"Those abuses and corruptions which in time destroy a\\ngovernment are sown along with the very seeds of it and both grow up\\ntogether; and as rust eats away iron, and worms devour wood, and both\\nare a sort of plagues born and bred with the substance they destroy; so\\nwith every form and scheme of government that man can invent, some vice\\nor corruption creeps in with the very institution, which grows up along\\nwith and at last destroys it.\" No wonder, then, that the conflict\\nis irrepressible and hot; for two instinctive principles of\\nself-preservation have met in deadly conflict: the South, with the eager\\nloyalty of the Cavalier, rallies to the standard of King Cotton, while\\nthe North, with the earnest devotion of the Puritan, struggles hard in\\ndefence of the fundamental principles of its liberties and the ark of\\nits salvation.\\n\\nThus over nearly half of the national domain and among a large minority\\nof the citizens of the Republic, the dynasty of Cotton has worked a\\ndivergence from original principle. Wherever the sway of King Cotton\\nextends, the people have for the present lost sight of the most\\nessential of our national attributes. They are seeking to found a great\\nand prosperous republic on the cultivation of a single staple product,\\nand not on intelligence universally diffused: consequently they\\nhave founded their house upon the sand. Among them, cotton, and\\nnot knowledge, is power. When thus reduced to its logical\\nnecessities,--brought down, as it were, to the hard pan,--the experience\\nof two thousand years convincingly proves that their experiment as a\\ndemocracy must fail. It is, then, a question of vital importance to\\nthe whole people,--How can this divergence be terminated? Is there any\\nresult, any agency, which can destroy this dynasty, and restore us as a\\npeople to the firm foundations upon which our experiment was begun? Can\\nthe present agitation effect this result? If it could, the country might\\njoyfully bid a long farewell to \"the canker of peace,\" and \"hail the\\nblood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire\"; but the sad answer, that\\nit cannot, whether resulting in the successor Democrat or Republican,\\nseems almost too evident for discussion. The present conflict is good so\\nfar as it goes, but it touches only the surface of things. It is well to\\ndrive the Cotton dynasty from the control of the national government;\\nbut the aims of the Republican party can reach no farther, even if it\\nmeet with complete success in that. But even that much is doubtful. The\\ndanger at this point is one ever recurring. Those Northern politicians,\\nwho, in pursuit of their political objects and ambition, unreservedly\\nbind up their destinies with those of the Cotton dynasty,--the Issachars\\nof the North, whose strong backs are bowed to receive any burden,--the\\nmen who in the present conflict will see nought but the result of the\\nmaudlin sentimentality of fanatics and the empty cries of ambitious\\ndemagogues,--are not mistaken in their calculations. While Cotton is\\nKing, as it now is, nothing but time or its own insanity can permanently\\nshake its hold on the national policy. In moments of fierce convulsion,\\nas at present, the North, like a restive steed, may contest its\\nsupremacy. Let the South, however, bend, not break, before the storm,\\nand history is indeed \"a nurse\\'s tale,\" if the final victory does not\\nrest with the party of unity and discipline. While the monopoly of\\ncotton exists with the South, and it is cultivated exclusively by native\\nAfrican labor, the national government will as surely tend, in spite of\\nall momentarily disturbing influences, towards a united South as the\\nneedle to the pole. But even if the government were permanently wrested\\nfrom its control, would the evil be remedied? Surely not. The disease\\nwhich is sapping the foundations of our liberty is not eradicated\\nbecause its workings are forced inward. What remedy is that which leaves\\na false and pernicious policy--a policy in avowed war with the whole\\nspirit of our civilization and in open hostility to our whole experiment\\nas a government--in full working, almost a religious creed with near\\none-half of our people? As a remedy, this would be but a quack medicine\\nat the best. The cure must be a more thorough one. The remedy we must\\nlook for--the only one which can meet the exigencies of the case--must\\nbe one which will restore to the South the attributes of a democracy. It\\nmust cause our Southern brethren of their own free will to reverse their\\nsteps,--to return from their divergence. It must teach them a purer\\nChristianity, a truer philosophy, a sounder economy. It must lead them\\nto new paths of industry. It must gently persuade them that a true\\nnational prosperity is not the result of a total abandonment of\\nthe community to the culture of one staple. It must make them\\nself-dependent, so that no longer they shall have to import their\\ncorn from the Northwest, their lumber-men and hay from Maine, their\\nmanufactures from Massachusetts, their minerals from Pennsylvania, and\\nto employ the shipping of the world. Finally, it must make it impossible\\nfor one overgrown interest to plunge the whole community unresistingly\\ninto frantic rebellion or needless war. They must learn that a\\nwell-conditioned state is, so far as may be, perfect in itself,--and,\\nto be perfect in itself, must be intelligent and free. When these\\nlessons are taught to the South, then will their divergence cease,\\nand they will enter upon a new path of enjoyment, prosperity, and\\npermanence. The world at present pays them an annual bribe of some\\n$65,000,000 to learn none of these lessons. Their material interest\\nteaches them to bow down to the shrine of King Cotton. Here, then, lies\\nthe remedy with the disease. The prosperity of the country in general,\\nand of the South in particular, demands that the reign of King Cotton\\nshould cease,--that his dynasty should be destroyed. This result can\\nbe obtained but in one way, and that seemingly ruinous. The present\\nmonopoly in their great staple commodity enjoyed by the South must be\\ndestroyed, and forever. This result every patriot and well-wisher of the\\nSouth should ever long for; and yet, by every Southern statesman and\\nphilosopher, it is regarded as the one irremediable evil possible to\\ntheir country. What miserable economy! what feeble foresight! What\\nprinciple of political economy is better established than that a\\nmonopoly is a curse to both producer and consumer? To the first it pays\\na premium on fraud, sloth, and negligence; and to the second it supplies\\nthe worst possible article, in the worst possible way, at the highest\\npossible price. In agriculture, in manufactures, in the professions, and\\nin the arts, it is the greatest bar to improvement with which any branch\\nof industry can be cursed. The South is now showing to the world an\\nexample of a great people borne down, crushed to the ground, cursed, by\\na monopoly. A fertile country of magnificent resources, inhabited by a\\ngreat race, of inexhaustible energy, is abandoned to one pursuit;--the\\nvery riches of their position are as a pestilence to their prosperity.\\nIn the presence of their great monopoly, science, art, manufactures,\\nmining, agriculture,--word, all the myriad branches of industry\\nessential to the true prosperity of a state,--wither and die, that\\nsanded cotton may be produced by the most costly of labor. For love of\\ncotton, the very intelligence of the community, the life-blood of their\\npolity, is disregarded and forgotten. Hence it is that the marble and\\nfreestone quarries of New England alone are far more important sources\\nof revenue than all the subterranean deposits of the Servile States.\\nThus the monopoly which is the apparent source of their wealth is in\\nreality their greatest curse; for it blinds them to the fact, that, with\\nnations as with individuals, a healthy competition is the one essential\\nto all true economy and real excellence. Monopolists are always blind,\\nalways practise a false economy. Adam Smith tells us that \"it is not\\nmore than fifty years ago that some of the counties in the neighborhood\\nof London petitioned the Parliament against the extension of the\\nturnpike roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they\\npretended, from the cheapness of labor, would be able to sell their\\ngrass and corn cheaper in the London market than themselves, and would\\nthereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation.\" The great\\neconomist significantly adds,--\"Their rents, however, have risen, and\\ntheir cultivation has been improved, since that time.\" Finally, to-day,\\nwould the cultivation of cereals in the Northwest be improved, if made\\na monopoly? would its inhabitants be richer? would their economy be\\nbetter? Certainly not. Yet to-day they undersell the world, and, in\\nspite of competition, are far richer, far more contented and prosperous,\\nthan their fellow-citizens in the South in the full enjoyment of their\\nboasted dynasty of Cotton.\\n\\n\"Here,\" said Wellington, on the Eton football ground, \"we won the battle\\nof Waterloo.\" Not in angry declamation and wordy debate, in threats of\\nsecession and cries for coercion, amid the clash of party-politics, the\\nwindy declamation of blatant politicians, or the dirty scramble for\\noffice, is the destruction of the dynasty of King Cotton to be looked\\nfor. The laws of trade must be the great teacher; and here, as\\nelsewhere, England, the noble nation of shopkeepers, must be the agent\\nfor the fulfilment of those laws. It is safe to-day to say, that,\\nthrough the agency of England, and, in accordance with those laws, under\\na continuance of the present profit on that staple, the dynasty of King\\nCotton is doomed,--the monopoly which is now the basis of his power will\\nbe a monopoly no more. If saved at all from the blight of this\\nmonopoly, the South will be saved, not in New York or Boston, but in\\nLiverpool,--not by the thinkers of America, but by the merchants of\\nEngland. The real danger of the Cotton dynasty lies not in the hostility\\nof the North, but in the exigencies of the market abroad; they struggle\\nnot against the varying fortunes of political warfare, but against the\\nirreversible decrees of Fate. It is the old story of the Rutulian hero;\\nand now, in the very crisis and agony of the battle, while the Cotton\\nKing is summoning all his resources and straining every nerve to cope\\nsuccessfully with its more apparent, but less formidable adversary, in\\nthe noisy struggle for temporary power, if it would listen for a moment\\nto the voice of reason, and observe the still working of the laws of our\\nbeing, it, too, might see cause to abandon the contest, with the\\nangry lament, that, not by its opponent was it vanquished, but by the\\nhostility of Jupiter and the gods. The operation of the laws of\\ntrade, as touching this monopoly, is beautifully simple. Already the\\nindications are sufficient to tell us, that, under the sure, but\\nsilent working of those laws, the very profits of the Southern planter\\nforeshadow the destruction of his monopoly. His dynasty rests upon the\\ntheory, that his <DW64> is the only practical agency for the production\\nof his staple. But the supply of African labor is limited, and the\\nincreased profit on cotton renders the cost of that labor heavier in\\nits turn,--the value of the <DW64> rising one hundred dollars for every\\nadditional cent of profit on a pound of cotton. The increased cost of\\nthe labor increases the cost of producing the cotton. The result is\\nclear; and the history of the cotton-trade has twice verified it. The\\nincreased profits on the staple tempt competition, and, in the increased\\ncost of production, render it possible. Two courses only are open to the\\nSouth: either to submit to the destruction of their monopoly, or to try\\nto retain it by a cheaper supply of labor. They now feel the pressure of\\nthe dilemma; and hence the cry to reopen the slave-trade. According to\\nthe iron policy of their dynasty, they must inundate their country with\\nfreshly imported barbarism, or compete with the world. They cry out for\\nmore Africans; and to their cry the voice of the civilized world returns\\nits veto. The policy of King Cotton forces them to turn from the\\ndaylight of free labor now breaking in Texas. On the other hand, it is\\nnot credible that all the land adapted to the growth of the cotton-plant\\nis confined to America; and, at the present value of the commodity, the\\nland adapted to its growth would be sought out and used, though buried\\nnow in the jungles of India, the wellnigh impenetrable wildernesses of\\nAfrica, the table-lands of South America, or the islands of the Pacific.\\nAlready the organized energy of England has pushed its explorations,\\nunder Livingstone, Barth, and Clegg, into regions hitherto unknown.\\nAlready, under the increased consumption, one-third of the cotton\\nconsumed at Liverpool is the product of climes other than our own.\\nHundreds of miles of railroad in India are opening to the market vast\\nregions to share in our profits and break down our monopoly. To-day,\\nIndia, for home-consumption and exportation, produces twice the amount\\nof cotton produced in America; and, under the increased profit of late\\nyears, the importation into England from that country has risen from\\n12,324,200 pounds in 1830, to 77,011,839 pounds in 1840, and, finally,\\nto 250,338,144 pounds in 1857, or nearly twenty per cent of the whole\\namount imported, and more than one-fourth of the whole amount imported\\nfrom America. The staple there produced does not, indeed, compare in\\nquality with our own; but this remark does not apply to the staple\\nproduced in Africa,--the original home of the cotton-plant, as of the\\n<DW64>,--or to that of the cotton-producing islands of the Pacific. The\\ninexhaustible fertility of the valley of the Nile--producing, with a\\nsingle exception, the finest cotton of the world,--lying on the same\\nlatitude as the cotton-producing States of America, and overflowing\\nwith unemployed labor--will find its profit, at present prices, in the\\nabandonment of the cultivation of corn, its staple product since the\\ndays of Joseph, to come in competition with the monopoly of the South.\\nPeru, Australia, Cuba, Jamaica, and even the Feejee Islands, all are\\npreparing to enter the lists. And, finally, the interior of Africa, the\\ngreat unknown and unexplored land, which for centuries has baffled the\\nenterprise of travellers, seems about to make known her secrets under\\nthe persuasive arguments of trade, and to make her cotton, and not her\\nchildren, her staple export in the future. In the last fact is to be\\nseen a poetic justice. Africa, outraged, scorned, down-trodden, is,\\nperhaps, to drag down forever the great enslaver of her offspring.\\n\\nThus the monopoly of King Cotton hangs upon a thread. Its profits must\\nfall, or it must cease to exist. If subject to no disturbing influence,\\nsuch as war, which would force the world to look elsewhere for its\\nsupply, and thus unnaturally force production elsewhere, the growth of\\nthis competition will probably be slow. Another War of 1812, or any\\nlong-continued civil convulsions, would force England to look to other\\nsources of supply, and, thus forcing production, would probably be the\\ndeath-blow of the monopoly. Apart from all disturbing influences arising\\nfrom the rashness of his own lieges, or other causes, the reign of King\\nCotton at present prices may be expected to continue some ten years\\nlonger. For so long, then, this disturbing influence may be looked for\\nin American politics; and then we may hope that this tremendous material\\ninfluence, become subject, like others, to the laws of trade and\\ncompetition, will cease to threaten our liberties by silently sapping\\ntheir very foundation. As in the course of years competition gradually\\nincreases, the effect of this competition on the South will probably be\\nmost beneficial. The change from monopoly to competition, distributed\\nover many years, will come with no sudden and destructive shock, but\\nwill take place imperceptibly. The fall of the dynasty will be gradual;\\nand with the dynasty must fall its policy. Its fruits must be eradicated\\nby time. Under the healing influence of time, the South, still young and\\nenergetic, ceasing to think of one thing alone, will quickly turn its\\nattention to many. Education will be more sought for, as the policy\\nwhich resisted it, and made its diffusion impossible, ceases to exist.\\nWith the growth of other branches of industry, labor will become\\nrespectable and profitable, and laborers will flock to the country; and\\na new, a purer, and more prosperous future will open upon the entire\\nRepublic. Perhaps, also, it may in time be discovered that even\\nslave-labor is most profitable when most intelligent and best\\nrewarded,--that the present mode of growing cotton is the most wasteful\\nand extravagant, and one not bearing competition. Thus even the African\\nmay reap benefit from the result, and in his increased self-respect and\\nintelligence may be found the real prosperity of the master. And thus\\nthe peaceful laws of trade may do the work which agitation has attempted\\nin vain. Sweet concord may come from this dark chaos, and the world\\nreceive another proof, that material interest, well understood, is\\nnot in conflict, but in beautiful unison with general morality,\\nall-pervading intelligence, and the precepts of Christianity. Under\\nthese influences, too, the very supply of cotton will probably be\\nimmensely increased. Its cultivation, like the cultivation of their\\nstaple products by the English counties mentioned by Smith, will\\nnot languish, but flourish, under the influence of healthy\\ncompetition.--These views, though simply the apparently legitimate\\nresult of principle and experience, are by no means unsupported by\\nauthority. They are the same results arrived at from the reflections of\\nthe most unprejudiced of observers. A shrewd Northern gentleman, who has\\nmore recently and thoroughly than any other writer travelled through the\\nSouthern States, in the final summary of his observations thus covers\\nall the positions here taken. \"My conclusion,\" says Mr. Olmsted, \"is\\nthis,--that there is no physical obstacle in the way of our country\\'s\\nsupplying ten bales of cotton where it now does one. All that is\\nnecessary for this purpose is to direct to the cotton-producing region\\nan adequate number of laborers, either black or white, or both. No\\namalgamation, no association on equality, no violent disruption of\\npresent relations is necessary. It is necessary that there should\\nbe more objects of industry, more varied enterprises, more general\\nintelligence among the people,--and, especially, that they should\\nbecome, or should desire to become, richer, more comfortable, than they\\nare.\"\\n\\nIt is not pleasant to turn from this, and view the reverse of the\\npicture. But, unless our Southern brethren, in obedience to some great\\nlaw of trade or morals, return from their divergence,--if, still being\\na republic in form, the South close her ears to the great truth, that\\neducation is democracy\\'s first law of self-preservation,--if the dynasty\\nof King Cotton, unshaken by present indications, should continue\\nindefinitely, and still the South should bow itself down as now before\\nits throne,--it requires no gift of prophecy to read her future. As you\\nsow, so shall you reap; and communities, like individuals, who sow the\\nwind, must, in the fulness of time, look to reap the whirlwind. The\\nConstitution of our Federal Union guaranties to each member composing it\\na republican form of government; but no constitution can guaranty that\\nuniversal intelligence of the people without which, soon or late, a\\nrepublican government must become, not only a form, but a mockery. Under\\nthe Cotton dynasty, the South has undoubtedly lost sight of this great\\nprinciple; and unless she return and bind herself closely to it, her\\nfate is fixed. Under the present monopolizing sway of King Cotton,--soon\\nor late, in the Union, or out of the Union,--her government must\\ncease to be republican, and relapse into anarchy, unless previously,\\nabandoning the experiment of democracy in despair, she take refuge in a\\ngovernment of force. The Northern States, the educational communities,\\nhave apparently little to fear while they cling closely to the\\nprinciples inherent in their nature. With the Servile States, or away\\nfrom them, the experiment of a constitutional republic can apparently be\\ncarried on with success through an indefinite lapse of time; but\\nthough, with the assistance of an original impetus and custom, they\\nmay temporarily drag along their stumbling brethren of the South, the\\ncatastrophe is but deferred, not avoided. Out of the Union, the more\\nextreme Southern States--those in which King Cotton has already firmly\\nestablished his dynasty--are, if we may judge by passing events, ripe\\nfor the result. The more Northern have yet a reprieve of fate, as having\\nnot yet wholly forgotten the lessons of their origin. The result,\\nhowever, be it delayed for one year or for one hundred years, can hardly\\nadmit of doubt. The emergency which is to try their system may not arise\\nfor many years; but passing events warn us that it maybe upon them now.\\nThe most philosophical of modern French historians, in describing the\\nlatter days of the Roman Empire, tells us that \"the higher classes of\\na nation can communicate virtue and wisdom to the government, if they\\nthemselves are virtuous and wise: but they can never give it strength;\\nfor strength always comes from below; it always proceeds from the\\nmasses.\" The Cotton dynasty pretends not only to maintain a government\\nwhere the masses are slaves, but a republican government where the vast\\nmajority of the higher classes are ignorant. On the intelligence of the\\nmass of the whites the South must rely for its republican permanence, as\\non their arms it must rely for its force; and here again, the words of\\nSismondi, written of falling Rome, seem already applicable to the South:\\n--\"Thus all that class of free cultivators, who more than any other\\nclass feel the love of country, who could defend the soil, and who ought\\nto furnish the best soldiers, disappeared almost entirely. The number\\nof small farmers diminished to such a degree, that a rich man, a man of\\nnoble family, had often to travel more than ten leagues before falling\\nin with an equal or a neighbor.\" The destruction of the republican form\\nof government is, then, almost the necessary catastrophe; but what will\\nfollow that catastrophe it is not so easy to foretell. The Republic,\\nthus undermined, will fall; but what shall supply its place? The\\ntendency of decaying republics is to anarchy; and men take refuge from\\nthe terrors of anarchy in despotism. The South least of all can indulge\\nin anarchy, as it would at once tend to servile insurrection. They\\ncannot long be torn by civil war, for the same reason. The ever-present,\\nall-pervading fear of the African must force them into some government,\\nand the stronger the better. The social divisions of the South, into the\\nrich and educated whites, the poor and ignorant whites, and the\\nservile class, would seem naturally to point to an aristocratic or\\nconstitutional-monarchical form of government. But, in their transition\\nstate, difficulties are to be met in all directions; and the\\nwell-ordered social distinctions of a constitutional monarchy seem\\nhardly consistent with the time-honored licentious independence and\\nrude equality of Southern society. The reign of King Cotton, however,\\nconducted under the present policy, must inevitably tend to increase and\\naggravate all the present social tendencies of the Southern system,--\\nall the anti-republican affinities already strongly developed. It makes\\ndeeper the chasm dividing the rich and the poor; it increases vastly the\\nranks of the uneducated; and, finally, while most unnaturally forcing\\nthe increase of the already threatening African infusion, it also tends\\nto make the servile condition more unendurable, and its burdens heavier.\\n\\nThe modern Southern politician is the least far-seeing of all our\\nshort-sighted classes of American statesmen. In the existence of a\\nnation, a generation should be considered but as a year in the life of\\nman, and a century but as a generation of citizens. Soon or late, in the\\nlives of this generation or of their descendants, in the Union or out\\nof the Union, the servile members of this Confederacy must, under the\\nresults of the prolonged dynasty of Cotton, make their election either\\nto purchase their security, like Cuba, by dependence on the strong arm\\nof external force, or they must meet national exigencies, pass through\\nrevolutions, and destroy and reconstruct governments, making every\\nmovement on the surface of a seething, heaving volcano. All movements of\\nthe present, looking only to the forms of government of the master, must\\nbe carried on before the face of the slave, and the question of class\\nwill ever be complicated by that of caste. What the result of the\\never-increasing tendencies of the Cotton dynasty will be it is therefore\\nimpossible to more than dream. But is it fair to presume that the\\nimmense servile population should thus see upturnings and revolutions,\\ndynasties rising and falling before their eyes, and ever remain quiet\\nand contented? \"Nothing,\" said Jefferson, \"is more surely written in the\\nBook of Fate than that this people must be free.\" Fit for freedom at\\npresent they are not, and, under the existing policy of the Cotton\\ndynasty, never can be. \"Whether under any circumstances they could\\nbecome so is not here a subject of discussion; but, surely, the day will\\ncome when the white caste will wish the experiment had been tried. The\\nargument of the Cotton King against the alleviation of the condition of\\nthe African is, that his nature does not admit of his enjoyment of true\\nfreedom consistently with the security of the community, and therefore\\nhe must have none. But certainly his school has been of the worst. Would\\nnot, perhaps, the reflections applied to the case of the French peasants\\nof a century ago apply also to them?\" It is not under oppression that\\nwe learn how to use freedom. The ordinary sophism by which misrule is\\ndefended is, when truly stilted, this: The people must continue in\\nslavery, because slavery has generated in them all the vices of slaves;\\nbecause they are ignorant, they must remain under a power which has made\\nand which keeps them ignorant; because they have been made ferocious by\\nmisgovernment, they must be misgoverned forever. If the system under\\nwhich they live were so mild and liberal that under its operation they\\nhad become humane and enlightened, it would be safe to venture on a\\nchange; but, as this system has destroyed morality, and prevented the\\ndevelopment of the intellect,--as it has turned men, who might, under\\ndifferent training, have formed a virtuous and happy community, into\\nsavage and stupid wild beasts, therefore it ought to last forever.\\nPerhaps the counsellors of King Cotton think that in this case it will;\\nbut all history teaches us another lesson. If there be one spark of love\\nfor freedom in the nature of the African,--whether it be a love common\\nto him with the man or the beast, the Caucasian or the chimpanzee,--the\\nlove of freedom as affording a means of improvement or an opportunity\\nfor sloth,--the policy of King Cotton will cause it to work its way out.\\nIt is impossible to say how long it will be in so doing, or what weight\\nthe broad back of the African will first be made to bear; but, if the\\nspirit exist, some day it must out. This lesson is taught us by the\\nwhole recorded history of the world. Moses leading the Children of\\nIsrael up out of Egypt,--Spartacus at the gates of Rome,--the Jacquerie\\nin France,--Jack Cade and Wat Tyler in England,--Nana Sahib and the\\nSepoys in India,--Toussaint l\\'Ouverture and the Haytiens,--and, finally,\\nthe insurrection of Nat Turner in this country, with those in Guiana,\\nJamaica, and St. Lucia: such examples, running through all history,\\npoint the same moral. This last result of the Cotton dynasty may come at\\nany moment after the time shall once have arrived when, throughout any\\ngreat tract of country, the suppressing force shall temporarily, with\\nall the advantages of mastership, including intelligence and weapons, be\\nunequal to coping with the force suppressed. That time may still be far\\noff. Whether it be or not depends upon questions of government and\\nthe events of the chapter of accidents. If the Union should now be\\ndissolved, and civil convulsions should follow, it may soon be upon us.\\nBut the superimposed force is yet too great under any circumstances, and\\nthe convulsion would probably be but temporary. At present, too, the\\nvalue of the slave insures him tolerable treatment; but, as numbers\\nincrease, this value must diminish. Southern statesmen now assert that\\nin thirty years there will be twelve million slaves in the South; and\\nthen, with increased numbers, why should not the philosophy of the\\nsugar-plantation prevail, and it become part of the economy of the\\nCotton creed, that it is cheaper to work slaves to death and purchase\\nfresh ones than to preserve their usefulness by moderate employment?\\nThen the value of the slave will no longer protect him, and then the\\nend will be nigh. Is this thirty or fifty years off? Perhaps not for\\na century hence will the policy of King Cotton work its legitimate\\nresults, and the volcano at length come to its head and defy all\\ncompression.\\n\\nIn one of the stories of the \"Arabian Nights\" we are told of an Afrite\\nconfined by King Solomon in a brazen vessel; and the Sultana tells\\nus, that, during the first century of his confinement, he said in his\\nheart,--\"I will enrich whosoever will liberate me\"; but no one liberated\\nhim. In the second century he said,--\"Whosoever will liberate me, I will\\nopen to him the treasures of the earth\"; but no one liberated him. And\\nfour centuries more passed, and he said,--\"Whosoever shall liberate me,\\nI will fulfil for him three wishes\"; but still no one liberated him.\\nThen despair at his long bondage took possession of his soul, and, in\\nthe eighth century, he swore,--\"Whosoever shall liberate me, him will\\nI surely slay!\" Let the Southern statesmen look to it well that the\\nbreaking of the seal which confines our Afrite be not deferred till long\\nbondage has turned his heart, like the heart of the Spirit in the fable,\\ninto gall and wormwood; lest, if the breaking of that seal be deferred\\nto the eighth or even the sixth century, it result to our descendants\\nlike the breaking of the sixth seal of Revelation,--\"And, lo! there was\\na great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and\\nthe moon became as blood, and the heaven departed as a scroll, when it\\nis rolled together; and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and\\nthe rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every free\\nman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, and\\nsaid to the mountains and rocks, \\'Fall on us and hide us, for the great\\nday of wrath is come\\'\" On that day, at least, will end the reign of King\\nCotton.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nGLIMPSES OF GARIBALDI.\\n\\n\\nFIRST GLIMPSE.\\n\\n\\nIt is a sultry morning in October, and we are steaming in a small\\nSardinian boat from Leghorn towards Naples. This city has fallen into\\nthe power of Garibaldi, who is concentrating his forces before Capua,\\nwhile the King of Sardinia bears down with a goodly army from the North.\\n\\nThe first object of special interest which comes into view, after we\\npass the island of Elba, is Gaeta. Though care is taken not to run near\\nenough to invite a chase from the Neapolitan frigates, we are yet able\\nto obtain a distinct view of the last stronghold--the jumping-off place,\\nas we hope it will prove--of Francis II. The white walls of the fortress\\nrise grimly out of the sea, touching the land only upon one side, and\\nlooking as though they might task well the resources of modern warfare\\nto reduce them. We soon make out the smoke of four or five steamers,\\nwhich we suppose to be armed vessels, heading towards Gaeta.\\n\\nAbout two o\\'clock we glide into the far-famed Bay of Naples, in company\\nwith the cool sea-breeze which there each afternoon sends to refresh\\nthe heated shore. As we swing round to our moorings, we pass numerous\\nline-of-battle-ships and frigates bearing the flags of England,\\nFrance, and Sardinia, but look in vain and with disappointment for the\\nstar-spangled banner. A single floating representative of American\\nnationality is obliged to divide the favor of her presence between the\\nports of both the Two Sicilies, and at this time she is at the island\\nportion of the kingdom.\\n\\nOur craft is at once beset by boats, their owners pushing, vociferating,\\nand chaffering for fares, as though Mammon, and not Moloch, were the\\nruling spirit. Together with a chance companion of the voyage, Signor\\nAlvigini, _Intendente_ of Genoa, and his party, we are soon in the hands\\nof the _commissionnaire_ of the Hotel de Rome. As we land, our passports\\nare received by the police of Victor Emmanuel, who have replaced those\\nof the late _regime_.\\n\\nAs we enter our carriage, we expect to see streets filled with crowds of\\nturbulent people, or dotted with knots of persons conversing ominously\\nin suppressed tones; and streets deserted, with shops closed; and\\nstreets barricaded. But in this matter we are agreeably disappointed.\\nThe shops are all open, the street venders are quietly tending their\\ntables, people go about their ordinary affairs, and wear their\\ncommonplace, every-day look. The only difference apparent to the eye\\nbetween the existing state of things and that which formerly obtained\\nis, that there are few street brawls and robberies, though every one\\ngoes armed,--that the uniform of the soldiers of Francis II. is replaced\\nby the dark gray dress of the National Guard,--and that the Hag of\\nthe Tyrant King no longer waves over the castle-prison of Sant\\' Elmo.\\nGaribaldi, on leaving Naples, had formally confided the city to the\\nNational Guard; and they had nobly sustained the trust reposed in them.\\n\\nA letter of introduction to General Orsini, brought safely with us,\\nthough not without adventure, through the Austrian dominions, gains\\na courteous reception from General Turr, chief aide-de-camp to the\\n\"Dictator,\" and a pass to the camp. General Turr, an Hungarian refugee,\\nis a person of distinguished appearance, not a little heightened by\\nhis peculiar dress, which consists of the usual Garibaldian uniform\\npartially covered with a white military cloak, which hangs gracefully\\nover his elegant figure.\\n\\nAfter a brief, but pleasant, interview with this gentleman, we climb to\\nthe Castle of Sant\\' Elmo, built on a high eminence commanding the town,\\nand with its guns mounted, not so as to defend it against an invading\\nenemy, but to hurl destruction on the devoted subjects of the Bourbon.\\nWe are told that the people Lad set their hearts on seeing this\\nfortress, which they look upon as a standing menace, razed to the\\nground, and its site covered with peaceful dwellings. And it is not\\nwithout regret that we have since learned that Victor Emmanuel has\\nthought it inexpedient to comply with this wish. Nor, in our ignorance,\\ncan we divest ourselves entirely of the belief that it would have been a\\nwise as well as conciliatory policy to do so.\\n\\nWe are politely shown over the castle by one of the National Guard, who\\nhold it in charge, and see lounging upon one of its terraces, carefully\\nguarded, but kindly allowed all practicable liberty, several officers of\\nthe late power, prisoners where they had formerly held despotic sway. We\\ndescend into the now empty dungeons, dark and noisome as they have been\\ndescribed, where victims of political accusation or suspicion have pined\\nfor years in dreary solitude. It produces a marked sensation in the\\nminds of our Italian companions in this sad tour of inspection, when\\nwe tell them, through our guide Antonio, that these cells are the\\ncounterpart of the dungeons of the condemned in the prison of the Doges\\nof Venice, as we had seen them a few days before,--save that the latter\\nwere better, in their day, in so far as in them the cold stone was\\noriginally lined and concealed by wooden casings, while in those before\\nus the helpless prisoner in his gropings could touch only the hard rock,\\nsignificant of the relentless despotism which enchained him. The walls\\nare covered with the inscriptions of former tenants. In One place we\\ndiscover a long line of marks in groups of fives,--like the tallies of\\nour boyish sports,--but here used for how different a purpose! Were\\nthese the records of days, or weeks, or months? The only furniture of\\nthe cells is a raised platform of wood, the sole bed of the miserable\\ninmate. The Italian visitors, before leaving, childishly vent their\\nuseless rage at the sight of these places of confinement, by breaking to\\npieces the windows and shutters, and scattering their fragments on the\\nfloor.\\n\\nWe have returned from Sant\\' Elmo, and, evening having arrived, are\\nsitting in the smoking-room of the Hotel de Grande Bretagne, conversing\\nwith one of the English Volunteers, when our friend General J--n of the\\nBritish Army, one of the lookers-on in Naples, comes in, having just\\nreturned from \"the front.\" He brings the news of a smart skirmish which\\nhas taken place during the day; of the English \"Excursionists\" being\\nordered out in advance; of their rushing with alacrity into the thickest\\nof the fight, and bravely sustaining the conflict,--being, indeed,\\nwith difficulty withheld by their officers from needlessly exposing\\nthemselves. But this inspiring news is tinged with sadness. One of their\\nnumber, well known and much beloved, had fallen, killed instantly by a\\nbullet through the head. Military ardor, aroused by the report of\\nbrave deeds, is for a few moments held in abeyance by grief, and\\nthen rekindled by the desire of vengeance. Hot blood is up, and the\\nprevailing feeling is a longing for a renewal of the fight. We are told,\\nif we wish to see an action, to go to \"the front\" to-morrow. Accordingly\\nwe decide to be there.\\n\\nThe following day, our faithful _commissionnaire_, Antonio, places us\\nin a carriage drawn by a powerful pair of horses, and headed for the\\nGaribaldian camp. A hamper of provisions is not forgotten, and before\\nstarting we cause Antonio to double the supplies: we have a presentiment\\nthat we may find with whom to share them.\\n\\nThere are twelve miles before us to the nearest point in the camp, which\\nis Caserta. Our chief object being to see the hero of Italy, if we do\\nnot find him at Caserta, we shall push on four miles farther, to Santa\\nMaria; and, missing him there, ride still another four miles to Sant\\'\\nAngelo, where rests the extreme right of the army over against Capua.\\n\\nAs we ride over the broad and level road from Naples to Caserta,\\nbordered with lines of trees through its entire length, we are surprised\\nto see not only husbandmen quietly tilling the fields, but laborers\\nengaged in public works upon the highway, as if in the employ of a long\\nestablished authority, and making it difficult to believe that we are\\nin the midst of civil war, and under a provisional government of a few\\nweeks\\' standing. But this and kindred wonders are fruits of the spell\\nwrought by Garibaldi, who wove the most discordant elements into\\nharmony, and made hostile factions work together for the common good,\\nfor the sake of the love they bore to him.\\n\\nAbout mid-day we arrive at a redoubt which covers a part of the road,\\nleaving barely enough space for one vehicle to pass. We are of course\\nstopped, but are courteously received by the officer of the guard.\\nWe show our pass from General Turr, giving us permission \"freely to\\ntraverse all parts of the camp,\" and being told to drive on, find\\nourselves within the lines. As we proceed, we see laborers busily\\nengaged throwing up breastworks, soldiers reposing beneath the trees,\\nand on every side the paraphernalia of war.\\n\\nGaribaldi is not here, nor do we find him at Santa Maria. So we prolong\\nour ride to the twentieth mile by driving our reeking, but still\\nvigorous horses to Sant\\' Angelo.\\n\\nWe are now in sight of Capua, where Francis II. is shut up with a strong\\ngarrison. The place is a compact walled town, crowned by the dome of a\\nlarge and handsome church, and situated in a plain by the side of the\\nVolturno. Though, contrary to expectation, there is no firing to-day, we\\nsee all about us the havoc of previous cannonadings. The houses we pass\\nare riddled with round shot thrown by the besieged, and the ground is\\nstrewn with the limbs of trees severed by iron missiles. But where is\\nGaribaldi? No one knows. Yonder, however, is a lofty hill, and upon its\\nsummit we descry three or four persons. It is there, we are told, that\\nthe Commander-in-Chief goes to observe the enemy, and among the forms we\\nsee is very probably the one we seek.\\n\\nWe have just got into our carriage again, and are debating as to whither\\nwe shall go next, when we are addressed from the road-side in English.\\nThere, dressed in the red shirt, are three young men, all not far from\\ntwenty years of age, members of the British regiment of \"Excursionists.\"\\nThey are out foraging for their mess, and ask a ride with us to Santa\\nMaria. We are only too glad of their company; and off we start, a\\ncarriage-full. Then commences a running fire of question and response.\\nWe find the society of our companions a valuable acquisition. They are\\nfrom London,--young men of education, and full of enthusiasm for\\nthe cause of Italian liberty. One of them is a connection of our\\ndistinguished countrywoman, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Before going to\\nSanta Maria, they insist on doing the honors, and showing the objects\\nof interest the vicinity. So they take us to their barrack, a large\\nfarm-house, and thence to \"the front.\" To the latter spot our coachman\\ndeclines driving, as his horses are not bullet-proof, and the enemy is\\nnot warranted to abstain from firing during our visit. So, proceeding on\\nfoot, we reach a low breastwork of sand-bags, with an orchard in advance\\nof it. Here, our companions tell us, was the scene of yesterday\\'s\\nskirmish, in which they took an active part. The enemy had thrown out a\\ndetachment of sharp-shooters, who had entered the wood, and approached\\nthe breastwork. A battalion of the English Volunteers was ordered up. As\\nthey marched eagerly forwards, a body of Piedmontese, stationed a little\\nfrom the road, shouted, \"_Vivano gl\\' Inglesi! Vivano gl\\' Inglesi!_\"\\nAt the breastworks where we are standing, the word was given to break\\nranks, and skirmish. Instantly they sprang over the wall, and took\\nposition behind the trees, to shoot \"wherever they saw a head.\" Each\\nsoldier had his \"covering man,\"--a comrade stationed about ten feet\\nbehind him, whose duty it was to keep his own piece charged ready to\\nkill any of the enemy who might attempt to pick off the leading man\\nwhile the latter was loading. One of my young friends had the hammer of\\nhis rifle shot off in his hand. He kept his position till another weapon\\nwas passed out to him. The action lasted till evening, when the enemy\\ndrew off, there being various and uncertain reports as to their loss.\\nOur British cousins had some ten wounded, besides the one killed.\\nFighting royalists, we will mention here, was no fancy-work about that\\ntime, as the Neapolitans had an ugly trick of extinguishing the eyes of\\ntheir prisoners, and then putting their victims to death.\\n\\nWe return to our carriage, drive into a sheltered spot, and give the\\nword of command to Antonio to open the hamper and deploy his supplies,\\nwhen hungry soldiers vie with the ravenous traveller in a knife-and-fork\\nskirmish. No fault was found with the _cuisine_ of the Hotel de Grande\\nBretagne.\\n\\nThe rations disposed of, we set off again for Santa Maria. Arrived at\\nthe village, at the request of our companions, we visit with them a\\nhospital, to see one of their comrades, wounded in the action of the\\npreceding day, and, as we are known to profess the healing art, to give\\nour opinion as to his condition. We enter a large court-yard surrounded\\nwith farm-buildings, one wing of which is devoted to hospital purposes.\\nWe find the wards clean and well ventilated, and wearing the look of\\nbeing well attended. This favorable condition is owing in great measure\\nto the interposition and supervision of several ladies, among whom are\\nspecially mentioned the two daughters of an English clergyman, without\\nomitting the name of the Countess della Torres. The wounded comrade of\\nour friends had been struck by a ball, which had not been readied by the\\nprobe, and was supposed to have entered the lung. The poor young fellow\\ndraws his rapid breath with much pain, but is full of pluck, and meets\\nthe encouraging assurances of his friends with a smile and words of\\nfortitude. Some time afterwards we learn that he is convalescent, though\\nin a disabled state.\\n\\nIt now becomes necessary to say our mutual farewells, which we do as\\ncordially as though we had been old friends. We go our respective ways,\\nto meet once more in Italy, and to renew our acquaintance again in\\nLondon, where we subsequently spend a pleasant evening together by a\\ncheerful English fireside.\\n\\nScarcely have we parted with these new-found friends of kindred blood\\nand common language, when we are provided with another companion.\\nAn Italian officer asks a seat with us to Caserta. Our letter of\\nintroduction to General Orsini being shown to him, he volunteers to\\nassist us in attaining our object, that of seeing the hero of Italy.\\nAt five, we are before the palace of Caserta, now a barrack, and the\\nhead-quarters of the Commander-in-Chief. The building is one of great\\nsize and beauty of architecture. A lofty arch, sustained by elegant and\\nmassive marble pillars, bisects the structure, and on either side one\\nmay pass from the archway into open areas of spacious dimensions, from\\nwhich lead passages to the various offices. We approach a very splendid\\nmarble staircase leading to the state apartments. A sentinel forbids us\\nto pass. This is, then, perhaps, the part of the building occupied by\\nthe Commander-in-Chief. Not so. The state apartments are unoccupied, and\\nare kept sacred from intrusion, as the property of the nation to which\\nthey are to belong. Garibaldi\\'s apartments are among the humblest in the\\npalace. We go on to the end of the archway, and see, stretching as far\\nas the eye can reach, the Royal Drive, leading through a fine avenue of\\ntrees, and reminding us of the \"Long Walk\" at Windsor Castle. Retracing\\nour steps, and crossing one of the court-yards, we ascend a modest\\nstaircase, and are in the antechamber of the apartments of the\\nCommander-in-Chief. There are sentinels at the outer door, others at\\nthe first landing, and a guard of honor, armed with halberds, in the\\nantechamber. Our courteous companion, by virtue of his official rank,\\nhas passed us without difficulty by the sentries, and quits us to\\ndischarge the duty which brought him to Caserta.\\n\\nWe are now eagerly expectant of the arrival of him whose face we have so\\nlong sought The hour is at hand when he joins his military family at an\\nunostentatious and very frugal dinner. In about half an hour there is\\na sudden cessation in the hum of conversation, the guard is ordered to\\nstand to arms, and in a moment more, amid profound silence, Garibaldi\\nhas passed through the antechamber, leaving the place, as it were,\\npervaded by his presence. We had beheld an erect form, of rather low\\nstature, but broad and compact, a lofty brow, a composed and thoughtful\\nface, with decision and reserved force depicted on every line of it.\\nIn the mien and carriage we had seen realized all that we had read and\\nheard of the air of one born to command.\\n\\nOur hero wore the characteristic red shirt and gray trousers, and,\\nthrown over them, a short gray cloak faced with red. When without the\\ncloak, there might be seen, hanging upon the back, and fastened around\\nthe throat, the party- kerchief usually appertaining to priestly\\nvestments.\\n\\nReturning to Naples, and sitting that night at our window, with the most\\nbeautiful of bays before us, we treasure up for perpetual recollection\\nthe picture of Garibaldi at head-quarters.\\n\\n\\nGARIBALDI AT POMPEII.\\n\\n\\nIt is Sunday, the 21st of October. We have to-day observed the people,\\nin the worst quarters of the city as well as in the best, casting their\\nballots in an orderly and quiet manner, under the supervision of the\\nNational Guard, for Victor Emmanuel as their ruler. To-morrow we have\\nset apart for exploring Pompeii, little dreaming what awaits us there.\\nOur friend, General J--n, of the British Army, learning that there is no\\nlikelihood of active operations at \"the front,\" proposes to join us in\\nour excursion.\\n\\nWe are seated in the restaurant at the foot of the acclivity which\\nleads to the exhumed city, when suddenly Antonio appears and exclaims,\\n\"Garibaldi!\" We look in the direction he indicates, and, in an avenue\\nleading from the railway, we behold the Patriot-Soldier of Italy\\nadvancing toward us, accompanied by the Countess Pallavicini, the wife\\nof the Prodictator of Naples, and attended by General Turr, with several\\nothers of his staff. We go out to meet them. General J--n, a warm\\nadmirer of Garibaldi, gives him a cordial greeting, and presents us as\\nan American. We say a few words expressive of the sympathy entertained\\nby the American people for the cause of Italy and its apostle. He whom\\nwe thus address, in his reply, professes his happiness in enjoying the\\ngood wishes of Americans, and, gracefully turning to our friend, adds,\\n\"I am grateful also for the sympathy of the English.\" The party then\\npass on, and we are left with the glowing thought that we have grasped\\nthe hand of Garibaldi.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, we are absorbed in examining one of the structures\\nof what was once Pompeii, when suddenly we hear martial music. We follow\\nthe direction of the sound, and presently find ourselves in the ancient\\nforum. In the centre of the inclosure is a military band playing the\\n\"Hymn of Garibaldi\"; while at its northern extremity, standing, facing\\nus, between the columns of the temple of Jupiter, with full effect given\\nto the majesty of his bearing, is Garibaldi. Moved by the strikingly\\ncontrasting associations of the time and the place, we turn to General\\nJ--n, saying, \"Behold around us the symbols of the death of Italy, and\\nthere the harbinger of its resurrection.\" Our companion, fired with a\\nlike enthusiasm, immediately advances to the base of the temple, and,\\nremoving his hat, repeats the words in the presence of those there\\nassembled.\\n\\n\\nGARIBALDI AT \"THE FRONT.\"\\n\\n\\nOnce again we look in the eye of this wonderful man, and take him by the\\nhand. This time it is at \"the front.\" On Saturday, the 27th of October,\\nwe are preparing to leave Naples for Rome by the afternoon boat, when we\\nreceive a message from General J--n that the bombardment of Capua is to\\nbegin on the following day at ten o\\'clock, and inviting us to join his\\nparty to the camp. Accordingly, postponing our departure for the North,\\nwe get together a few surgical instruments, and take a military train\\nupon the railway in the afternoon for the field of action.\\n\\nOur party consists of General J--n, General W., of Virginia, Captain\\nG., a Scotch officer serving in Italy, and ourself. Arrived at Caserta,\\nCaptain G., showing military despatches, is provided with a carriage, in\\nwhich we all drive to the advanced post at Sant\\' Angelo. We reach this\\nplace at about eight o\\'clock, when we ride and walk through the camp,\\nwhich presents a most picturesque aspect, illuminated as it is by a\\nbrilliant moon. We see clusters of white tents, with now and then the\\ngeneral silence broken by the sound of singing wafted to us from among\\nthem,--here and there tired soldiers lying asleep on the ground, covered\\nwith their cloaks,--horses picketed in the fields,--camp-fires burning\\nbrightly in various directions; while all seems to indicate the profound\\nrepose of men preparing for serious work on the morrow. We pass and\\nrepass a bridge, a short time before thrown across the Volturno. A\\nportion of the structure has broken down; but our English friends\\ncongratulate themselves that the part built by their compatriots has\\nstood firm. We exchange greetings with Colonel Bourdonne, who is on duty\\nhere for the night, superintending the repairs of the bridge, and who\\nkindly consigns us to his quarters.\\n\\nArrived at the farm-house where Colonel Bourdonne has established\\nhimself, and using his name, we are received with the utmost attention\\nby the servants. The only room at their disposal, fortunately a large\\none, they soon arrange for our accommodation. To General J---n, the\\nsenior of the party, is assigned the only bed; an Italian officer\\noccupies a sofa; while General W., Captain G., and ourself are ranged,\\n\"all in a row,\" on bags of straw placed upon the floor. Of the\\nmerriment, prolonged far into the night, and making the house resound\\nwith peals of laughter,--not at all to the benefit, we fear, of several\\nwounded officers in a neighboring room,--we may not write.\\n\\nSunday is a warm, clear, summer-like day, and our party climb the\\nprincipal eminence of Sant\\' Angelo to witness the expected bombardment.\\nWe reach the summit at ten minutes before ten, the hour announced for\\nopening fire. We find several officers assembled there,--among them\\nGeneral H., of Virginia. Low tone of conversation and a restrained\\ndemeanor are impressed on all; for, a few paces off, conferring with\\ntwo or three confidential aids, is the man whose very presence is\\ndignity,--Garibaldi.\\n\\nCasting our eye over the field, we cannot realize that there are such\\nhosts of men under arms about us, till a military guide by our side\\npoints out their distribution to us.\\n\\n\"Look there!\" says General H., pointing to an orchard beneath. \"Under\\nthose trees they are swarming thick as bees. There are ten thousand men,\\nat least, in that spot alone.\"\\n\\nWith an opera-glass we can distinctly scan the walls of Capua, and\\nobserve that they are not yet manned. But the besieged are throwing out\\ntroops by thousands into the field before our lines. We remark one large\\nbody drawn up in the shelter of the shadow cast by a large building.\\nEvery now and then, from out this shadow, a piercing ray of light is\\nshot, reflected from the helm or sword-case of the commanding officer,\\nwho is gallantly riding up and down before his men, and probably\\nharanguing them in preparation for the expected conflict. All these\\nthings strike the attention with a force and meaning far different from\\nthe impression produced by the holiday pageantry of mimic war.\\n\\nThe Commander-in-Chief is now disengaged, and our party approach him\\nto pay their respects. By the advice of General J---n, we proffer our\\nmedical services for the day; and we receive a pressure of the hand, a\\ngenial look, and a bind acknowledgment of the offer. But we are told\\nthere will be no general action to-day. Our report of these words, as\\nwe rejoin our companions, is the first intimation given that the\\nbombardment is deferred. But, though, there is some disappointment,\\ntheir surprise is not extreme. For Garibaldi never informs even his\\nnearest aide-de-camp what he is about to do. In fact, he quaintly says,\\n\"If his shirt knew his plans, he would take it off and burn it.\" Some\\nhalf-hour later, having descended from the eminence, we take our last\\nlook of Garibaldi. He has retired with a single servant to a sequestered\\nplace upon the mount, whither he daily resorts, and where his mid-day\\nrepast is brought to him. Here he spends an hour or two secure from\\ninterruption. What thoughts he ponders in his solitude the reader may\\nperhaps conjecture as well as his most intimate friend. But for us, with\\nthe holy associations of a very high mountain before our mind, we can\\nbut trust that a prayer, \"uttered or unexpressed,\" invokes the divine\\nblessing upon the work to which Garibaldi devotes himself,--the\\npolitical salvation of his country.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTWO OR THREE TROUBLES.\\n\\n[Concluded.]\\n\\n\\nEvery day, and twice a day, came Mr. Sampson,--though I have not said\\nmuch about it; and now it was only a week before our marriage. This\\nevening he came in very weary with his day\\'s work,--getting a wretched\\nman off from hanging, who probably deserved it richly. (It is said,\\nwomen are always for hanging: and that is very likely. I remember, when\\nthere had been a terrible murder in our parlors, as it were, and it was\\ndoubtful for some time whether the murderer would be convicted, Mrs.\\nHarris said, plaintively, \"Oh, do hang somebody!\") Mr. Sampson did\\nnot think so, apparently, but sat on the sofa by the window, dull and\\nabstracted.\\n\\nIf I had been his wife, I should have done as I always do now in such a\\ncase: walked up to him, settled the sofa-cushion, and said,--\"Here, now!\\nlie down, and don\\'t speak a word for two hours. Meantime I will tell you\\nwho has been here, and everything.\" Thus I should rest and divert him by\\nidle chatter, bathing his tired brain with good Cologne; and if, in the\\nmiddle of my best story and funniest joke, he fairly dropped off to\\nsleep, I should just fan him softly, keep the flies away, say in my\\nheart, \"Bless him! there he goes! hands couldn\\'t mend him!\"--and then\\nlook at him with as much more pride and satisfaction than, at any other\\ncommon wide-awake face as it is possible to conceive.\\n\\nHowever, not being married, and having a whole week more to be silly\\nin, I was both silly and suspicious. This was partly his fault. He was\\nreserved, naturally and habitually; and as he didn\\'t tell me he was\\ntired and soul-weary, I never thought of that. Instead, as he sat on the\\nsofa, I took a long string of knitting-work and seated myself across the\\nroom,--partly so that he might come to me, where there was a good seat.\\nThen, as he did not cross the room, but still sat quietly on the sofa,\\nI began to wonder and suspect. Did he work too hard? Did he dread\\nundertaking matrimony? Did he wish he could get off? Why did he not come\\nand speak to me? What had I done? Nothing! Nothing!\\n\\nHere Laura came in to say she was going to Mrs. Harris\\'s to get the\\nnewest news about sleeves. Mrs. Harris for sleeves; Mrs. Gore for\\nbonnets; and for housekeeping, recipes, and all that, who but Mrs.\\nParker, who knew that, and a hundred other things? Many-sided are we\\nall: talking sentiment with this one, housekeeping with that, and to a\\nthird saying what wild horses would not tear from us to the two first!\\n\\nLaura went. And presently he said, wearily, but _I_ thought drearily,--\\n\\n\"Delphine, are you all ready to be married?\"\\n\\nThe blood flushed from my heart to my forehead and back again. So, then,\\nhe thought I was ready and waiting to drop like a ripe plum into his\\nmouth, without his asking me! Am I ready, indeed? And suppose I am\\nnot? Perhaps I, too, may have my misgivings. A woman\\'s place is not a\\nsinecure. Troubles, annoyances, as the sparks fly upward! Buttons to\\nbegin with, and everything to end with! What did Mrs. Hemans say, poor\\nwoman?\\n\\n  \"Her lot is on you! silent tears to weep,\\n  And patient smiles to wear through suffering\\'s hour,\\n  And sumless riches from affection\\'s deep\\n  To pour on\"--something--\"a wasted shower!\"\\n\\nYes, wasted, indeed! I hadn\\'t answered a word to his question.\\n\\n\"It seems warm in this room,\" said he again, languidly; \"shall we walk\\non the piazza?\"\\n\\n\"I think not,\" I answered, curtly; \"I am not warm.\"\\n\\nEven that, did not bring him to me. He still leaned his head on his hand\\nfor a minute or two, and then rose from the sofa and sat by the window,\\nlooking at the western sky, where the sun had long gone down. I could\\nsee his profile against the outer light, however, and it did not look\\nplacid. His brow was knit and mouth compressed. So, then, it was all\\nvery likely!\\n\\nHaving set out on my race of suspecting, my steeds did not lag. They\\nwere winged already, and I goaded them continually with memories. There\\nwas nothing I did not think of or accuse him of,--especially, the last\\nand worst sin of breaking off our engagement at the eleventh hour!--and\\nI, who had suffered silently, secretly, untold torments about that name\\nof his,--nobody, no man, could ever guess how keenly, because no man can\\never feel as a woman does about such things! Men,--they would as soon\\nmarry Tabitha as Juliana. They could call her \"Wife.\" It made no matter\\nto them. What did any man care, provided she chronicled small beer,\\nwhether she had taste, feeling, sentiment, anything? Here I was wrong,\\nas most passionate people are at some time in their lives. Some men do\\ncare.\\n\\nAt the moment I had reached the top-most pinnacle of my wrath, and was\\ndarting lightnings on all mankind, Polly showed in Lieutenant Herbert,\\nwith his book of promised engravings.\\n\\nWith a natural revulsion of temper, I descended rapidly from my\\npinnacle, and, stepping half-way across the room, met the Lieutenant\\nwith unusual cordiality. Mr. Sampson bowed slightly and sat still. I\\ndrew two chairs towards the centre-table, lighted the argand, and seated\\nmyself with the young officer to examine and admire the beautiful\\nforms in which the gifted artist has clothed the words rather than the\\nthoughts of the writer,--out of the coarse real, lifting the scenes into\\nthe sweet ideal,--and out of the commonest, rudest New-England life,\\nbringing the purest and most charming idyllic song. We did not say this.\\n\\nI looked across at the window, where still sat the figure, motionless.\\nNot a word from him. I looked at Lieutenant Herbert. He was really very\\nhandsome, with an imperial brow, and roseate lips like a girl\\'s. Somehow\\nhe made me think of Claverhouse,--so feminine in feature, so martial in\\naction! Then he talked,--talked really quite well,--reflected my own\\nideas in an animated and eloquent manner.\\n\\nWhy it was,--whether Herbert suspected we had had a lovers\\' quarrel,--or\\nwhether his vanity was flattered at my attention to him, which was\\nentirely unusual,--or whether my own excited, nervous condition led me\\nto express the most joyous life and good-humor, and shut down all my\\nangry sorrow and indignant suspicions, while I smiled and danced over\\ntheir sepulchre,--however it was, I know not,--but a new sparkle\\ncame into the blue eyes of the young militaire. He was positively\\nentertaining. Conscious that he was talking well, he talked better. He\\nrecited poetry; he was even witty, or seemed so. With the magnetism of\\ncordial sympathy, I called out from his memory treasures new and old. He\\nbecame not only animated, but devoted.\\n\\nAll this time the figure at the window sat calm and composed. It was\\nintensely, madly provoking. He was so very sure of me, it appeared, he\\nwould not take the trouble to enter the lists to shiver a lance with\\nthis elegant young man with the beautiful name, the beautiful lips, and\\nwith, for the last half-hour at least, the beautiful tongue. He would\\nnot trouble himself to entertain his future wife. He would not trouble\\nhimself even to speak. Very well! Very well indeed! Did the Lieutenant\\nlike music? If \"he\" did not care a jot for me, perhaps others did. My\\nheart beat very fast now; my cheeks burned, and my lips were parched. A\\nglass of water restored me to calmness, and I sat at the piano. Herbert\\nturned over the music, while I rattled off whatever came to my fingers\\'\\nends,--I did not mind or know what. It was very fine, I dare say. He\\nwhispered that it was \"so beautiful!\"--and I answered nothing, but kept\\non playing, playing, playing, as the little girl in the Danish story\\nkeeps on dancing, dancing, dancing, with the fairy red shoes on. Should\\nI play on forever? In the church,--out of it,--up the street,--down the\\nstreet,--out in the fields,--under the trees,--by the wood,--by the\\nwater,--in cathedrals,--I heard something murmuring,--something softly,\\nsoftly in my ear. Still I played on and on, and still something murmured\\nsoftly, softly in my ear. I looked at the window. The head was leaned\\ndown, and resting on both arms. Fast asleep, probably. Then I played\\nlouder, and faster, and wilder.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, as deaf persons are said to hear well in\\nthe noise of a crowded street, or in a rail-car, so did I hear in the\\nmusical tumult, for the first time, the words of Herbert. They had been\\nwhispered, and I had heard, but not perceived them, till this moment.\\n\\nI turned towards him, looked him full in the face, and dropped both\\nhands into my lap. Well might I be astonished! He started and blushed\\nviolently, but said nothing. As for me, I was never more calm in my\\nlife. In the face of a real mistake, all imaginary ones fell to the\\nground, motionless as so many men of straw. With an instinct that went\\nbefore thought, and was born of my complete love and perfect reliance on\\nmy future husband, I pushed back the music-stool, and walked straight\\nacross the room to the window.\\n\\nHis head was indeed leaned on his arms; but he was white and insensible.\\n\\n\"Come here!\" I said, sternly and commandingly, to Herbert, who stood\\nwhere I had left him. \"Now, if you can, hold him, while I wheel this\\nsofa;--and now, ring the bell, if you please.\"\\n\\nWe placed him on the couch, and Polly came running in.\\n\\n\"Now, good-night, Sir; we can take care of him. With very many thanks\\nfor your politeness,\" I added, coldly; \"and I will send home the book\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\nHe muttered something about keeping it as long as I wished, and I turned\\nmy back on him.\\n\\n\"Oh! oh!--what had _he_ thought all this time?--what had he suffered?\\nHow his heart must have been agonized!--how terribly he must have felt\\nthe mortification,--the distress! Oh!\"\\n\\nWe recovered him at length from the dead faint into which he had fallen.\\nPolly, who thought but of the body, insisted on bringing him \"a good\\nheavy-glass of Port-wine sangaree, with toasted crackers in it\"; and\\nwouldn\\'t let him speak till he had drunken and eaten. Then she went out\\nof the room, and left me alone with my justly incensed lover.\\n\\nI took a _brioche_, and sat down humbly at the head of the sofa. He held\\nout his hand, which I took and pressed in mine,--silently, to be\\nsure; but then no words could tell how I had felt, and now felt,--how\\nhumiliated! how grieved! How wrongly I must have seemed to feel and to\\nact! how wrongly I must have acted,--though my conscience excused me\\nfrom feeling wrongly,--so to have deluded Herbert!\\n\\nAt last I murmured something regretful and tearful about Lieutenant\\nHerbert--Herbert! how I had admired that name!--and now, this Ithuriel\\ntouch, how it had changed it and him forever to me! What was in a\\nname?--sure enough! As I gazed on the pale face on the couch, I should\\nnot have cared, if it had been named Alligator,--so elevated was I\\nbeyond all I had thought or called trouble of that sort! so real was the\\ntrouble that could affect the feelings, the sensitiveness, of the noble\\nbeing before me!\\n\\nAt length he spoke, very calmly and quietly, setting down the empty\\ntumbler. I trembled, for I knew it must come.\\n\\n\"I was so glad that fool came in, Del! For, to tell the truth, I felt\\nreally too weak to talk. I haven\\'t slept for two nights, and have been\\non my feet and talking for four hours,--then I have had no dinner\"--\\n\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\\n\"And a damned intelligent jury, (I beg your pardon, but it\\'s a great\\ncomfort to swear, sometimes,) that I can\\'t humbug. But I must! I must,\\nto-morrow!\" he exclaimed, springing up from the sofa and walking\\nhurriedly across the room.\\n\\n\"Oh, do sit down, if you are so tired!\"\\n\\n\"I cannot sit down, unless you will let me stop thinking. I have but one\\nidea constantly.\"\\n\\n\"But if the man is guilty, why do you want to clear him?\" said I.\\n\\nNot a word had he been thinking of me or of Herbert all this time! But\\nthen he had been thinking of a matter of life and death. How all, all my\\nfoolish feelings took to flight! It was some comfort that my lover had\\nnot either seen or suspected them. He thought he must have been nearly\\nsenseless for some time. The last he remembered was, we were looking at\\nsome pictures.\\n\\nLaura came in from Mrs. Harris\\'s, and, hearing how the case was,\\ninsisted on having a chicken broiled, and that he should eat some\\ngreen-apple tarts, of her own cooking,--not sentimental, nor even\\nwholesome, but they suited the occasion; and we sat, after that, all\\nthree talking, till past twelve o\\'clock. No danger now, Laura said, of\\nbad dreams, if he did go to bed.\\n\\n\"But why do you care so very much, if you don\\'t get him off?--you\\nsuppose him guilty, you say?\"\\n\\n\"Because, Delphine, his punishment is abominably disproportioned to his\\noffence. This letter of the law killeth. And then I would get him off,\\nif possible, for the sake of his son and the family. And besides all\\nthat, Del, it is not for me to judge, you know, but to defend him.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--but if you do your best?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"A lawyer never does his best,\" he replied, hastily, \"unless he\\nsucceeds. He must get his client\\'s case, or get him off, I must get some\\nsleep to-night,\" he added, \"and take another pull. There\\'s a man on the\\njury,--he is the only one who holds out. I know I don\\'t get him. And I\\nknow why. I see it in the cold steel of his eyes. His sister was left,\\nwithin a week of their marriage-day, by a scoundrel,--left, too, to\\ndisgrace, as well as desertion,--and his heart is bitter towards all\\noffences of the sort. I must get that man somehow!\"\\n\\nHe was standing on the steps, as he spoke, and bidding me good-night;\\nbut I saw his head and heart were both full of his case, _and nothing\\nelse._\\n\\nThe words rang in my ear after he went away: \"Within a week of their\\nmarriage-day!\" In a week we were to have been married. Thank Heaven, we\\nwere still to be married in a week. And he had spoken of the man as \"a\\nscoundrel,\" who left her. America, indeed! what matters it? Still, there\\nwould be the same head, the same heart, the same manliness, strength,\\nnobleness,--all that a woman can truly honor and love. Not military, and\\nnot a scoundrel; but plain, massive, gentle, direct. He would do. And a\\nsense of full happiness pressed up to my very lips, and bubbled over in\\nlaughter.\\n\\n\"You are a happy girl, Del. Mrs. Harris says the court and everybody is\\ntalking of Mr. Sampson\\'s great plea in that Shore case. Whether he gets\\nit or not, his fortune is made. They say there hasn\\'t been such an\\nargument since Webster\\'s time,--so irresistible. It took every body off\\ntheir feet.\"\\n\\nI did not answer a word,--only clothed my soul with sackcloth and ashes,\\nand called it good enough for me.\\n\\nWe went to bed. But in the middle of the night I waked Laura.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said she, springing out of bed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t, Laura!--nothing,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, I thought you were ill! I\\'ve been sleeping with one eye open, and\\njust dropped away. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Do lie down, then. I only wanted to ask you a question.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _do_ go to sleep! It\\'s after three o\\'clock now. We never shall get\\nup. Haven\\'t you been asleep yet?\"\\n\\n\"No,--I\\'ve been thinking all the time. But you are impatient. It\\'s no\\nmatter. Wait till to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\n\"No. I am awake now. Tell me, and be done with it, Del.\"\\n\\n\"But I shall want your opinion, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _will_ you tell me, Del?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it is this. How do you think a handsome, a _very_ handsome\\nchess-table would do?\"\\n\\n\"Do!--for what?\"\\n\\n\"Why,--for my aunt\\'s wedding-gift, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that! And you have waked me up, at this time of night, from the\\nnicest dream! You cruel thing!\"\\n\\n\"I am so sorry, Laura! But now that you are awake, just tell me how you\\nlike the idea;--I won\\'t ask you another word.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,--very good,--excellent,\" murmured Laura.\\n\\nIn the course of the next ten minutes, however, I remembered that Laura\\nnever played chess, and that I had heard Mr. Sampson say once that he\\nnever played now,--that it was too easy for work, and too hard for\\namusement. So I put the chess-table entirely aside, and began again.\\n\\nA position for sleep is, unluckily, the one that is sure to keep one\\nawake. Lying down, all the blood in my body kept rushing to my brain,\\nkeeping up perpetual images of noun substantives. If I could have spent\\nmy fifty dollars in verbs, in taking a journey, in giving a _fete\\nchampetre_! (Garden lighted with Chinese lanterns, of course,--house\\ncovered inside and out with roses.) Things enough, indeed, there were to\\nbe bought. But the right thing!\\n\\nA house, a park, a pair of horses, a curricle, a pony-phaeton. But how\\nmany feet of ground would fifty dollars buy?--and scarcely the hoof of\\na horse.\\n\\nThere was a diamond ring. Not for me; because \"he\" had been too poor\\nto offer me one. But I could give it to him. No,--that wouldn\\'t do. He\\nwouldn\\'t wear it,--nor a pin of ditto. He had said, simplicity in dress\\nwas good economy and always good taste. No. Then something else,--that\\nwouldn\\'t wear, wouldn\\'t tear, wouldn\\'t lose, rust, break.\\n\\nAs to clothes, to which I swung back in despair,--this very Aunt Allen\\nhad always sent us all our clothes. So it would only be getting\\nmore, and wouldn\\'t seem to be anything. She was an odd kind of\\nwoman,--generous in spots, as most people are, I believe. Laura and\\nI both said, (to each other,) that, if she would allow us a hundred\\ndollars a year each, we could dress well and suitably on it. But,\\ninstead of that, she sent us every year, with her best love, a\\ntrunk full of her own clothes, made for herself, and only a little\\nworn,--always to be altered, and retrimmed, and refurbished: so that,\\nalthough worth at first perhaps even more than two hundred dollars,\\nthey came, by their unfitness and non-fitness, to be worth to us only\\nthree-quarters of that sum; and Laura and I reckoned that we lost\\nexactly fifty dollars a year by Aunt Allen\\'s queerness. So much for our\\ngratitude! Laura and I concluded it would be a good lesson to us about\\ngiving; and she had whispered to me something of the same sort, when\\nI insisted on dressing Betsy Ann Hemmenway, a little mulatto, in an\\nOriental caftan and trousers, and had promised her a red sash for her\\nwaist. To be sure, Mrs. Hemmenway despised the whole thing, and said she\\n\"wouldn\\'t let Betsy Ann be dressed up like a circus-rider, for nobody\";\\nand that she should \"wear a bonnet and mantilly, like the rest of\\nmankind.\" Which, indeed, she did,--and her bonnet rivalled the\\n_coiffures_ of Paris in brilliancy and procrastination; for it never\\ncame in sight till long after its little mistress. However, of that\\nby-and-by. I was only too glad that Aunt Allen had not sent me another\\nsilk gown \"with her best love, and, as she was only seventy, perhaps it\\nmight be useful.\" No,--here was the fifty-dollar note, thank Plutus!\\n\\nBut then, what to do with it? Sleeping, that was the question. Waking,\\nthat was the same.\\n\\nAt twelve o\\'clock Mr. Sampson came to dine with us, and to say he was\\nthe happiest of men.\\n\\n\"That is, of course, I shall be, next week,\" said he, smiling and\\ncorrecting himself. \"But I am rather happy now; for I\\'ve got my case,\\nand Shore has sailed for Australia. Good riddance, and may he never\\ntouch _these_ shores any more!\"\\n\\nHe had been shaking hands with everybody, he said,--and was so glad to\\nbe out of it!\\n\\n\"Now that it is all over, I wish you would tell me why you are so glad,\\nwhen you honestly believe the man guilty,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, my child, you are supposing the law to be perfect. Suppose the old\\nEnglish law to be in force now, making stealing a capital offence. You\\nwouldn\\'t hang a starving woman or child who stole the baker\\'s loaf from\\nyour window-sill this morning before Polly had time to take it in, would\\nyou? Yet this was the law until quite lately.\"\\n\\n\"After all, I don\\'t quite see either how you can bear to defend him, if\\nyou think him guilty, or be glad to have him escape, if he is,--I mean,\\nsupposing the punishment to be a fair one.\"\\n\\n\"Because I am a frail and erring man, Delphine, and like to get my case.\\nIf my client is guilty,--as we will suppose, for the sake of argument,\\nhe is,--he will not be likely to stop his evil career merely because he\\nhas got off now, and will be caught and hanged next time, possibly.\\nIf he does stop sinning, why, so much the better to have time for\\nrepentance, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh,--now be serious.\"\\n\\n\"I am. Once, I made up my mind as to my client\\'s guilt from what he told\\nand did not tell me, and went into court with a heavy heart. However, in\\nthe course of the trial, evidence, totally unexpected to all of us, was\\nbrought forward, and my client\\'s innocence fully established. It was a\\ngood lesson to me. I learned by experience that the business of counsel\\nis to defend or to prosecute, and not to judge. The judge and jury are\\nstereoscopic and see the whole figure.\"\\n\\nHow wise and nice it sounded! Any way, I wasn\\'t a stereoscope, for I saw\\nbut one side,--the one \"he\" was on.\\n\\nMonday morning. And we were to be married in the evening,--by ourselves,\\n--nobody else. That was all the stipulation my lover made.\\n\\n\"I will be married morning, noon, or night, as you say, and dress and\\nbehave as you say; but not in a crowd of even three persons.\"\\n\\n\"Not even Laura?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! Laura.\"\\n\\n\"Not even Polly?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! the household.\"\\n\\nAnd then he said, softly, that, if I wanted to please him,--and he knew\\nhis darling Del did,--I would dress in a white gown of some sort, and\\nput a tea-rose in my beautiful dark hair, and have nobody by but just\\nthe family and old Mr. Price, the Boynton minister.\\n\\n\"I know that isn\\'t what you thought of, exactly. You thought of being\\nmarried in church\"----\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, dear! old Mr. Price!\"--but I did not speak.\\n\\n\"But if you would be willing?\"----\\n\\n\"I supposed it would be more convenient,\" I muttered.\\n\\nVisions of myself walking up the aisle, with a white silk on, tulle\\nveil, orange-flowers, of course, (so becoming!) house crowded with\\nfriends, collation, walking under the trees,--all faded off with a\\nmournful cry.\\n\\nIt was of no use talking. Whatever he thought best, I should do, if it\\nwere to be married by the headsman, supposing there were such a person.\\nThis was all settled, then, and had been for a week.\\n\\nNobody need say that lovers, or even married lovers, have but one mind.\\nThey have two minds always. And that is sometimes the best of it; since\\nthe perpetual sacrifices made to each other are made no sacrifices, but\\nsweet triumphs, by their love. Still, just as much as green is composed\\nof yellow and blue, and purple of red and blue, the rays can any time\\nbe separated, and they always have a conscious life of their own. Of\\ncourse, I had a sort of pleasure even in giving up my marriage in\\nchurch; but I kept my blue rays, for all that,--and told Laura I dreaded\\nthe long, long prayer in that evening\\'s service, and that I hoped in\\nmercy old Mr. Price would have his wits about him, and not preach a\\nfuneral discourse.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Price is eighty-nine years old, Laura says,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes. He was the minister who married my father and mother, and has\\nalways been our minister,\" answered my lover.\\n\\nAnd so it was settled.\\n\\nLaura was rolling up tape, Monday morning, as quietly as if there were\\nto be no wedding. For my part, I wandered up and down, and could not set\\nmyself about anything.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Price! and a great long prayer! And that is to be the end\\nof it! My wedding-dress all made, and not to be worn! Flowers ditto!\\nNowhere to go, and so I shall stay at home. He has no house; so Taffy is\\nto come to mine!\"\\n\\nAnd here I burst out laughing; for it was as well to laugh as cry; and\\nbesides, I said a great many things on purpose to have Laura say what\\nshe always did,--and which, after all, it was sweet to me to hear. Those\\nwere silly days!\\n\\n\"No, Del,--that is not the end of it,--only the beginning of it,--of a\\nhappy, useful, good life,--your path growing brighter and broader every\\nyear,--and--and--we won\\'t talk of the garlands, dear; but your heart\\nwill have bridal-blossoms, whether your head has or not.\"\\n\\nLaura kissed me, with tears in her sisterly eyes. She never talks fine,\\nand went directly out of the room after this.\\n\\nI thought that women shouldn\\'t swear at all, or, if they did, should\\nbreak their oaths as gracefully as I did mine, when I whispered it was\\n\"_so_ good of him, to be willing I should stay in the cottage where I\\nhad always lived, and where every rose-tree and lilac knew me!\" And that\\nwas true, too. But not all the truth. What need to be telling truths all\\nthe time? And what had women tongues for, but to hold them sometimes?\\nPerhaps \"he,\" too, would have preferred a journey to Europe, and a house\\non the Mill-Dam.\\n\\nThings gradually settled themselves. My troubles seemed coming to a\\nclose by mechanical pressure. As to the name, it was better than Fire,\\nFamine, and Slaughter,--and I was to take it into consideration, any\\nway, and get used to it, if I could. The other trouble I put aside\\nfor the moment. After it was concluded on that the wedding should be\\nstrictly private, it was not necessary to buy my aunt\\'s present under\\na few days, and I could have the decided advantage, in that way, of\\navoiding a duplicate.\\n\\nThe Monday of my marriage sped away swiftly. Polly had come up early to\\nsay to \"Laury\" (for Polly was a free and independent American girl of\\nforty-five) that \"there\\'d be so much goin\\' to the door, and such, Betsy\\nAnn had best be handy by, to answer the bell. Fin\\'ly, she\\'s down there\\nwith her bunnet off, and goin\\' to stay.\"\\n\\nAs usual, Polly\\'s plans were excellent, and adopted. There would be all\\nthe wedding-presents to arrive, congratulatory notes, etc. Everything to\\narrange, and a thousand and one things that neither one nor three pairs\\nof hands could do. How I wished Betsy Ann would consent to dress like an\\nOriental child, and look pretty and picturesque,--like a Barbary slave\\nbearing vessels of gold and silver chalices, instead of her silly\\npointed waist and \"mantilly,\" which she persisted in wearing, and which,\\nof course, gave the look only of a stranger and sojourner in the land!\\n\\nI hoped she was a careful child,--there were so many things which might\\nbe spoiled, even if they came in boxes. Betsy Ann was instructed, on\\npain of--almost death, to be very, very careful, and to put everything\\non the table in the library. She was by no means to unpack an article,\\nnot even a bouquet. Laura and myself preferred to arrange everything\\nourselves. We proposed to place each of the presents, for that evening\\nonly, in the library, and spread them out as usual; but the very next\\nday, we determined, they should all be put away, wherever they were to\\ngo,--of course, we could not tell where, till we saw them. That was\\nLaura\\'s taste, and had come, on reflection, to be mine.\\n\\nLaura said she should make me presents only of innumerable stitches:\\nwhich she had done. Polly, whom it is both impossible and irrelevant to\\ndescribe, took the opportunity to scrub the house from top to bottom.\\nHer own wedding-present to me, homely though it was, I wrapped in silver\\npaper, and showed it to her lying in state on the library-table, to her\\ninfinite amusement.\\n\\nLike the North American Indian, the race of Pollies is fast going out\\nof American life. You read an advertisement of \"an American servant who\\nwants a place in a genteel family,\" and visions of something common in\\nAmerican households, when you were children, come up to your mind\\'s eye.\\nWithout considering the absurdity of an American girl calling herself by\\nsuch a name, your eyes fill with tears at the thought of the faithful\\nand loving service of years ago, when neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor\\ndeath itself separated the members of the household, but the nurse-maid\\nwas the beloved friend, living and dying under the same roof that\\nwitnessed her untiring and faithful devotion.\\n\\nSo, when you look after this \"American servant,\" you find alien blood,\\nlip-service, a surface-warmth that flatters, but does not delude,--a\\nfidelity that fails you in sickness, or increased toil, or the prospect\\nof higher wages; and you say to the \"American servant,\"--\\n\\n\"How long have you been in Boston?\"\\n\\n\"Born in Boston, Ma\\'m,--in Eliot Street, Ma\\'m.\"\\n\\nSo was not Polly. Polly had lived with us always. She had a farm of her\\nown, and needn\\'t have \"lived out\" five minutes, unless she had chosen.\\nBut she did choose it, and chose to keep her place. And that was a true\\nfriend,--in a humble position, possibly, yet one of her own choosing.\\nShe rejoiced and wept with us, knew all about us,--corresponded\\nregularly with us when away, and wrote poetry. She had a fair\\nmind, great shrewdness, and kept a journal of facts. We loved her\\ndearly,--next to each other, and a hundred times better than we did Aunt\\nAllen or any of them.\\n\\nOf course, as the day wore on, and afternoon came, and then almost night\\ncame, and still the bell had not once rung,--not once!--Polly was\\nnot the person to express or to permit the least surprise. Not Caleb\\nBalderstone himself had a sharper eye to the \"honor of the family.\"\\n_Why_ it was left to the doctrine of chances to decide. _That_ it was\\ngrew clearer and clearer every hour, as every hour came slowly by,\\nunladen with box or package, even a bouquet.\\n\\nBetsy Ann had grinned a great many times, and asked Polly over and over,\\n\"Where the presents all was?\" and, \"When I was to Miss Russell\\'s, and\\nMiss Sally was merried, the things come in with a rush,--silver, and\\ngold, and money, ever so much!\"\\n\\nHowever, here Polly snubbed her, and told her to \"shet up her head\\nquick. Most of the presents was come long ago.\"\\n\\n\"Such a piece of work as I hed to ghet up that critter\\'s mouth!\" said\\nPolly, laughing, as she assisted Laura in putting the last graces to my\\nsimple toilet before tea.\\n\\n\"There, now, Miss Sampson to be! I declare to man, you never looked\\nbetter.\\n\\n  \"\\'Roses red, violets blue,\\n  Pinks is pootty, and so be you.\\'\"\\n\\n\"How did you shut it, Polly?\" said Laura, who was very much surprised,\\nlike myself, at the non-arrivals, and who constantly imagined she\\nheard the bell. Ten arrivals we had both counted on,--ten,\\ncertainly,--fifteen, probably.\\n\\n\"Well, I told her the presents was all locked up; and if she was a\\nclever, good child, and went to school regular, and got her learnin\\'\\ngood, I\\'d certain show \\'em to her some time. I told her,\" added Polly,\\nwhisperingly, and holding her hand over her mouth to keep from loud\\nlaughter,--\"I told her I\\'d seen a couple on \\'em done up in beautiful\\nsilver paper!\"\\n\\nThe bell rang at last, and we all sprang as with an electric shock. It\\nwas old Mr. Price, led in reverently by Mr. Sampson. Tea was ready; so\\nwe all sat down to it.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what other people think of, when they are going to be\\nmarried,--I mean at the moment. Books are eloquent on the subject. For\\nmy part. I must confess, I thought of nothing. And let that encourage\\nthe next bride, who will imagine herself a dunce, because she isn\\'t\\nthinking of something fine and solemn. Perhaps I had so many ideas\\npressing in, in all directions, that the mind itself couldn\\'t act. Be\\nit as it may, I stood as if stupefied,--while old Mr. Price talked and\\nprayed, it seemed, an age. I was roused, however, and glad enough I\\nwasn\\'t in church, when he called out,--\\n\\n\"_Ameriky!_ do you take this woman for your wedded wife?\" and still more\\nrejoiced when he added, sternly,--\\n\\n\"_Delphiny!_\" (using the long _i_,) \"do you take _Ameriky?_\"\\n\\nWe both said \"Yes.\" And then he commended us affectionately and\\nreverently to the protection and love of Him who had himself come to a\\nwedding. He then came to a close, to Polly\\'s delight, who said she \"had\\nexpected nothin\\' but what the old gentleman would hold on an hour,\\n--missionaries to China, and all.\"\\n\\nOld Mr. Price took a piece of cake and a full glass of wine, and wished\\nus joy. He was fast passing away, and with him the old-class ministers,\\nnow only traditional, who drank their half-mug of flip at funerals, went\\nto balls to look benignantly on the scene of pleasure, came home at ten\\no\\'clock to write \"the improvement\" to their Sunday\\'s sermon, took the\\nother half-mug, and went to bed peaceably and in charity with the whole\\nparish. They have gone, with the stagecoaches and country-newspapers;\\nand the places that knew them will know them no more.\\n\\nBetsy Ann, who was mercifully admitted to the wedding, pronounced\\nit without hesitation the \"flattest thing she ever see,\"--and was\\nstraightway dismissed by Polly, with an extra frosted cake, and a charge\\nto \"get along home with herself.\" Then Mr. Sampson walked slowly home\\nwith Mr. Price, and Laura and myself were left looking at each other.\\n\\n\"Delphiny!\" said Laura.\\n\\n\"Ameriky!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Well,--it\\'s over now. If you had happened to be Mrs. Conant\\'s daughter,\\nyou know, your name would have been Keren-happuch!\"\\n\\n\"On the whole, I am glad it wasn\\'t in church,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Sampson returned before we had finished talking of that. And then\\nLaura, said, suddenly,--\\n\\n\"But you _must_ decide on Aunt Allen\\'s gift, Del. What shall it be? What\\nwill be pretty?\"\\n\\n\"You shall decide,\" said I, amiably, turning to my husband.\\n\\n\"Oh, I have no notion of what is pretty,--at least of but one\\nthing,--and that is not in Aunt Allen\\'s gift.\"\\n\\nHe laughed, and I blushed, of course, as he pointed the compliment\\nstraight at me.\\n\\n\"But you _must_ think. I cannot decide, I have thought of five hundred\\nthings already.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Laura,--what do you say?\" said he.\\n\\n\"I think a silver salver would be pretty, and useful, too.\"\\n\\n\"Pretty and useful. Then let it be a silver salver, and be done with\\nit,\" said he.\\n\\nThis notion of being \"done with it\" is so mannish! Here was my Gordian\\nknot cut at once! However, there was no help for it,--though now, more\\nthan ever, since there was no danger of a duplicate, did I long for the\\nfifty thousand different beautiful things the fifty dollars would buy.\\n\\nCircumstances aided us, too, in coming to a conclusion. I was rather\\ntired of rocking on these billows of uncertainty, even with the chance\\nof plucking gems from the depths. And Mrs. Harris was coming the next\\nday to tea, and to go away early to see Piccolomini sing and sparkle.\\n\\nWhen we sat down that next day at the table, I poured the tea into a\\ncup, and placed it on the prettiest little silver tray, and Polly handed\\nit to Mrs. Harris as if she had done that particular thing all her life.\\n\\n\"Beautiful!\" said Mrs. Harris, as it sparkled along back; \"one of your\\nwedding-gifts?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, carelessly,--\"Aunt Allen\\'s.\"\\n\\nSo much was well got over. My hope was that Mrs. Harris, who talked\\nwell, and was never weary of that sort of well-doing, would keep on her\\nown subjects of interest, to the exclusion of mine. Therefore, when she\\nsaid pleasantly, _en passant_,--\\n\\n\"By the way, Delphine, I see you have taken my advice about\\nwedding-presents. You know I always abominated that parading of gifts.\"\\n\\nLaura hastened to the rescue, saying,--\\n\\n\"Yes, we quite agree with you, and remember your decided opinions on\\nthat subject. Did you say you had been to the Aquarial Gardens?\"\\n\\nHow I wished I had been self-possessed enough to tell the whole story,\\nwith its ridiculous side out, and make a good laugh over it, as it\\ndeserved!--for Mrs. Harris wouldn\\'t stay in the Aquarial Gardens, which\\nshe pronounced a disgusting exhibition of \"Creep and Crawl,\" and that\\nit was all a set of little horrors; but swung back to wedding-gifts and\\nwedding-times.\\n\\n  \"\\'When I was young,--ah! woful _when!_--\\n  That I should say _when_ I was young!\\'\\n\\n\"it wasn\\'t fashionable, or, I should say, necessary, to buy something for\\na bride,\" said Mrs. Harris, meditatively, and looking back--as we could\\nsee by her eyes--a long way.\\n\\nFor my part, I thought she had much better choose some other subject,\\nconsidering everything. Certainly she had been one of the ten I had\\ncounted on. But she suddenly collected herself!\\n\\n\"I never look at a great needle-book, (\\'housewife,\\' we used to call\\nit,) full of all possible and impossible contrivances and conveniences,\\nwithout recalling my Aunt Hovey\\'s patient smile when she gave it to me.\\nShe was rheumatic, and confined for twenty years to her chair; and these\\n\\'housewives\\' she made exquisitely, and each of her young friends on her\\nwedding-day might count on one. Then Sebiah Collins,--she brought me a\\nbag of holders,--poor old soul! And Aunt Patty Hobbs gave me a bundle of\\nrags! She said, \\'Young housekeepers was allers a-wantin\\' rags, and, in\\ncourse, there wa\\'n\\'t nothin\\' but what was bran\\'-new out of the store.\\'\\nCan I ever forget the Hill children, with their mysterious movements,\\ntheir hidings, and their unaccountable absences? and then the\\nwork-basket on my toilet-table, on my wedding-morning! the little\\npin-cushions and emery-sacks, the fantastic thimble-cases, and the\\nfish-shaped needle-books! all as nice as their handy little fingers\\ncould make, and every stitch telling of their earnest love and bright\\nfaces!--Every one of those children is dead. But I keep the work-basket\\nsacred. I don\\'t know whether it is more pleasure or pain.\"\\n\\nShe looked up again, as if before her passed a long procession. I had\\noften seen that expression in the eyes of old, and even of middle-aged\\npersons, who had had much mental vicissitude, but I had not interpreted\\nit till now. It was only for a moment; and she added, cheerfully,--\\n\\n\"The future is always pleasant; so we will look that way.\"\\n\\nJust then a gentleman wished to see Mr. Sampson on business, and they\\ntwo went into the library.\\n\\nMrs. Harris talked on, and I led the way to the parlor. She said she\\nshould be called for presently; and then Laura lighted the argand, and\\ndropped the muslin curtains.\\n\\n\"Oh, isn\\'t this sweet?\" exclaimed Mrs. Harris, rapturously, approaching\\nthe table. \"How the best work of Art pales before Nature!\"\\n\\nIt was only a tall small vase of ground glass, holding a pond-lily,\\nfully opened. But it was perfect in its way, and I knew by the smile on\\nLaura\\'s lips that it was her gift.\\n\\n\"Mine is in that corner, Delphine,\" said Mrs. Harris. \"I wouldn\\'t have\\nit brought here till to-night, when I could see Laura, for fear you\\nshould have a duplicate. So here is my Mercury, that I have looked at\\ntill I love it. I wouldn\\'t give you one that had only the odor of the\\nshop about it; but you will never look at this, Del, without thoughts of\\nour little cozy room and your old friend.\"\\n\\n\"Beautiful! No, indeed! Always!\" murmured I.\\n\\nShe drew a little box from her pocket, and took out of it a taper-stand\\nof chased silver.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Gore asked me to bring it to you, with her love. She wouldn\\'t send\\nit yesterday, she said, because it would look so like nothing by the\\nside of costly gifts. Pretty, graceful little thing! isn\\'t it? It is an\\nevening-primrose, I think,--\\'love\\'s own light,\\'--hey, Delphine?\"\\n\\nWe had scarcely half admired the taper-stand and the Mercury when the\\ncarriage came for Mrs. Harris, who insisted on taking away Laura with\\nher to the opera.\\n\\n\"No matter whether you thought of going or not; and, happily, there\\'s\\nno danger of Delphine being lonely. \\'Two are company,\\' you know Emerson\\nsays, \\'but three are a congregation.\\' So they will be glad to spare you.\\nThere, now! that is all you want,--and this shawl.\"\\n\\nAfter they went, I sat listening for nearly half an hour to the low\\nmurmurs in the next room, and wishing the stranger would only go, so\\nthat I might exhibit my new treasures. At last the strange gentleman\\nopened the door softly, talking all the way, across the room, through\\nthe entry, and finally whispering himself fairly out-of-doors. When my\\nhusband came in, I was eager to show him the Mercury, and the lily, and\\nthe taper-stand.\\n\\n\"And do you know, after all, I hadn\\'t the real nobleness and\\ntruthfulness and right-mindedness to tell Mrs. Harris that these and\\nAunt Allen\\'s gift were all I had received! I am ashamed of myself, to\\nhave such a mean mortification about what is really of no importance.\\nCertainly, if my friends don\\'t care enough for me to send me something,\\nI ought to be above caring for it.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, Del. Your mortification is very natural. How can we\\nhelp caring? Do you like your Aunt Allen very much?\" added he, abruptly.\\n\\n\"Because she gave me fifty dollars? Yes, I begin to think I do,\" said I,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nHe looked at me quickly.\\n\\n\"Your Aunt Allen is very rich, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"I believe so. Why? You look very serious. I neither respect nor love\\nher for her riches; and I haven\\'t seen her these ten years.\"\\n\\nHe looked sober and abstracted; but when I spoke, he smiled a little.\\n\\n\"Do you remember Ella\\'s chapter on Old China?\" said he, sitting down on\\nthe sofa, and--I don\\'t mind saying--putting one arm round my waist.\\n\\n\"Yes,--why?\"\\n\\n\"Do you remember Bridget\\'s plaintive regret that they had no longer\\nthe good old times when they were poor? and about the delights of the\\nshilling gallery?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--what made you think of it?\"\\n\\n\"What a beautiful chapter that is!--their gentle sorrow that they could\\nno longer make nice bargains for books! and his wearing new, neat, black\\nclothes, alas! instead of the overworn suit that was made to hang on\\na few weeks longer, that he might buy the old folio of Beaumont and\\nFletcher! Do you remember it, Delphine?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do. And I think there is a deal of pleasure in considering and\\ncontriving,--though it\\'s prettier in a book\"--\\n\\n\"For my part,\" interrupted my husband, as though he had not heard me\\nspeak,--\"for my part, I am sorry one cannot have such an exquisite\\nappreciation of pleasure but through pain; for--I am tired of\\nlabor--and privation--and, in short, poverty. To work so hard, and so\\nconstantly!--with such a long, weary vista before one!--and these petty\\ngains! Don\\'t you think poverty is the one thing hateful, Delphine?\"\\n\\nHe sprang up suddenly, and began walking up and down the room,--up and\\ndown,--up and down; and without speaking any more, or seeming to wish me\\nto answer.\\n\\n\"Why, what is it? What do you mean?\" said I, faintly; for my heart felt\\nlike lead in my bosom.\\n\\nHe did not answer at first, but walked towards me; then, turning\\nsuddenly away, sprang out of the window at the side of the room, saying,\\nwith a constrained laugh,--\\n\\n\"I shall be in again, presently. In the mean time I leave you to\\nmeditations on the shilling gallery!\"\\n\\nWhat a strange taunting sound his voice had! There was no insane blood\\namong the Sampsons, or I might have thought he had suddenly gone crazy.\\nOr if I had believed in demoniacal presences, I might have thought the\\nmurmuring, whispering old man was some tempter. Some evil influence\\ncertainly had been exerted over him. Scarcely less than deranged could I\\nconsider him now, to be willing thus to address me. It was true, he was\\npoor,--that he had struggled with poverty. But had it not been my pride,\\nas I thought it was his, that his battle was bravely borne, and would be\\nbravely won? I could not, even to myself, express the cruel cowardice of\\nsuch words as he had used to his helpless wife. That he felt deeply and\\ngallingly his poverty was plain. Even in that there was a weakness which\\ninduced more of contempt than pity for him; but was it not base to tell\\nme of it now? Now, when his load was doubled, he complained of the\\nburden! Why, I would have lain down and died far sooner than he should\\nhave guessed it of me. And he had thought it--and--said it!\\n\\nThere are emotions that seem to crowd and supersede each other, so\\nthat the order of time is inverted. I came to the point of disdainful\\ncomposure, even before the struggle and distress began. I sat quietly\\nwhere my husband left me,--such a long, long time! It seemed hours.\\nI remembered how thoughtful I had determined to be of all our\\nexpenses,--the little account-book in which I had already entered some\\nitems; how I had thought of various ways in which I could assist him;\\nyes, even little I was to be the most efficient and helpful of wives.\\nHad I not taken writing-lessons secretly, and formed a thorough\\nbusiness-hand, and would I not earn many half-eagles with my eagle\\'s\\nquill? I remembered how I had thought, though I had not said it, (and\\nhow glad now I was I had not!) that we would help each other in sickness\\nand health,--that we would toil up that weary hill where wealth stands\\nso lusciously and goldenly shining. But then, hand in hand we were\\nto have toiled,--hopefully, smilingly, lovingly,--not with this cold\\nrecrimination, nor, hardest of all, with--reproach!\\n\\nSuddenly, a strange suspicion fell over me. It fell down on me like a\\npall. I shuddered with the cold of it.\\n\\nI knew it wasn\\'t so. I knew he loved me,--that Le meant nothing,--that\\nit was a passing discontent, a hateful feeling engendered by the sight\\nof the costly trifles before us. Yes,--I knew that. But, good heavens!\\nto tell his wife of it!\\n\\nI sat, with my head throbbing, and holding my hands, utterly tearless;\\nfor tears were no expression of the distressful pain, and blank\\ndisappointment of a life, that I felt. I said I felt this damp, dark\\nsuspicion. It was there like a presence, but it was as indefinite as\\ndark; and I had a sort of control, in the midst of the tumult in my\\nbrain and heart, as to what thoughts I would let come to me. Not that!\\nFaults there might be,--great ones,--but not that, the greatest! At\\nleast, if I could not respect, I could forgive,--for he loved me.\\nSurely, surely, that must be true!\\n\\nIt would come, that flash, like lightning, or the unwilling memories of\\nthe drowning. I remembered the rich Miss Kate Stuart, who, they said,\\nliked him, and that her father would have been glad to have him for a\\nson-in-law. And I had asked him once about it, in the careless\\ngayety of happy love. He had said, he supposed it might have\\nhappened--perhaps--who knows?--if he had not seen me. But he had seen\\nme! Could it be that he was thinking of?\\n\\nMy calmness was giving way. As soon as I spoke, though it was only in a\\nword of ejaculation, my pity for myself broke all the flood-gates down,\\nand I fell on my face in a paroxysm of sobs.\\n\\nA very calm, loving voice, and a strong arm raising me, brought me back\\nat once from the wild ocean of passion on which I was tossing. I had not\\nheard him come in. I was too proud and grieved to speak or to weep. So I\\ndried my tears and sat stiffly silent.\\n\\n\"You are tired, dear!\" said my husband, tenderly.\\n\\n\"No,--it\\'s no matter.\"\\n\\n\"Everything is matter to me that concerns you. You know that,--you\\nbelieve that, Delphine?\"\\n\\n\"Why, what a strange sound! just as it used to sound!\" I said to myself,\\nwhisperingly.\\n\\nI know not what possessed me; but I was determined to have the truth,\\nand the whole truth. I turned towards him and looked straight into his\\neyes.\\n\\n\"Tell me, truly, as you hope God will save you at your utmost need, _do_\\nyou love me? Did you marry me from any motive but that of pure, true\\nlove?\"\\n\\n\"From no other,\" answered he, with a face of unutterable surprise; and\\nthen added, solemnly, \"And may God take me, Delphine, when you cease to\\nlove me!\"\\n\\nIt was enough. There was truth in every breath, in every glance of his\\ndeep eyes. A delicious languor took the place of the horrible tension\\nthat had been every faculty,--a repose so sweet and perfect, that, if\\nreason had placed the clearest possible proofs of my husband\\'s perfidy\\nbefore me, I should simply have smiled and fallen asleep on his true\\nheart, as I did.\\n\\nWhen I opened my eyes, I met his anxious look.\\n\\n\"Why, what has come over you, Del? I did not know you were nervous.\"\\n\\nAnd then remembering, that, although I might be weakest among the weak,\\nyet that it was his wisdom that was to sustain and comfort me, I said,--\\n\\n\"By-and-by I will tell you all about it,--certainly I will. I must tell\\nyou some time, but not to-night.\"\\n\\n\"And--I had thought to keep a secret from you, to-night, Del; but, on\\nthe whole, I shall feel better to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--perhaps,--perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes! Secrets are safest, told. First, then, Del, I will tell you\\nthis secret. I am very foolish. Don\\'t tell of it, will you? See here!\"\\n\\nHe held up his closed hand before my face, laughingly.\\n\\nThat man\\'s name, Del, is Drake\"----\\n\\n\"And not the Devil!\" said I to myself.\\n\\n\"Solitude Drake.\"\\n\\n\"Really? Is that it, truly? What\\'s in your hand?\"\\n\\n\"Truly,--really. He lives in Albany. He is the son of a queer man, and\\nis something of a humorist himself. I have seen one of his sons. He has\\ntwo. One\\'s name is Paraclete, and the other Preserved. His daughter is\\npretty, very, and her name is Deliverance. They call her Del, for short.\\nThey do, on my word! Worse than Delphine, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Why, don\\'t you like my name?\" stammered I, with astonishment.\\n\\n\"Yes, very well. I don\\'t care much about names. But I can tell you,\\nUncle Zabdiel and Aunt Jerusha, \\'from whom I have expectations,\\' Del,\\nthink it is \\'just about the poorest kind of a name that ever a girl\\nhad.\\' And our Cousin Abijah thought you were named Delilah, and that\\nit was a good match for Sampson! I rectified him there; but he still\\ninsists on your being called \\'Finy,\\' in the family, to distinguish you\\nfrom the Midianitish woman.\"\\n\\n\"And so Uncle _Zabdiel_ thinks I have a poor name?\" said I, laughing\\nheartily. \"The shield looks neither gold nor silver, from which side\\nsoever we gaze. But I think _he_ might put up with _my_ name!\"\\n\\nMy husband never knew exactly what I was laughing at. And why should he?\\nI was fast overcoming my weakness about names, and thinking they were\\nnothing, compared to things, after all.\\n\\nWhen our laugh (for his was sympathetic) had subsided into a quiet\\ncheerfulness, he said, again holding up his hand,--\\n\\n\"Not at all curious, Del? You don\\'t ask what Mr. Solitude Drake wanted?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I care what he wanted: company, I suppose.\"\\n\\nAnd I went on making bad puns about solitude sweetened, and ducks and\\ndrakes, as happy people do, whose hearts are quite at ease.\\n\\n\"And you don\\'t want to know at all, Del?\" said he, laughing a little\\nnervously, and dropping from his hand an open paper into mine. \"It shall\\nbe my wedding-present to you. It is Mr. Drake\\'s retainer. Pretty stout\\none, is it not? This is what made me jump out of the window,--this and\\none other thing.\"\\n\\n\"Why, this is a draft for five hundred dollars!\" said I, reading and\\nstaring stupidly at the paper.\\n\\n\"Yes, and I am retained in that great Albany land-case. It involves\\nmillions of property. That is all, Del. But I was so glad, so happy,\\nthat I was likely to do well at last, and that I could gratify all the\\nwishes, reasonable and unreasonable, of my darling!\"\\n\\n\"Is it a good deal?\" said I, simply; for, after all, five hundred\\ndollars did not seem such an Arabian fortune.\\n\\n\"Yes, Del, a good deal. Whichever way it is decided, it will make my\\nfortune. And now--the other thing. You are sure you are very calm, and\\nall this won\\'t make you sleepless?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! I am calm as a clock.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then,--your Aunt Allen is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Dead! Is she? Did she leave us all her money?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no, you little cormorant. She has left it all about: Legacies, and\\nAntioch College, and Destitute Societies. But I believe you have some\\nclothes left to you and Laura. Any way, the will is in there, in the\\nlibrary: Mr. Drake had a copy of it. And the best of all is, I am to be\\nthe executor, which is enough better than residuary legatee.\"\\n\\n\"It is very strange!\" said I, thinking of the multitude of old gowns I\\nshould have to alter over.\\n\\n\"Yes, it is, indeed, very strange. One of the strangest things about\\nthe matter is, that my good friend Solitude was so taken with \\'my queer\\nname,\\' as he calls it, that he \\'took a fancy to me out of hand.\\' To be\\nsure, he listened through my argument in the Shore case, and that may\\nhave helped his opinion of me as a lawyer.--Here comes Laura. Who would\\nhave thought it was one o\\'clock?\"\\n\\nAnd who would have thought that my little ugly chrysalis of troubles\\nwould have turned out such beautiful butterflies of blessings?\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nMARION DALE.\\n\\n\\n  Marion Dale, I remember you once,\\n  In the days when you blushed like a rose half-blown,\\n  Long ere that wealthy respectable dunce\\n  Sponged up your beautiful name in his own.\\n\\n  I remember you, Marion Dale,\\n  Artless and cordial and modest and sweet:\\n  You never walked in that glittering mail\\n  That covers you now from your head to your feet.\\n\\n  Well I remember your welcoming smile,\\n  When Alice and Annie and Edward and I\\n  Came over to see you;--you lived but a mile\\n  From my uncle\\'s old house, and the grove that stood nigh.\\n\\n  I was no lover of yours, (pray, excuse me!)--\\n  Our minds were different in texture and hue:\\n  I never gave you a chance to refuse me;\\n  Already I loved one less changeful than you.\\n\\n  Still it was ever a pride and a pleasure\\n  Just to be near you,--the Rose of our vale.\\n  Often I thought, \"Who will own such a treasure?\\n  Who win the rich love of our Marion Dale?\"\\n\\n  I wonder now if you ever remember,\\n  Ever sigh over fifteen years ago,--\\n  Whether your June is all turned to December,--\\n  Whether your life now is happy or no.\\n\\n  Gone are those winters of chats and of dances!\\n  Gone are those summers of picnics and rides!\\n  Gone the aroma of life\\'s young romances!\\n  Gone the swift flow of our passionate tides!\\n\\n  Marion Dale,--no longer our Marion,--\\n  You have gone your way, and I have gone mine:\\n  Lowly I\\'ve labored, while fashion\\'s gay clarion\\n  Trumpets your name through the waltz and the wine.\\n\\n  And when I meet you, your smile it is colder;\\n  Statelier, prouder your features have grown;\\n  Rounder each white and magnificent shoulder;\\n  (Rather too low-necked your waist, I must own.)\\n\\n  Jewelled and muslined, your rich hair gold-netted,\\n  Queenly \\'mid flattering voices you move,--\\n  Half to your own native graces indebted,\\n  Half to the station and fortune you love.\\n\\n  \"Marion\" we called you; my wife you called \"Alice\";\\n  I was plain \"Phil\";--we were intimate all:\\n  Strange, as we leave now our cards at your palace,\\n  On Mrs. Prime Goldbanks of Bubblemere Hall!\\n\\n  Six golden lackeys illumine the doorway:\\n  Sure, one would think, by the glances they throw,\\n  That we were fresh from the mountains of Norway,\\n  And had forgotten to shake off the snow!\\n\\n  They will permit us to enter, however;\\n  Usher us into her splendid saloon:\\n  There we sit waiting and waiting forever,\\n  As one would watch for the rise of the moon.\\n\\n  Or it may be to-day\\'s not her \"reception\":\\n  Still she\\'s at home, and a little unbends,--\\n  Framing, while dressing, some harmless deception,\\n  How she shall meet her \"American\" friends.\\n\\n  Smiling you meet us,--but not quite sincerely;\\n  Low-voiced you greet us,--but this is the _ton_:\\n  This, we must feel it, is courtesy merely,--\\n  Not the glad welcome of days that are gone.\\n\\n  You are in England,--the land where they freeze one,\\n  When they\\'ve a mind to, with fashion and form:\\n  Yet, if you choose, you can thoroughly please one:\\n  Currents run through you still youthful and warm.\\n\\n  So one would think, at least, seeing you moving,\\n  Radiant and gay, at the Countess\\'s _fete_.\\n  Say, was that babble so sweeter than loving?\\n  Where was the charm, that you lingered so late?\\n\\n  Ah, well enough, as you dance on in joyance!\\n  Still well enough, at your dinners and calls!\\n  Fashion and riches will mask much annoyance.\\n  Float on, fair lady, whatever befalls!\\n\\n  Yet, Lady Marion, for hours and for hours\\n  You are alone with your husband and lord.\\n  There is a skeleton hid in yon flowers;\\n  There is a spectre at bed and at board.\\n\\n  Needs no confession to tell there is acting\\n  Somewhere about you a tragedy grim.\\n  All your bright rays have a sullen refracting;\\n  Everywhere looms up the image of _him_:\\n\\n  Him,--whom you love not, there is no concealing.\\n  How _could_ you love him, apart from his gold?\\n  Nothing now left but your fire-fly wheeling,--\\n  Flashing one moment, then pallid and cold!\\n\\n  Yet you\\'ve accepted the life that he offers,--\\n  Sunk to his level,--not raised him to yours.\\n  All your fair flowers have their roots in his coffers:\\n  Empty the gold-dust, and then what endures?\\n\\n  So, then, we leave you!

It\\nis a circumstance which perhaps would never have reached the knowledge\\nof the magazine-reading world, nor have been of any importance to it,\\nbut for the attendant fact that I, the writer of this article, was on\\nboard the steamer. It takes two events to make a consequence, as well as\\ntwo parties to make a bargain.\\n\\nThe sea was smooth; the air was warmish and slightly misty; the low\\ncoast showed bare sand and forests of pines. The dangerous bar of the\\nport, now partially deprived of its buoys, and with its main channel\\nrendered perilous by the hulks of sunken schooners, revealed itself\\nplainly, half a mile ahead of us, in a great crescent of yellow water,\\nplainly distinguishable from the steel-gray of the outer ocean. Two\\nor three square-rigged vessels were anchored to the southward of us,\\nwaiting for the tide or the tugs, while four or five pilot-boats tacked\\nup and down in the lazy breeze, watching for the cotton-freighters which\\nought at this season to crowd the palmetto wharves.\\n\\n\"I wish we could get the duties on those ships to pay some of our\\nmilitary bills,\" said a genteel, clean-spoken Charlestonian, to a long,\\ngreen, kindly-faced youth, from I know not what Southern military\\nacademy.\\n\\nWe had arrived off the harbor about midnight, but had not entered, for\\nlack of a beacon whereby to shape our course. Now we must wait until\\nnoon for the tide, standing off and on the while merely to keep up our\\nfires. A pilot came under our quarter in his little schooner, and told\\nus that the steamer Nashville had got out the day before with only a\\nhard bumping. No other news had he: Fort Sumter had not been taken, nor\\nassaulted; the independence of South Carolina had not been recognized;\\nvarious desirable events had not happened. In short, the political world\\nhad remained during our voyage in that chaotic _status quo_ so loved by\\nPresident Buchanan. At twelve we stood for the bar, sounding our way\\nwith extreme caution. Without accident we passed over the treacherous\\nbottom, although in places it could not have been more than eighteen\\ninches below our keel. The shores closed in on both sides as we passed\\nonward. To the south was the long, low, gray Morris Island, with its\\nextinguished lighthouse, its tuft or two of pines, its few dwellings,\\nand its invisible batteries. To the north was the long, low, gray\\nSullivan\\'s Island, a repetition of the other, with the distinctions of\\nhigher sand-rolls, a village, a regular fort, and palmettos. We passed\\nthe huge brown Moultrie House, in summer a gay resort, at present a\\nbarrack; passed the hundred scattered cottages of the island, mostly\\nuntenanted now, and looking among the sand-drifts as if they had been\\nwashed ashore at random; passed the low walls of Fort Moultrie,\\nonce visibly yellow, but now almost hidden by the new _glacis_, and\\nsurmounted by piles of barrels and bags of sand, with here and there\\npalmetto stockades as a casing for the improvised embrasures; passed its\\nblack guns, its solidly built, but rusty barracks, and its weather-worn\\npalmetto flag waving from a temporary flag-staff. On the opposite side\\nof the harbor was Fort Johnstone, a low point, exhibiting a barrack, a\\nfew houses, and a sand redoubt, with three forty-two pounders. And\\nhere, in the midst of all things, apparent master of all things, at the\\nentrance of the harbor proper, and nearly equidistant from either shore,\\nthough nearest the southern, frowned Fort Sumter, a huge and lofty\\nand solid mass of brickwork with stone embrasures, all rising from\\na foundation of ragged granite boulders washed by the tides. The\\nport-holes were closed; a dozen or so of monstrous cannon peeped from\\nthe summit; two or three sentinels paced slowly along the parapet; the\\nstars and stripes blew out from the lofty flag-staff. The plan of Fort\\nSumter may be briefly described as five-sided, with each angle just so\\nmuch truncated as to give room for one embrasure in every story. Its\\nwhole air is massive, commanding, and formidable.\\n\\nEighty or a hundred citizens, volunteers, cadets from the military\\nacademy, policemen, and <DW64>s, greeted the arrival of the Columbia at\\nher wharf. It was a larger crowd than usual, partly because a report had\\ncirculated that we should be forced to bring to off Fort Sumter and give\\nan account of ourselves, and partly because many persons in Charleston\\nhave lately been perplexed with an abundant leisure. As I drove to my\\nhotel, I noticed that the streets showed less movement of business\\nand population than when I knew them four years ago. The place seemed\\ndirtier, too,--worse paved, shabbier as to its brick-work and stucco,\\nand worse painted,--but whether through real deterioration, or by\\ncomparison with the neatly finished city which I had lately left, I\\ncannot decide. There was surely not a third of the usual shipping, nor a\\nquarter of the accustomed cotton. Here and there were wharves perfectly\\nbare, not only of masting and of freight, but even of dust, as if they\\nhad not been used for days, or possibly for weeks.\\n\\nMy old hotel was as well kept, and its table as plentiful and excellent\\nas ever. I believe we are all aware by this time that Charleston has\\nnot suffered from hunger; that beef has not sold at thirty-five cents a\\npound, but rather at ten or fifteen; that its Minute Men have not\\nbeen accustomed to come down upon its citizens for forced dinners and\\ndollars; that the State loan was taken willingly by the banks, instead\\nof unwillingly by private persons; that the rich, so far from being\\nobliged to give a great deal for the cause of Secession, have generally\\ngiven very little; that the streets are well-policed, untrodden by mobs,\\nand as orderly as those of most cities; that, in short, the revolution\\nso far has been political, and not social. At the same time exports\\nand imports have nearly ceased; business, even in the retail form, is\\nstagnant; the banks have suspended; debts are not paid.\\n\\nAfter dinner I walked up to the Citadel square and saw a drill of the\\nHome Guard. About thirty troopers, all elderly men, and several with\\nwhite hair and whiskers, uniformed in long overcoats of homespun gray,\\nwent through some of the simpler cavalry evolutions in spite of their\\nhorses\\' teeth. The Home Guard is a volunteer police force, raised\\nbecause of the absence of so many of the young men of the city at the\\nislands, and because of the supposed necessity of keeping a strong hand\\nover the <DW64>s. A malicious citizen assured me that it was in training\\nto take Fort Sumter by charging upon it at low water. On the opposite\\nside of the square from where I stood rose the Citadel, or military\\nacademy, a long and lofty reddish-yellow building, stuccoed and\\ncastellated, which, by the way, I have seen represented in one of our\\nillustrated papers as the United States Arsenal. Under its walls\\nwere half a dozen iron cannon which I judged at that distance to be\\ntwenty-four pounders. A few <DW64>s, certainly the most leisurely part\\nof the population at this period, and still fewer white people, leaned\\nover the shabby fence and stared listlessly at the horsemen, with the\\nair of people whom habit had made indifferent to such spectacles. Near\\nme three men of the middle class of Charleston talked of those two\\neternal subjects, Secession and Fort Sumter. One of them, a rosy-faced,\\nkindly-eyed, sincere, seedy, pursy gentleman of fifty, congratulated the\\nothers and thanked God because of the present high moral stand of South\\nCarolina, so much loftier than if she had seized the key to her main\\nharbor, when she had the opportunity. Her honor was now unspotted; her\\ngood faith and her love of the right were visible to the whole world;\\nwhile the position of the Federal Government was disgraced and sapped by\\nfalsity. Better Sumter treacherously in the hands of the United States\\nthan in the hands of South Carolina; better suffer for a time under\\nphysical difficulties than forever under moral dishonor.\\n\\nSimple-hearted man, a fair type of his fellow-citizens, he saw but his\\nown side of the question, and might fairly claim in this matter to\\nbe justified by his faith. His bald crown, sandy side-locks, reddish\\nwhiskers, sanguineous cheeks, and blue eyes were all luminous with\\nconfidence in the integrity of his State, and with scorn for the\\nmeanness and wickedness of her enemies. No doubt had he that the fort\\nought to be surrendered to South Carolina; no suspicion that the\\nGovernment could show a reason for holding it, aside from low\\nself-interest and malice. He was the honest mouthpiece of a most\\npeculiar people, local in its opinions and sentiments beyond anything\\nknown at the North, even in self-poised Boston. Changing his subject, he\\nspoke with hostile, yet chivalrous, respect of the pluck of the Black\\nRepublicans in Congress. They had never faltered; they had vouchsafed no\\nhint of concession; while, on the other hand, Southerners had shamed him\\nby their craven spirit. It grieved, it mortified him, to see such a man\\nas Crittenden on his knees to the North, begging, actually with tears,\\nfor what he ought to demand as a right, with head erect and hands\\nclenched. He departed with a mysterious allusion to some secret of his\\nfor taking Fort Sumter,--some disagreeably odorous chemical\\npreparation, I guessed, by the scientific terms in which he beclouded\\nhimself,--something which he expected would soon be called for by the\\nGovernor. May he never smell anything worse, even in the other world,\\nthan his own compounds! Unionist, and perhaps Consolidationist, as I\\nam, I could not look upon his honest, persuaded face, and judge him a\\ntraitor, at least not to any sentiment of right that was in his own\\nsoul.\\n\\nOur hotel was full of legislators and volunteer officers, mostly\\nplanters or sons of planters, and almost without exception men of\\nstanding and property. South Carolina is an oligarchy in spirit, and\\nallows no plebeians in high places. Two centuries of plenteous feeding\\nand favorable climate showed their natural results in the _physique_ of\\nthese people. I do not think that I exaggerate, when I say that they\\naveraged six feet or nearly in height, and one hundred and seventy\\npounds or thereabouts in weight. One or two would have brought in money,\\nif enterprisingly heralded as Swiss or Belgian giants. The general\\nphysiognomy was good, mostly high-featured, often commanding, sometimes\\nremarkable for massive beauty of the Jovian type, and almost invariably\\ndistinguished by a fearless, open-eyed frankness, in some instances\\nrunning into arrogance and pugnacity. I remember one or two elderly\\nmen, in particular, whose faces would help an artist to idealize a\\nLacedaemonian general, or a baron of the Middle Ages. In dress somewhat\\ncareless, and wearing usually the last fashion but one, they struck me\\nas less tidy than the same class when I saw it four years ago; and I\\nmade a similar remark concerning the citizens of Charleston,--not only\\nmen, but women,--from whom dandified suits and superb silks seem to have\\ndeparted during the present martial time. Indeed, I heard that economy\\nwas the order of the day; that the fashionables of Charleston bought\\nnothing new, partly because of the money pressure, and partly because\\nthe guns of Major Anderson might any day send the whole city into\\nmourning; that patrician families had discharged their foreign cooks and\\nput their daughters into the kitchen; that there were no concerts, no\\nballs, and no marriages. Even the volunteers exhibited little of the\\npomp and vanity of war. The small French military cap was often the only\\nsign of their present profession. The uniform, when it appeared, was\\nfrequently a coarse homespun gray, charily trimmed with red worsted, and\\nstained with the rains and earth of the islands. One young dragoon in\\nthis sober dress walked into our hotel, trailing the clinking steel\\nscabbard of his sabre across the marble floor of the vestibule with a\\nwarlike rattle which reminded me of the Austrian officers whom I used\\nto see, yes, and hear, stalking about the _cafe\\'s_ of Florence. Half a\\ndozen surrounded him to look at and talk about the weapon. A portly,\\nmiddle-aged legislator must draw it and cut and thrust, with a smile of\\nboyish satisfaction between his grizzled whiskers, bringing the point so\\nnear my nose, in his careless eagerness, that I had to fall back upon\\na stronger, that is, a more distant position. Then half a dozen others\\nmust do likewise, their eyes sparkling like those of children examining\\na new toy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not very sharp,\" said one, running his thumb carefully along the\\nedge of the narrow and rather light blade.\\n\\n\"Sharp enough to cut a man\\'s head open,\" averred the dragoon.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a dam\\' shame that sixty-five men tharr in Sumter should make\\nsuch an expense to the State,\" declared a stout, blonde young rifleman,\\nspeaking with a burr which proclaimed him from the up-country. \"We\\nhaven\\'t even troyed to get \\'em out. We ought at least to make a troyal.\"\\n\\nAll strangers at Charleston walk to the Battery. It is the extreme point\\nof the city peninsula, its right facing on the Ashley, its left on the\\nCooper, and its outlook commanding the entire harbor, with Fort Sumter,\\nPort Pinckney, Fort Moultrie, and Fort Johnstone in the distance. Plots\\nof thin clover, a perfect wonder in this grassless land; promenades,\\nneatly fenced, and covered with broken shells instead of gravel; a\\nhandsome bronze lantern-stand, twenty-five feet high, meant for a\\nbeacon; a long and solid stone quay, the finest sea-walk in the United\\nStates; a background of the best houses in Charleston, three-storied and\\nfaced with verandas: such are the features of the Battery. Lately\\nfour large iron guns, mounted like field-pieces, form an additional\\nattraction to boys and soldierly-minded men. Nobody knew their calibre;\\nthe policemen who watched them could not say; the idlers who gathered\\nabout them disputed upon it: they were eighteen pounders; they were\\ntwenty-fours; they were thirty-sixes. Nobody could tell what they were\\nthere for. They were aimed at Fort Sumter, but would not carry half way\\nto it. They could hit Fort Pinckney, but that was not desirable. The\\npoliceman could not explain; neither could the idlers; neither can I.\\nAt last it got reported about the city that they were to sink any boats\\nwhich might come down the river to reinforce Anderson; though how the\\nboats were to get into the river, whether by railroad from Washington,\\nor by balloon from the Free States, nobody even pretended to guess.\\nStanding on this side of the Ashley, and looking across it, you\\nnaturally see the other side. The long line of nearly dead level, with\\nits stretches of thin pine-forest and its occasional glares of open\\nsand, gives you an idea of nearly the whole country about Charleston,\\nexcept that in general you ought to add to the picture a number of noble\\nevergreen oaks bearded with pendent, weird Spanish moss, and occasional\\ngreen spikes of the tropical-looking Spanish bayonet. Of palmettos there\\nare none that I know of in this immediate region, save the hundred or\\nmore on Sullivan\\'s Island and the one or two exotics in the streets\\nof Charleston. In the middle of the Ashley, which is here more than a\\nquarter of a mile wide, lies anchored a topsail schooner, the nursery\\nof the South Carolina navy. I never saw it sail anywhere; but then my\\nopportunities of observation were limited. Quite a number of boys are on\\nboard of it, studying maritime matters; and I can bear witness that they\\nare sufficiently advanced to row themselves ashore. Possibly they are\\nmoored thus far up the stream to guard them from sea-sickness, which\\nmight be discouraging to young sailors. However, I ought not to talk on\\nthis subject, for I am the merest civilian and land-lubber.\\n\\nMy first conversation in Charleston on Secession was with an estimable\\nfriend, Northern-born, but drawing breath of Southern air ever since he\\nattained the age of manhood. After the first salutation, he sat down,\\nhis hands on his knees, gazing on the floor, and shaking his head\\nsoberly, if not sadly.\\n\\n\"You have found us in a pretty fix,--in a pretty fix!\"\\n\\n\"But what are you going to do? Are you really going out? You are not a\\npolitician, and will tell me the honest facts.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we are going out,\\'--there is no doubt of it, I have not been a\\nseceder,--I have even been called one of the disaffected; but I am\\nobliged to admit that secession is the will of the community. Perhaps\\nyou at the North don\\'t believe that we are honest in our professions and\\nactions. We are so. The Carolinians really mean to go out of the Union,\\nand don\\'t mean to come back. They say that they _are_ out, and they\\nbelieve it. And now, what are you going to do with us? What is the\\nfeeling at the North?\"\\n\\n\"The Union must and shall be preserved, at all hazards. That famous\\ndeclaration expresses the present Northern popular sentiment. When I\\nleft, people were growing martial; they were joining military companies;\\nthey wanted to fight; they were angry.\"\\n\\n\"So I supposed. That agrees with what I hear by letter. Well, I am very\\nsorry for it. Our people here will not retreat; they will accept a war,\\nfirst. If you preserve the Union, it must be by conquest. I suppose you\\ncan do it, if you try hard enough. The North is a great deal stronger\\nthan the South; it can desolate it,--crush it. But I hope it won\\'t be\\ndone. I wish you would speak a good word for us, when you go back. You\\ncan destroy us, I suppose. But don\\'t you think it would be inhuman?\\nDon\\'t you think it would be impolitic? Do you think it would result in\\nsufficient good to counterbalance the evident and certain evil?\"\\n\\n\"Why, people reason in this way. They say, that, even if we allow the\\nfinal independence of the seceding States, we must make it clear that\\nthere is no such thing as the right of secession, but only that of\\nrevolution or rebellion. We must fix a price for going out of the Union,\\nwhich shall be so high that henceforward no State will ever be willing\\nto pay it. We must kill, once for all, the doctrine of peaceable\\nsecession, which is nothing else than national disintegration and ruin.\\nLieutenant-Governor Morton of Indiana declares in substance that England\\nnever spent blood and money to wiser purpose than when she laid down\\nfifty thousand lives and one hundred millions of pounds to prevent her\\nthirteen disaffected colonies from having their own way. No English\\ncolony since has been willing to face the tremendous issue thus offered\\nit. Just so it is the interest, it is the sole safety of the Federal\\nGovernment, to try to hold in the Cotton States by force, and, if they\\ngo out, to oblige them to pay an enormous price for the privilege.\\nRevolution is a troublesome luxury, and ought to be made expensive. That\\nis the way people talk at the North and at Washington. They reason thus,\\nyou see, because they believe that this is not a league, but a nation.\"\\n\\n\"And our people believe that the States are independent and have a right\\nto recede from the Confederation without asking its leave. With few\\nexceptions, all agree on that; it is honest, common public opinion. The\\nSouth Carolinians sincerely think that they are exercising a right, and\\nyou may depend that they will not be reasoned nor frightened out of it;\\nand if the North tries coercion, there will be war. I don\\'t say this\\ndefiantly, but sadly, and merely because I want you to know the truth.\\nWar is abhorrent to my feelings,--especially a war with our own\\nbrethren: and then _we_ are so poorly prepared for it!\"\\n\\nSuch was the substance of several conversations. The reader may rely, I\\nthink, on the justness of my friend\\'s opinions, founded as they are on\\nhis honesty of intellect, his moderation, and his opportunities for\\nstudying his fellow-citizens. All told me the same story, but generally\\nwith more passion, sometimes with defiance; defiance toward the\\nGovernment, I mean, and not toward me personally; for the better classes\\nof Charleston are eminently courteous. South Carolina had seceded\\nforever, defying all the hazards; she would accept nothing but\\nindependence or destruction; she did not desire any supposable\\ncompromise; she had altogether done with the Union. Yet her desire was\\nnot for war; it was simply and solely for escape. She would forget all\\nher wrongs and insults, she would seek no revenge for the injurious\\npast, provided she were allowed to depart without a conflict. Nearly\\nevery man with whom I talked began the conversation by asking if the\\nNorth meant coercion, and closed it by deprecating hostilities and\\naffirming the universal wish for _peaceable_ secession. In case of\\ncompulsion, however, the State would accept the gage of battle; her\\nsister communities of the South would side with her, the moment they saw\\nher blood flow; Northern commerce would be devoured by privateers of all\\nnations under the Southern flag; Northern manufactures would perish for\\nlack of Southern raw material and Southern consumers; Northern banks\\nwould suspend, and Northern finances go into universal insolvency; the\\nSouthern ports would be opened forcibly by England and France, who must\\nhave cotton; the South would flourish in the struggle, and the North\\ndecay.\\n\\n\"But why do you venture on this doubtful future?\" I asked of one\\ngentleman. \"What is South Carolina\\'s grievance? The Personal-Liberty\\nBills?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,--they constitute a grievance. And yet not much of one. Some of us\\neven--the men of the \\'Mercury\\' school, I mean--do not complain of the\\nUnion because of those bills. They say that it is the Fugitive-Slave Law\\nitself which is unconstitutional; that the rendition of runaways is\\na State affair, in which the Federal Government has no concern; that\\nMassachusetts, and other States, were quite right in nullifying an\\nillegal and aggressive statute. Besides, South Carolina has lost very\\nfew slaves.\"\\n\\n\"Is it the Territorial Question which forces you to quit us?\"\\n\\n\"Not in its practical issues. The South needs no more territory; has not\\n<DW64>s to colonize it. The doctrine of \\'No more Slave States\\' is an\\ninsult to us, but hardly an injury. The flow of population has settled\\nthat matter. You have won all the Territories, not even excepting New\\nMexico, where slavery exists nominally, but is sure to die out under the\\nhostile influences of unpropitious soil and climate. The Territorial\\nQuestion has become a mere abstraction. We no longer talk of it.\"\\n\\n\"Then your great grievance is the election of Lincoln?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And the grievance is all the greater because he was elected according\\nto all the forms of law?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"If he had been got into the Presidency by trickery, by manifest\\ncheating, your grievance would have been less complete?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Is Lincoln considered here to be a bad or dangerous man?\"\\n\\n\"Not personally. I understand that he is a man of excellent private\\ncharacter, and I have nothing to say against him as a ruler, inasmuch as\\nhe has never been tried. Mr. Lincoln is simply a sign to us that we are\\nin danger, and must provide for our own safety.\"\\n\\n\"You secede, then, solely because you think his election proves that the\\nmass of the Northern people is adverse to you and your interests?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"So Mr. Wigfall of Texas hit the nail on the head, when he said\\nsubstantially that the South cannot be at peace with the North until the\\nlatter concedes that slavery is right?\"\\n\\n\"Well,--I admit it; that is precisely it.\"\\n\\nI desire the reader to note the loyal frankness, the unshrinking honesty\\nof these avowals, so characteristic of the South Carolina _morale_.\\nWhenever the native of that State does an act or holds an opinion, it is\\nhis nature to confess it and avow the motives thereof, without quibbling\\nor hesitation. It is a persuaded, self-poised community, strikingly like\\nits negative pole on the Slavery Question, Massachusetts. All those\\nCharlestonians whom I talked with I found open-hearted in their\\nsecession, and patient of my open-heartedness as an advocate of the\\nUnion, although often astonished, I suspect, that any creature capable\\nof drawing a conclusion from two premises should think so differently\\nfrom themselves.\\n\\n\"But have you looked at the platform of the Republicans?\" I proceeded.\\n\"It is not adverse to slavery in the States; it only objects to its\\nentrance into the Territories; it is not an Abolition platform.\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t trust in the platform; we believe that it is an incomplete\\nexpression of the party creed,--that it suppresses more than it utters.\\nThe spirit which keeps the Republicans together is enmity to slavery,\\nand that spirit will never be satisfied until the system is extinct.\"\\n\\n\"Finally,--yes; gradually and quietly and safely,--that is possible. I\\nsuppose that the secret and generally unconscious _animus_ of the party\\nis one which will abolitionize it after a long while.\"\\n\\n\"When will it begin to act in an abolition sense, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say: perhaps a hundred years from now; perhaps two hundred.\"\\n\\nThere was a general laugh from the half-dozen persons who formed the\\ngroup.\\n\\n\"What time do _you_ fix?\" I inquired.\\n\\n\"Two years. But for this secession of ours, there would have been bills\\nbefore Congress within two years, looking to the abolition of slavery in\\nthe navy-yards, the District of Columbia, etc. That would be only the\\npoint of the wedge, which would soon assume the dimensions of an attack\\non slavery in the States. Look how aggressive the party has been in the\\nquestion of the Territories.\"\\n\\n\"The questions are different. When Congress makes local laws for Utah,\\nit does not follow that it will do likewise for South Carolina. You\\nmight as well infer, that, because a vessel sails from Liverpool to New\\nYork in ten days, therefore it will sail overland to St. Louis in five\\nmore.\"\\n\\nIncredulous laughter answered me again. The South has labored under two\\ndelusions: first, that the Republicans are Abolitionists; second, that\\nthe North can be frightened. Back of these, rendering them fatally\\neffective, lies that other delusion, the imagined right of peaceable\\nsecession, founded on a belief in the full and unresigned sovereignty of\\nthe States. Let me tell a story illustrative of the depth to which\\nthis belief has penetrated. Years ago, a friend of mine, talking to a\\nCharleston boy about patriotism, asked him, \"What is the name of your\\ncountry?\" \"South Carolina!\" responded the eight-year-old, promptly and\\nproudly. What Northern boy, what Massachusetts boy even, would not have\\nreplied, \"The United States of America\"?\\n\\nSouth Carolina, I am inclined to think, has long been a disunionist\\ncommunity, or nearly so, deceived by the idea that the Confederation is\\na bar rather than a help to her prosperity, and waiting only for a good\\nchance to quit it. Up to the election of Lincoln all timid souls were\\nagainst secession; now they are for it, because they think it less\\ndangerous than submission. For instance, when I asked one gentleman what\\nthe South expected to gain by going out, he replied, \"First, safety.\\nOur slaves have heard of Lincoln,--that he is a black man, or black\\nRepublican, or black something,--that he is to become ruler of this\\ncountry on the fourth of March,--that he is a friend of theirs, and will\\nfree them. We must establish our independence in order to make them\\nbelieve that they are beyond his help. We have had to hang some of them\\nin Alabama,--and we expect to be obliged to hang others, perhaps many.\"\\n\\nThis was not the only statement of the sort which I heard in Charleston.\\nOther persons assured me of the perfect fidelity of the <DW64>s, and\\ndeclared that they would even fight against Northern invaders, if\\nneedful. Skepticism in regard to this last comfortable belief is,\\nhowever, not wanting.\\n\\n\"If it comes to a war, you have one great advantage over us,\" said to me\\na military gentleman, lately in the service of the United States. \"Your\\nworking-class is a fighting-class, and will constitute the rank and file\\nof your armies. Our working-class is not a fighting-class. Indeed, there\\nis some reason to fear, that, if it take up arms at all, it will be on\\nthe wrong side.\"\\n\\nMy impression is, that a prevalent, though not a universal fear, existed\\nlest the <DW64>s should rise in partial insurrections on or about the\\nfourth of March. A Northern man, who had lived for several years in\\nthe back-country of South Carolina, had married there, and had lately\\ntravelled through a considerable portion of the South, informed me that\\nmany of the villages were lately forming Home Guards, as a measure of\\ndefence against the slave population. The Home Guard is frequently a\\ncavalry corps, and is always composed of men who have passed the usual\\nterm of military service; for it is deemed necessary to reserve the\\nyouth of the country to meet the \"Northern masses,\" the \"Federal\\nmercenaries,\" on the field of possible battle. By letters from\\nMontgomery, Alabama, I learn that unusual precautions have been common\\nduring the last winter, many persons locking up their <DW64>s over\\nnight in the quarters, and most sleeping with arms at hand, ready for\\nnocturnal conflict. Whoever considers the necessarily horrible nature\\nof a servile insurrection will find in it some palliation for Southern\\nviolence toward suspected incendiaries and Southern precipitation in\\nmatters of secession, however strongly he may still maintain that\\nlynch-law should not usurp the place of justice, nor revolution the\\nplace of regular government If you live in a powder-magazine, you\\npositively must feel inhospitably inclined towards a man who presents\\nhimself with a cigar in his mouth. Even if he shows you that it is but a\\ntireless stump, it still makes you uneasy. And if you catch sight of\\na multitude of smokers, distant as yet, but apparently intent on\\napproaching, you will be very apt to rush toward them, deprecate their\\nadvance, forbid it, or possibly threaten armed resistance, even at the\\nrisk of being considered aggressive.\\n\\nAre all the South Carolinians disunionists? It seemed so when I was\\nthere in January, 1861, and yet it did not seem so when I was there in\\n1855 and \\'56. At that time you could find men in Charleston who held\\nthat the right of secession was but the right of revolution, of\\nrebellion,--well enough, if successful, but inductive to hanging, if\\nunfortunate. Now those same men nearly all argue for the right of\\npeaceable secession, declaring that the State has a right to go out at\\nwill, and that the Federal Government has no right to coerce or punish\\nit. These turncoats are the sympathetic, who are carried away by a\\nrush of popular enthusiasm, and the fearful or peaceable, who dread or\\ndislike violence. Let us see how a timid Unionist can be converted into\\nan advocate of the right of secession. Let us suppose a boat with three\\nmen on board, which is hailed by a revenue-cutter, with a threat of\\nfiring, if she does not come to. Two of these men believe that the\\nrevenue-officer is performing a legal duty, and desire to obey him; but\\nthe third, a reckless, domineering fellow, seizes the helm, lets the\\nsail fill, and attempts to run by, meantime declaring at the top of his\\nvoice that the cutter has no business to stop his progress. The others\\ndare not resist him and cannot persuade him. Now, then, what position\\nwill they take as to the right of the revenue-officer to fire? Ten to\\none they will join their comrade whom they lately opposed; they will cry\\nout, that the pursuer was wrong in ordering them to stop, and ought not\\nto punish them for disobedience; in short, they will be converted by the\\ninstinct of self-preservation into advocates of the right of peaceable\\nsecession. I understand, indeed I know, that there are a few opponents\\nof disunion remaining In South Carolina; but, although they are wealthy\\npeople and of good position, it is pretty certain that they have not an\\natom of political influence.\\n\\nSecession peaceable! It is what is most particularly desired at\\nCharleston, and, I believe, throughout the Cotton States. Certainly,\\nwhen I was there, the war-party, the party of the \"Mercury,\" was not in\\nthe ascendant, unless in the sense of having been \"hoist with its own\\npetard\" when it cried out for immediate hostilities. Not only Governor\\nPickens and his Council, but nearly all the influential citizens, were\\nopposed to bloodshed. They demanded independence and Fort Sumter, but\\ndesired and hoped to get both by argument. They believed, or tried to\\nbelieve, that at last the Administration would hearken to reason and\\ngrant to South Carolina what it seemed to them could not be denied her\\nwith justice. The battle-cry of the \"Mercury,\" urging precipitation\\neven at the expense of defeat, for the sake of uniting the South, was\\nlistened to without enthusiasm, except by the young and thoughtless.\\n\\n\"We shall never attack Fort Sumter,\" said one gentleman. \"Don\\'t you see\\nwhy? I have a son in the trenches, my next neighbor has one, everybody\\nin the city has one. Well, we shan\\'t let our boys fight; we can\\'t bear\\nto lose them. We don\\'t want to risk our handsome, genteel, educated\\nyoung fellows against a gang of Irishmen, Germans, British deserters,\\nand New York roughs, not worth killing, and yet instructed to kill to\\nthe best advantage. We can\\'t endure it, and we shan\\'t do it.\"\\n\\nThis repugnance to stake the lives of South Carolina patricians against\\nthe lives of low-born, mercenaries was a feeling that I frequently heard\\nexpressed. It was betting guineas against pennies, and on a limited\\nstock of guineas.\\n\\nOther men, anti-secessionists even, assured me that war was inevitable,\\nthat Fort Sumter would be attacked, that the volunteers were panting for\\nthe strife, that Governor Pickens was excessively unpopular because of\\nhis peaceful inclinations, and that he would soon be forced to give the\\nsignal for battle. Once or twice I was seriously invited to stay a few\\ndays longer, in order to witness the struggle and victory of South\\nCarolina. However, it was clear that the enthusiasm and confidence of\\nthe people were no longer what they had been. Several dull and costly\\nweeks had passed since the passage of the secession ordinance.\\nStump-speeches, torchlight-processions, fireworks, and other\\njubilations, were among bygone things. The flags were falling to pieces,\\nand the palmettos withering, unnoticed except by strangers. Men had\\nbegun to realize that a hurrah is not sufficient to carry out a great\\nrevolution successfully; that the work which they had undertaken was\\nweightier, and the reward of it more distant, if not more doubtful, than\\nthey had supposed. The political prophets had been forced, like the\\nMillerites, to ask an extension for their predictions. The anticipated\\nfleet of cotton-freighters had not arrived from Europe, and the expected\\ntwelve millions of foreign gold had not refilled the collapsed banks.\\nThe daily expenses were estimated at twenty thousand dollars; the\\ntreasury was in rapid progress of depletion; and as yet no results. It\\nis not wonderful, that, under these circumstances, the most enthusiastic\\nsecessionists were not gay, and that the general physiognomy of the city\\nwas sober, not to say troubled. It must not be understood, however,\\nthat there was any visible discontent or even discouragement. \"We are\\nsuffering in our affairs,\" said a business-man to me; \"but you will\\nhear no grumbling.\" \"We expect to be poor, very poor, for two or three\\nyears,\" observed a lady; \"but we are willing to bear it, for the sake of\\nthe noble and prosperous end.\" \"Our people do not want concessions,\\nand will never be tempted back into the Union,\" was the voice of every\\nprivate person, as well as of the Legislature. \"I hope the Republicans\\nwill offer no compromise,\" remarked one excellent person who has not\\nfavored the revolution. \"They would be sure to see it rejected: that\\nwould humiliate them and anger them; then there would be more danger of\\nwar.\"\\n\\nHatred of Buchanan, mingled with contempt for him, I found almost\\nuniversal. If any Northerner should ever get into trouble in South\\nCarolina because of his supposed abolition tendencies, I advise him to\\nbestow a liberal cursing on our Old Public Functionary, assuring him\\nthat he will thereby not only escape tar and feathers, but acquire\\npopularity. The Carolinians called the then President double-faced\\nand treacherous, hardly allowing him the poor credit of being a\\nwell-intentioned imbecile. Why should they not consider him false? Up to\\nthe garrisoning of Fort Sumter he favored the project of secession full\\nas decidedly as he afterwards crossed it. Did he think that he was\\nlaying a train to blow the Republicans off their platform, and leave off\\nhis labor in a fright, when he found that the powder-bags to be exploded\\nhad been placed under the foundations of the Union? The man who could\\nexplain Mr. Buchanan would have a better title than Daniel Webster to be\\ncalled The Great Expounder.\\n\\nDuring the ten days of my sojourn, Charleston was full of surprising\\nreports and painful expectations. If a door slammed, we stopped talking,\\nand looked at each other; and if the sound was repeated, we went to\\nthe window and listened for Fort Sumter. Every strange noise was\\nmetamorphosed by the watchful ear into the roar of cannon or the rush of\\nsoldiery. Women trembled at the salutes which were fired in honor of the\\nsecession of other States, fearing lest the struggle had commenced and\\nthe dearly-loved son or brother in volunteer uniform was already under\\nthe storm of the columbiads. One day, a reinforcement was coming to\\nAnderson, and the troops must attack him before it arrived; the next\\nday, Florida had assaulted Fort Pickens, and South Carolina was bound\\nto dash her bare bosom against Fort Sumter. The batteries were strong\\nenough to make a breach; and then again, the best authorities had\\ndeclared them not strong enough. A columbiad throwing a ball of one\\nhundred and twenty pounds, sufficient to crack the strongest embrasures,\\nwas on its way from some unknown region. An Armstrong gun capable of\\ncarrying ten miles had arrived or was about to arrive. No one inquired\\nwhether Governor Pickens had suspended the law of gravitation in South\\nCarolina, in view of the fact that ordinarily an Armstrong gun will not\\ncarry five miles,--nor whether, in such case, the guns of Fort Sumter\\nmight not also be expected to double their range. Major Anderson was\\na Southerner, who would surrender rather than shed the blood of\\nfellow-Southerners. Major Anderson was an army-officer, incapable by his\\nprofessional education of comprehending State rights, angry because he\\nhad been charged with cowardice in withdrawing from Fort Moultrie, and\\nresolved to defend himself to the death.\\n\\nIn the mean time, the city papers were strangely deficient in local news\\nconcerning the revolution,--possibly from a fear of giving valuable\\nmilitary information to the enemy at Washington. Uselessly did I study\\nthem for particulars concerning the condition of the batteries, and\\nthe number of guns and troops,--finding little in them but mention\\nof parades, soldierly festivities, offers of service by enthusiastic\\ncitizens, and other like small business. I thought of visiting the\\nislands, but heard that strangers were closely watched there, and that\\na permit from authority to enter the forts was difficult to obtain.\\nFortune, or rather, misfortune, favored me in this matter.\\n\\nAfter passing six days in Charleston, hearing much that was\\nextraordinary, but seeing little, I left in the steamer Columbia for New\\nYork. The main opening to the harbor, or Ship Channel, as it is called,\\nbeing choked with sunken vessels, and the Middle Channel little known,\\nour only resource for exit was Maffitt\\'s Channel, a narrow strip of deep\\nwater closely skirting Sullivan\\'s Island. It was half-past six in the\\nmorning, slightly misty and very quiet Passing Fort Sumter, then Fort\\nMoultrie, we rounded a low break-water, and attempted to take the\\nchannel. I have heard a half-dozen reasons why we struck; but all I\\nventure to affirm is that we did strike. There was a bump; we hoped it\\nwas the last:--there was another; we hoped again:--there was a third; we\\nstopped. The wheels rolled and surged, bringing the fine sand from\\nthe bottom and changing the green waters to yellow; but the Columbia\\nremained inert under the gray morning sky, close alongside of the brown,\\ndamp beach of Sullivan\\'s Island. There was only a faint breeze, and a\\nmere ripple of a sea; but even those slight forces swung our stern far\\nenough toward the land to complete our helplessness. We lay broadside to\\nthe shore, in the centre of a small crescent or cove, and, consequently,\\nunable to use our engines without forcing either bow or stern higher\\nup on the sloping bottom. The Columbia tried to advance, tried to back\\nwater, and then gave up the contest, standing upright on her flat\\nflooring with no motion beyond an occasional faint bumping. The tugboat\\nAid, half a mile ahead of us, cast off from the vessel which it was\\ntaking out, and came to our assistance. Apparently it had been engaged\\nduring the night in watching the harbor; for on deck stood a score of\\nvolunteers in gray overcoats, while the naval-looking personage with\\ngrizzled whiskers who seemed to command was the same Lieutenant Coste\\nwho transferred the revenue-cutter Aiken from the service of the United\\nStates to that of South Carolina. The Aid took hold of us, broke a large\\nnew hawser after a brief struggle, and then went up to the city to\\nreport our condition.\\n\\nThe morning was lowery, with driving showers running through it from\\ntime to time, and an atmosphere penetratingly damp and cheerless. On the\\nbeach two companies of volunteers were drilling in the rain, no doubt\\ngetting an appetite for breakfast. Without uniforms, their trousers\\ntucked into their boots, and here and there a white blanket fastened\\nshawl-like over the shoulders, they looked, as one of our passengers\\nobserved, like a party of returned Californians. Their line was uneven,\\ntheir wheeling excessively loose, their evolutions of the simplest and\\nyet awkwardly executed. Evidently they were newly embodied, and from the\\ncountry; for the Charleston companies are spruce in appearance and well\\ndrilled. Half a dozen of them, who had been on sentinel duty during the\\nnight, discharged their guns in the air,--a daily process, rendered\\nnecessary by the moist atmosphere of the harbor at this season; and\\nthen, the exercise being over, there was a general scamper for the\\nshelter of a neighboring cottage, low-roofed and surrounded by a veranda\\nafter the fashion of Sullivan\\'s Island. Within half an hour they\\nreappeared in idle squads, and proceeded to kill the heavy time\\nby staring at us as we stared at them. One individual, learned in\\nsea-phrase, insulted our misfortune by bawling, \"Ship ahoy!\" A fellow\\nin a red shirt, who looked more like a Bowery _bhoy_ than like a\\nCarolinian, hailed the captain to know if he might come aboard;\\nwhereupon he was surrounded by twenty others, who appeared to\\nquestion him and confound him until he thought it best to disappear\\nunostentatiously. I conjectured that he was a hero of Northern birth,\\nwho had concluded to run away, if he could do it safely.\\n\\nWhen we tired of the volunteers, we looked at the harbor and its\\ninanimate surroundings. A ship from Liverpool, a small steamer from\\nSavannah, and a schooner or two of the coasting class passed by us\\ntoward the city during the day, showing to what small proportions the\\ncommerce of Charleston had suddenly shrunk. On shore there seemed to be\\nno population aside from the volunteers, Sullivan\\'s Island is a summer\\nresort, much favored by Charlestonians in the hot season, because of its\\ncoolness and healthfulness, but apparently almost uninhabited in winter,\\nnotwithstanding that it boasts a village called Moultrieville. Its\\nhundred cottages are mostly of one model, square, low-roofed, a single\\nstory in height, and surrounded by a veranda, a portion of which is in\\nsome instances inclosed by blinds so as to add to the amount of shelter.\\nPaint has been sparingly used, when applied at all, and is seldom\\nrenewed, when weather-stained. The favorite colors, at least those which\\nmost strike the eye at a distance, are green and yellow. The yards are\\napt to be full of sand-drifts, which are much prized by the possessors,\\nwith whom it is an object to be secured from high tides and other\\nmore permanent aggressions of the ocean. The whole island is but a\\nverdureless sand-drift, of which the outlines are constantly changing\\nunder the influence of winds and waters. Fort Moultrie, once close to\\nthe shore, as I am told, is now a hundred yards from it; while, half\\na mile off, the sea flows over the site of a row of cottages not long\\nsince washed away. Behind Fort Moultrie, where the land rises to its\\nhighest, appears a continuous foliage of the famous palmettos, a low\\npalm, strange to the Northern eye, but not beautiful, unless to those\\nwho love it for its associations. Compared with its brothers of the\\nEast, it is short, contracted in outline, and deficient in waving grace.\\n\\nThe chill mist and drizzling rain frequently drove us under\\ncover. \"While enjoying my cigar in the little smoking-room on the\\npromenade-deck, I listened to the talk of four players of euchre, two of\\nthem Georgians, one a Carolinian, and one a pro-slavery New-Yorker.\\n\\n\"I wish the Cap\\'n would invite old Greeley on board his boat in New\\nYork,\" said the Gothamite, \"and then run him off to Charleston. I\\'d give\\nten thousand dollars towards paying expenses; that is, if they could do\\nwhat they was a mind to with him.\"\\n\\n\"I reckon a little more\\'n ten thousand dollars\\'d do it,\" grinned\\nGeorgian First.\\n\\n\"They\\'d cut him up into little bits,\" pursued the New-Yorker.\\n\\n\"They\\'d worry him first like a cat does a mouse,\" added the Carolinian.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather serve Beecher or--what\\'s his name?--Cheever, that trick,\"\\nobserved Georgian Second. \"It\\'s the cussed parsons that\\'s done all the\\nmischief. Who played that bower? Yours, eh? My deal.\"\\n\\n\"I want to smash up some of these dam\\' Black Republicans,\" resumed the\\nNew-Yorker. \"I want to see the North suffer some. I don\\'t care, if New\\nYork catches it. I own about forty thousand dollars\\' worth of property\\nin ---- Street, and I want to see the grass growing all round it.\\nBlasted, if I can get a hand any way!\"\\n\\n\"I say, we should be in a tight place, if the forts went to firing now,\"\\nsuggested the Carolinian. \"Major Anderson would have a fair chance at\\nus, if he wanted to do us any harm.\"\\n\\n\"Damn Major Anderson!\" answered the New-Yorker. \"I\\'d shoot him myself,\\nif I had a chance. I\\'ve heard about Bob Anderson till I\\'m sick of it.\"\\n\\nOf this fashion of conversation you may hear any desired amount at the\\nSouth, by going among the right sort of people. Let us take it for\\ngranted, without making impertinent inquiry, that nothing of the kind\\nis ever uttered in any other country, whether in pot-house or parlor.\\nI suppose that such remarks seem very horrid to ladies and other\\ngentle-minded folk, who perhaps never heard the like in their lives,\\nand imagine, when they see the stuff on paper, that it is spoken with\\nscowling brows, through set teeth, and out of a heart of red-hot\\npassion. The truth is, that these ferocious phrases are generally\\ndrawled forth in an _ex-officio_ tone, as if the speaker were rather\\ntired of that sort of thing, meant nothing very particular by it, and\\ntalked thus only as a matter of fashion. It will be observed that the\\nmost violent of these politicians was a New-Yorker. I am inclined to\\npronounce, also, that the two Georgians were by birth New-Englanders.\\nThe Carolinian was the most moderate of the company, giving his\\nattention chiefly to the game, and throwing out his one remark\\nconcerning the worrying of Greeley with an air of simply civil assent\\nto the general meaning of the conversation, as an exchange of\\nanti-abolition sentiments. \"If you will play that card,\" he seemed to\\nsay, \"I follow suit as a mere matter of course.\"\\n\\nThere was a second attempt to haul us off at sunset, and a third in the\\nmorning, both unsuccessful. Each tide, though stormless, carried the\\nColumbia a little higher up the beach; and the tugs, trying singly\\nto move her, only broke their hawsers and wasted precious time.\\nFortunately, the sea continued smooth, so that the ship escaped a\\npounding. On Saturday, at eleven, twenty-eight hours after we struck,\\nall hope of getting off without discharging cargo having been abandoned,\\nwe passengers were landed on Sullivan\\'s Island, to make our way back\\nto Charleston. Our baggage was forwarded to the ferry in carts, and\\nwe followed at leisure on foot. In company with Georgian First and a\\ngentleman from Brooklyn, I strolled over the sand-rolls, damp and\\nhard now with a week\\'s rain, passed one or two of the tenantless\\nsummer-houses, and halted beside the _glacis_ of Fort Moultrie. I do not\\nwonder that Major Anderson did not consider his small force safe within\\nthis fortification. It is overlooked by neighboring sand-hills and by\\nthe houses of Moultrieville, which closely surround it on the land side,\\nwhile its ditch is so narrow and its rampart so low that a ladder of\\ntwenty-five feet in length would reach from the outside of the former to\\nthe summit of the latter. A fire of sharp-shooters from the commanding\\npoints, and two columns of attack, would have crushed the feeble\\ngarrison. No military movement could be more natural than the retreat to\\nFort Sumter. What puzzles one, especially on the spot, and what nobody\\nin Charleston could explain to me, is the fact that this manoeuvre could\\nbe executed unobserved by the people of Moultrieville, few as they are,\\nand by the guard-boats which patrolled the harbor.\\n\\nOn the eastern side of the fort two or three dozen <DW64>s were engaged\\nin filling canvas bags with sand, to be used in forming temporary\\nembrasures. One lad of eighteen, a dark mulatto, presented the very\\nremarkable peculiarity of chest-nut hair, only slightly curling. The\\nothers were nearly all of the true field-hand type, aboriginal black,\\nwith dull faces, short and thick forms, and an air of animal contentment\\nor at least indifference. They talked little, but giggled a great deal,\\nsnatching the canvas bags from each other, and otherwise showing their\\ndisbelief in the doctrine of all work and no play. When the barrows were\\nsufficiently filled to suit their weak ideal of a load, a procession of\\nthem set off along a plank causeway leading into the fort, observing a\\ndroll semblance of military precision and pomp, and forcing a passage\\nthrough lounging unmilitary buckras with an air of, \"Out of de way, Ole\\nDan Tucker!\" We glanced at the yet unfinished ditch, half full of water,\\nand walked on to the gateway. A grinning, skipping <DW64> drummer was\\nshowing a new pair of shoes to the tobacco-chewing, jovial youth who\\nstood, or rather sat, sentinel.\\n\\n\"How\\'d you get hold of _them?_\" asked the latter, surveying the articles\\nadmiringly.\\n\\n\"Got a special order frum the Cap\\'m fur \\'um. That ee way to do it. Won\\'t\\nwet through, no matter how it rain. He, he! I\\'m all right now.\"\\n\\nHere he showed ivory to his ears, cut a caper, and danced into the fort.\\n\\n\"D-a-m\\' nig-ger!\" grinned the sentinel, approvingly, looking at us to\\nsee if we also enjoyed the incident. Thus introduced to the temporary\\nguardian of the fort, we told him that we were from the Columbia, which\\nhe was glad to bear of, wanting to know if she was damaged, how she went\\nashore, whether she could get off, etc., etc. He was a fair specimen of\\nthe average country Southerner, lounging, open to address, and fond of\\ntalk.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve no authority to let you in,\" he said, when we asked that favor;\\n\"but I\\'ll call the corporal of the guard.\"\\n\\n\"If you please.\"\\n\\n\"Corporal of the guard!\"\\n\\nAppeared the corporal, who civilly heard us, and went for the lieutenant\\nof the guard. Presently a blonde young officer, with a pleasant face,\\nsomewhat Irish in character, came out to us, raising his forefinger in\\nmilitary salute.\\n\\n\"We should like to go into the fort, if it is proper,\" I said. \"We ask\\nhospitality the more boldly, because we are shipwrecked people.\"\\n\\n\"It is against the regulations. However, I venture to take the\\nresponsibility,\" was the obliging answer.\\n\\nWe passed in, and wandered unwatched for half an hour about the\\nirregular, many-angled fortress. One-third of the interior is occupied\\nby two brick barracks, covered with rusty stucco, and by other brick\\nbuildings, as yet incomplete, which I took to be of the nature of\\nmagazines. On the walls, gaping landward as well as seaward, are thirty\\nor thirty-five iron cannon, all _en barbette_, but protected toward the\\nharbor by heavy piles of sand-bags, fenced up either with barrels of\\nsand or palmetto-logs driven firmly into the rampart. Four eight-inch\\ncolumbiads, carrying sixty-four pound balls, pointed at Fort Sumter. Six\\nother heavy pieces, Paixhans, I believe, faced the neck of the harbor.\\nThe remaining armament of lighter calibre, running, I should judge, from\\nforty-twos down to eighteens. Only one gun lay on the ground destitute\\nof a carriage. The place will stand a great deal of battering; for the\\nwalls are nearly bidden by the sand-covered _glacis_, which would catch\\nand smother four point-blank shots out of five, if discharged from a\\ndistance. Against shells, however, it has no resource; and one mortar\\nwould make it a most unwholesome residence.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this?\" asked a volunteer, in homespun gray uniform, who, like\\nourselves, had come in by courtesy.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the butt of the old flag-staff,\" answered a comrade. \"Cap\\'n\\nFoster cut it down before he left the fort, damn him I It was a dam\\'\\nsneaking trick. I\\'ve a great mind to shave off a sliver and send it to\\nLincoln.\"\\n\\nThe idea of getting a bit of the famous staff as a memento struck\\nme, and I attempted to put it in practice; but the exceedingly tough\\npitch-pine defied my slender pocket-knife.\\n\\n\"Jim, cut the gentleman a piece,\" said one of the volunteers, Jim drew a\\ntoothpick a foot long and did me the favor, for which I here repeat my\\nthanks to him.\\n\\nThey were good-looking, healthy fellows, these two, like most of their\\ncomrades, with a certain air of frank gentility and self-respect about\\nthem, being probably the sons of well-to-do planters. It would be a\\ngreat mistake to suppose that the volunteers are drawn, to any extent\\nwhatever, from the \"poor white trash.\" The secession movement, like all\\nthe political action of the State at all times, is independent of the\\ncrackers, asks no aid nor advice of them, and, in short, ignores them\\nutterly.\\n\\n\"I was here when the Star of the West was fired on,\" the Lieutenant told\\nus. \"We only had powder for two hours. Anderson could have put us out in\\na short time, if he had chosen.\"\\n\\n\"How rapidly can these heavy guns be fired?\"\\n\\n\"About ten times an hour.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think the defences will protect the garrison against a\\nbombardment?\"\\n\\n\"I think the palmetto stockades will answer. I don\\'t know about that\\nenormous pile of barrels, however. If a shot hits the mass on the top, I\\nam afraid it will come down, bags and barrels together, bury the gun and\\nperhaps the gunners.\"\\n\\n\"What if Sumter should open now?\" I suggested.\\n\\n\"We should be here to help,\" answered the Georgian.\\n\\n\"We should be here to run away,\" amended my comrade from Brooklyn.\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose we should be of mighty little use, and might as well\\nclear out,\" was the sober second-thought of the Georgian.\\n\\nHaving satisfied our curiosity, we thanked the Lieutenant and left Fort\\nMoultrie. The story of our visit to it excited much surprise, when we\\nrecounted it in the city. Members of the Legislature and other men high\\nin influence had desired the privilege, but had not applied for it,\\nexpecting a repulse.\\n\\nA walk down a winding street, bordered by scattered cottages, inclosed\\nby brown board-fences or railings, and tracked by a horse-railroad built\\nfor the Moultrie House, led us to the ferry-wharf, where we found our\\nbaggage piled together, and our fellow-passengers wandering about in a\\nstate of bored expectation. Sullivan\\'s Island in winter is a good spot\\nfor an economical man, inasmuch as it presents no visible opportunities\\nof spending money. There were houses of refreshment, as we could see\\nby their signs; but if they did business, it was with closed doors\\nand barred shutters. After we had paid a newsboy five cents for the\\n\"Mercury,\" and five more for the \"Courier,\" we were at the end of our\\npossibilities in the way of extravagance. At half-past one arrived the\\nferry-boat with a few passengers, mostly volunteers, and a deck-load of\\nmilitary stores, among which I noticed Boston biscuit and several dozen\\nnew knapsacks. Then, from the other side, came the \"dam\\' <DW65>,\" that\\nis to say, the drummer of the new shoes, beating his sheepskin at the\\nhead of about fifty men of the Washington Artillery, who were on their\\nway back to town from Fort Moultrie. They were fine-looking young\\nfellows, mostly above the middle size of Northerners, with spirited and\\noften aristocratic faces, but somewhat more devil-may-care in expression\\nthan we are accustomed to see in New England. They poured down the\\ngangway, trailed arms, ascended the promenade-deck, ordered arms,\\ngrounded arms, and broke line. The drill struck me as middling, which\\nmay be owing to the fact that the company has lately increased to about\\ntwo hundred members, thus diluting the old organization with a large\\nnumber of new recruits. Military service at the South is a patrician\\nexercise, much favored by men of \"good family,\" more especially at this\\ntime, when it signifies real danger and glory.\\n\\nOur rajpoots having entered the boat, we of lower caste were permitted\\nto follow. At two o\\'clock we were steaming over the yellow waters of the\\nharbor. The volunteers, like everybody else in Charleston, discussed\\nSecession and Fort Sumter, considering the former as an accomplished\\nfact, and the latter as a fact of the kind called stubborn. They talked\\nuniform, too, and equipments, and marksmanship, and drinks, and cigars,\\nand other military matters. Now and then an awkwardly folded blanket was\\ntaken from the shoulders which it disgraced, refolded, packed carefully\\nin its covering of India-rubber, and strapped once more in its place,\\ntwo or three generally assisting in the operation. Presently a firing at\\nmarks from the upper deck commenced. The favorite target was a conical\\nfloating buoy, showing red on the sunlit surface of the harbor, some\\nfour hundred yards away. With a crack and a hoarse whiz the minie-balls\\nflew towards it, splashing up the water where they first struck and then\\ntaking two or three tremendous skips before they sank. A militiaman from\\nNew York city, who was one of my fellow-passengers, told me that he\\n\"never saw such good shooting.\" It seemed to me that every sixth ball\\neither hit the buoy full, or touched water but a few yards this side of\\nit, while not more than one in a dozen went wild.\\n\\n\"It is good for a thousand yards,\" said a volunteer, slapping his\\nbright, new piece, proudly.\\n\\nA favorite subject of argument appeared to be whether Fort Sumter ought\\nto be attacked immediately or not. A lieutenant standing near me talked\\nlong and earnestly regarding this matter with a civilian friend,\\nbreaking out at last in a loud tone,--\\n\\n\"Why, good Heaven, Jim! do you want that place to go peaceably into the\\nhands of Lincoln?\"\\n\\n\"No, Fred, I do not. But I tell you, Fred, when that fort is attacked,\\nit will be the bloodiest day,--the bloodiest day!--the bloodiest----!!\"\\n\\nAnd here, unable to express himself in words, Jim flung his arms wildly\\nabout, ground his tobacco with excitement, spit on all sides, and walked\\naway, shaking his head, I thought, in real grief of spirit.\\n\\nWe passed close to Fort Pinckney, our volunteers exchanging hurrahs with\\nthe garrison. It is a round, two-storied, yellow little fortification,\\nstanding at one end of a green marsh known as Shute\\'s Folly Island.\\nWhat it was put there for no one knows: it is too close to the city to\\nprotect it; too much out of the harbor to command that. Perhaps it might\\nkeep reinforcements for Anderson from coming down the Ashley, just as\\nthe guns on the Battery were supposed to be intended to deter them from\\ndescending the Cooper.\\n\\nOn the wharf of the ferry three drunken volunteers, the first that I had\\nseen in that condition, brushed against me. The nearest one, a handsome\\nyoung fellow of six feet two, half turned to stare back at me with a--\\n\\n\"How are ye, Cap\\'m? Gaw damn ye! Haw, haw, aw!\"--and reeled onward,\\nbrimful of spirituous good-nature.\\n\\nFour days more had I in Charleston, waiting from tide to tide for a\\nchance to sail to New York, and listening from hour to hour for the guns\\nof Fort Sumter. Sunday was a day of excitement, a report spreading that\\nthe Floridians had attacked Fort Pickens, and the Charlestonians feeling\\nconsequently bound in honor to fight their own dragon. Groups of earnest\\nmen talked all day and late into the evening under the portico and in\\nthe basement-rooms of the hotel, besides gathering at the corners and\\nstrolling about the Battery. \"We must act.\" \"We cannot delay.\" \"We ought\\nnot to submit.\" Such were the phrases that fell upon the ear oftenest\\nand loudest.\\n\\nAs I lounged, after tea, in the vestibule of the reading-room, an\\neccentric citizen of Arkansas varied the entertainment. A short, thin\\nman, of the cracker type, swarthy, long-bearded, and untidy, he was\\ndressed in well-worn civilian costume, with the exception of an old\\nblue coat showing dim remnants of military garniture. Heeling up to a\\ngentleman who sat near me, he glared stupidly at him from beneath a\\nbroad-brimmed hat, demanding a seat mutely, but with such eloquence of\\noscillation that no words were necessary. The respectable person thus\\naddressed, not anxious to receive the stranger into his lap, rose and\\nwalked away, with that air of not, having seen anything so common to\\ndisconcerted people who wish to conceal their disturbance. Into the\\nvacant place dropped the stranger, stretching out his feet, throwing\\nhis head back against the wall, and half closing his eyes with the\\ndrunkard\\'s own leer of self-sufficiency. During a few moments of\\nagonizing suspense the world waited. Then from those whiskey-scorched\\nand tobacco-stained lips came a long, shrill \"Yee-p!\"\\n\\nIt was his exordium; it demanded the attention of the company; and\\nthough he had it not, he continued:--\\n\\n\"I\\'m an Arkansas man, _I_ am. I\\'m a big su-gar planter, _I_ am. All\\nright! Go a\\'ead! I own fifty <DW65>s, _I_ do. Yee-p!\"\\n\\nHe lifted both feet and slammed them on the floor energetically, pausing\\nfor a reply. He had addressed all men; no one responded, and he went\\non:--\\n\\n\"I\\'m for straightout, immedit shession, _I_ am. I go for \\'staining\\ncoursh of Sou\\' Car\\'lina, _I_ do. I\\'m ready to fight for Sou\\' Car\\'lina.\\nI\\'m a Na-po-le-on Bonaparte. All right! Go a\\'ead! Yee-p! Fellahs don\\'t\\nknow me here. I\\'m an Arkansas man, I am. Sou\\' Car\\'lina won\\'t kill an\\nArkansas man. I\\'m an immedit shessionist. Hurrah for Sou\\' Car\\'lina! All\\nright! Yee-p!\"\\n\\nThere was a lingering, caressing accent on his \"_I_ am,\" which told how\\ndear to him was his individuality, drunk or sober. He looked at no one;\\nhis hat was drawn over his eyes; his hands were deep in his pockets;\\nhis feet did all needful gesturing. I stepped in front of him to get\\na fuller view of his face, and the action aroused his attention. He\\nsurveyed my gray Inverness wrapper and gave me a chuckling nod of\\napprobation.\\n\\n\"How are ye, Bub? I like that blanket, _I_ do.\"\\n\\nIn spite of this noble stranger\\'s goodwill and prowess, we still found\\nFort Sumter a knotty question. In a country which for eighty years has\\nnot seen a shot fired in earnest, it is not wonderful that a good\\ndeal of ignorance should exist concerning military matters, and\\nthat second-class plans should be hatched for taking a first-class\\nfortification. While I was in Charleston, the most popular proposition\\nwas to bombard continuously for two whole days and nights, thereby\\ndemoralizing the garrison by depriving it of sleep and causing it to\\nsurrender at the first attempt to escalade. Another plan, not in general\\nfavor, was to smoke Anderson out by means of a raft covered with burning\\nmixtures of a chemical and bad-smelling nature. Still another, with\\nperhaps yet fewer adherents, was to advance on all sides in such a vast\\nnumber of row-boats that the fort could not sink them all, whereupon\\nthe survivors should land on the wharf and proceed to take such further\\nmeasures as might be deemed expedient. The volunteers from the country\\nalways arrived full of faith and defiance. \"We want to get a squint at\\nthat Fort Sumter,\" they would say to their city friends. \"We are going\\nto take it. If we don\\'t plant the palmetto on it, it\\'s because there\\'s\\nno such tree as the palmetto.\" Down the harbor they would go in the\\nferry-boats to Morris or Sullivan\\'s Island. The spy-glass would be\\nbrought out, and one after another would peer through it at the object\\nof their enmity. Some could not sight it at all, confounded the\\ninstrument, and fell back on their natural vision. Others, more lucky,\\nor better versed in telescopic observations, got a view of the fortress,\\nand perhaps burst out swearing at the evident massiveness of the walls\\nand the size of the columbiads.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, what a gun!\" exclaimed one man. \"D\\'ye see that gun? What an\\nalmighty thing! I\\'ll be ----, if I ever put my head in front of it!\"\\n\\nThe difficulties of assault were admitted to be very great, considering\\nthe bad footing, the height of the ramparts, and the abundant store of\\nmuskets and grenades in the garrison. As to breaches, nobody seemed to\\nknow whether they could be made or not. The besieging batteries were\\nneither heavy nor near, nor could they be advanced as is usual in\\nregular sieges, nor had they any advantage over the defence except in\\nthe number of gunners, while in regard to position and calibre they were\\ninferior. To knock down a wall nearly forty feet high and fourteen feet\\nthick at a distance of more than half a mile seemed a tough undertaking,\\neven when unresisted. It was discovered also that the side of the\\nfortification towards Fort Johnstone, its only weak point, had been\\nstrengthened so as to make it bomb-proof by means of interior masonry\\nconstructed from the stones of the landing-place. Then nobody wanted to\\nknock Fort Sumter down, inasmuch as that involved either the labor\\nof building it up again, or the necessity of going without it as a\\nharbor-defence. Finally, suppose it should be attacked and not taken?\\nReally, we unlearned people in the art of war were vastly puzzled as we\\nthought tins whole matter over, and we sometimes doubted whether our\\nsuperiors were not almost equally bothered with ourselves.\\n\\nThis fighting was a sober, sad subject; and yet at times it took a turn\\ntoward the ludicrous. A gentleman told me that he was present when the\\nsteamer Marion was seized with the intention of using her in pursuing\\nthe Star of the West. A vehement dispute arose as to the fitness of the\\nvessel for military service.\\n\\n\"Fill her with men, and put two or three eighteen-pounders in her,\" said\\nthe advocates of the measure.\\n\\n\"Where will you put your eighteen-pounders?\" demanded the opposition.\\n\\n\"On the promenade-deck, to be sure.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and the moment you fire one, you\\'ll see it go through the bottom\\nof the ship, and then you\\'ll have to go after it.\"\\n\\nDuring the two days previous to my second and successful attempt to quit\\nCharleston, the city was in full expectation that the fort would shortly\\nbe attacked. News had arrived that Federal troops were on their way with\\nreinforcements. An armed steamer had been seen off the harbor, both by\\nnight and day, making signals to Anderson. The Governor went down\\nto Sullivan\\'s Island to inspect the troops and Fort Moultrie. The\\nvolunteers, aided by <DW64>s and even <DW64> women, worked all night on\\nthe batteries. Notwithstanding we were close upon race-week, when the\\ncity is usually crowded, the streets had a deserted air, and nearly\\nevery acquaintance I met told me he had been down to the islands to\\nsee the preparations. Yet the whole excitement, like others which had\\npreceded, ended even short of smoke. News came that reinforcements had\\nnot been sent to Anderson; and the destruction of that most inconvenient\\nperson was once more postponed. People fell back on the old hope that\\nthe Government would be brought to listen to reason,--that it would\\ngive up to South Carolina what it could not keep from her with justice,\\n--that it would grant, in short, the incontrovertible right of peaceable\\nsecession. For, in the midst of all these labors and terrors, this\\nexpense and annoyance, no one talked of returning into the Union, and\\nall agreed in deprecating compromise.\\n\\nOnce more, this time in the James Adger, I set sail from Charleston. The\\nboat lost one tide, and consequently one day, because at the last\\nmoment the captain found himself obliged to take out a South Carolina\\nclearance. As I passed down the harbor, I counted fourteen square-rigged\\nvessels at the wharves, and one lying at anchor, while three others had\\njust passed the bar, outward-bound, and two were approaching from the\\nopen sea. Deterred from the Ship Channel by the sunken schooners, and\\nfrom Maffitt\\'s Channel by the fate of the Columbia, we tried the Middle\\nChannel, and glided over the bar without accident.\\n\\n\"Sailing to Charleston is very much like going foreign,\" I said to a\\nmiddle-aged sea-captain whom we numbered among our passengers. \"What\\nwith heaving the lead, and doing without beacons, and lying off the\\ncoast o\\' nights, it makes one think of trading to new countries.\"\\n\\nI had, it seems, unintentionally pulled the string which jerked him.\\nSpringing up, he paced about excitedly for a few moments, and then broke\\nout with his story.\\n\\n\"Yes,--I know it,--I know as much about it as anybody, I reckon. I lay\\noff there nine days in a nor\\'easter and lost my anchors; and here I am\\ngoing on to New York to buy some more; and all for those cursed Black\\nRepublicans!\"\\n\\nIn South Carolina they see but one side of the shield,--which is quite\\ndifferent, as we know, from the custom of the rest of mankind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.\\n\\n\\n1. _Descriptive Ethnology._ By R.G. LATHAM. 2 vols. London. 1859.\\n\\n2. _Anthropologie der Naturvoelker._ Von Dr. T. WAIZ. 2 Baender. Leipzig.\\n1860.\\n\\nSome writers have the remarkable faculty of making the subject which\\nthey may happen to treat forever more distasteful and wearisome to their\\nreaders. Whether the cause be in the style, or the point of view, or\\nthe method of treatment, or in all together, they seem able to force the\\nstudent away in disgust from the whole field on which they labor, with\\nvows never again to cross it.\\n\\nSuch an author, it seems to us, is pre-eminently R.G. Latham, in his\\ntreatment of Ethnology. Happy the man who has any such philosophic\\ninterest in Human Races, that he can ever care to hear again of the\\nsubject, after perusing Mr. Latham\\'s various volumes on \"Descriptive\\nEthnology.\" We wonder that the whole English reading public; has not\\nconsigned the science to the shelf of Encyclopedias of Useful Knowledge,\\nor of Year-Books of Fact, or any other equally philosophic and connected\\nworks, after the treatment which this modern master of Ethnology has\\ngiven to the subject.\\n\\nSuch disconnected masses of facts are heaped together in these works,\\nsuch incredible dulness is shown in presenting them, such careful\\navoidance of any generalization or of any interesting particular, such\\na bald and conceited style, and such a cockneyish and self-opinionated\\nview of human history, as our soul wearies even to think of. Mr. Latham\\ndisdains any link of philosophy, or any classification, among his \"ten\\nthousand facts,\" as being a fault of the \"German School\" (whatever that\\nmay be) of Ethnology. It seems to him soundly \"British\" to disbelieve\\nall the best conclusions of modern scholarship, and to urge his own\\nfanciful or shallow theories. He treats all human superstitions and\\nmythologies as if he were standing in the Strand and judging them by the\\nideas of modern London. His is a Cockney\\'s view of antiquity. He cannot\\nimagine that a barbarous and infant people, groping in the mysteries of\\nthe moral universe, might entertain some earnest and poetic views which\\nwere not precisely in the line of thought of the Londoners of the\\nnineteenth century, and yet which might be worth investigating. To his\\nmind, there is no grand march of humanity, slow, but certain, towards\\nhigher ideals, through the various lines of race,--but rather\\ninnumerable ripples on the surface of history, which come and pass away\\nwithout connection and without purpose.\\n\\nThe reader wades slowly through his books, and leaves them with a\\nfeeling of intense disgust. Such a vast gathering of facts merely to\\nproduce this melancholy confusion of details! You feel that his eminence\\nin the science must be from the circumstance that no one else is dull\\nenough and patient enough to gather such a museum of facts in regard\\nto human beings. The mind is utterly confused as to divisions of human\\nraces, and is ready to conclude that there must be almost as many\\nvarieties of man as there are tribes or dialects, and that Ethnology has\\nnot yet reached the position of a science.\\n\\nThe reader must pardon the bitterness of our feelings; but we are just\\nsmarting from a prolonged perusal of all Mr. Latham\\'s works, especially\\nthe two volumes whose title is given above; and that we may have\\nsympathy, if only in a faint degree, from our friends, we quote a few\\npassages, taken at random, though we cannot possibly thus convey an\\nadequate conception of the infinite dulness of the work.\\n\\nThe following is his elegant introduction:--\\n\\n  \"I follow the Horatian rule, and plunge, at\\n  once, _in medias res_. I am on the Indus, but\\n  not on the Indian portion of it. I am on the\\n  Himalayas, but not on their southern side. I\\n  am on the northwestern ranges, with Tartary\\n  on the north, Bokhara on the west, and Hindostan\\n  on the south. I am in a neighborhood\\n  where three great religions meet: Mahometanism,\\n  Buddhism. Brahminism. I _must_ begin\\n  somewhere; and here is my beginning.\"--\\n  Vol. i. p. 1.\\n\\nThe following is his analysis of the beautiful Finnish Kalevala:--\\n\\n\"Wainamoinen is much of a smith, and more of a harper. Illmarinen is\\nmost of a smith. Lemminkainen is much of a harper, and little of a\\nsmith. The hand of the daughter of the mistress of Pohjola is what, each\\nand all, the three sons of Kalevala strive to win,--a hand which the\\nmother of the owner will give to any one who can make for her and\\nfor Pohjola _Sampo_, Wainamoinen will not; but he knows of one who\\nwill,--Illmarinen. Illmarinen makes it, and gains the mother\\'s consent\\nthereby. But the daughter requires another service. He must hunt down\\nthe elk of Tunela. We now see the way in which the actions of the heroes\\nare, at one and the same time, separate and connected. Wainamoinen\\ntries; Illmarinen tries (and eventually wins); Lemminkainen tries. There\\nare alternations of friendship and enmity. Sampo is made and presented.\\nIt is then wanted back again.\\n\\n\"\\'Give us,\\' says Wainamoinen, \\'if not the whole, half.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Sampo,\\' says Louki, the mistress of Pohjola,\\' cannot be divided.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Then let us steal it,\\' says one of the three.\\n\\n\"\\'Agreed,\\' say the other two.\\n\\n\"So the rape of Sampo takes place. It is taken from Pohjola, whilst the\\nowners are sung to sleep by the harp of Lemminkainen; sung to sleep,\\nbut not for so long a time as to allow the robbers to escape. They are\\nsailing Kalevalaward, when Louki comes after them on the wings of the\\nwind, and raises a storm. Sampo is broken, and thrown into the sea. Bad\\ndays now come. There is no sun, no moon. Illmarinen makes them of silver\\nand gold. He had previously made his second wife (for he lost his first)\\nout of the same metals. However, Sampo is washed up, and made whole.\\nGood days come. The sun and moon shine as before, and the sons of\\nKalevala possess Sampo.\"--Vol. i., pp. 433, 434.\\n\\nThis, again, is Mr. Latham\\'s profound and interesting view of\\n_Buddhism:--_\\n\\n\"Buddhism is one thing. Practices out of which Buddhism may be developed\\nare another. It has been already suggested that the ideas conveyed by\\nthe terms _Sramanoe_ and _Gymnosophistoe_ are just as Brahminic as\\nBuddhist, and, _vice versa_, just as Buddhist as Brahminic.\\n\\n\"The earliest dates of specific Buddhism are of the same age as the\\nearliest dates of specific Brahminism.\\n\\n\"Clemens of Alexandria mentions Buddhist pyramids, the Buddhist habit of\\ndepositing certain bones in them, the Buddhist practice of foretelling\\nevents, the Buddhist practice of continence, the Buddhist Semnai or holy\\nvirgins. This, however, may he but so much asceticism. He mentions this\\nand more. He supplies the name Bouta; Bouta being honored as a god.\\n\\n\"From Cyril of Jerusalem we learn that Samnaism was, more or less,\\nManichaean,--Manichaeanism being, more or less, Samanist. Terebinthus,\\nthe preceptor of Manes, took the name Baudas. In Epiphanius, Terebinthus\\nis the pupil of Scythianus.\\n\\n\"Suidas makes Terebinthus a pupil of Baudda, who pretended to be the\\nson of a virgin. And here we may stop to remark, that the Mongol\\nTshingiz-Khan is said to be virgin-born; that, word for word, Scythianus\\nis Sak; that Sakya Muni (compare it with Manes) is a name of Buddha.\\n\\n\"Be this as it may, there was, before A.D. 300,--\\n\\n  \"1. Action and reaction between Buddhism\\n  and Christianity.\\n\\n  \"2. Buddhist buildings.\\n\\n  \"3. The same cultus in both Bactria and\\n  India.\\n\\n  \"Whether this constitute Buddhism is another\\n  question.\"--Vol. ii. p. 317.\\n\\nAnd more of an equally attractive and comprehensible character.\\n\\nWe assure the reader that these extracts are but feeble exponents of the\\npeculiar power of Mr. Latham\\'s works,--a power of unmitigated dulness.\\nWhat his views are on the great questions of the science--the origin\\nof races, the migrations, the crossings of varieties, and the like--no\\nmortal can remember, who has penetrated the labyrinth of his researches.\\n\\nAn author of a very different kind is Professor Waiz, whose work on\\nAnthropology has just reached this country: a writer as philosophic as\\nMr. Latham is disconnected; as pleasing and natural in style as the\\nother is affected; as simply open to the true and good in all customs or\\nsuperstitions of barbarous peoples as the Englishman is contemptuous of\\neverything not modern and European. Waiz seems to us the most careful\\nand truly scientific author in the field of Ethnology whom we have\\nhad since Prichard, and with the wider scope which belongs to the\\nintellectual German.\\n\\nThe bane of this science, as every one knows, has been its theorizing,\\nand its want of careful inductive reasoning from facts. The\\nclassifications in it have been endless, varying almost with the fancies\\nof each new student; while every prominent follower of it has had some\\npet hypothesis, to which he desired to suit his facts. Whether the\\n_a priori_ theory were of modern miraculous origin or of gradual\\ndevelopment, of unity or of diversity of parentage, of permanent and\\nabsolute divisions of races or of a community of blood, it has equally\\nforced the author to twist his facts.\\n\\nPerhaps the basest of all uses to which theory has been put in this\\nscience was in a well-known American work, where facts and fancies in\\nEthnology were industriously woven together to form another withe about\\nthe limbs of the wretched African slave.\\n\\nWaiz has reasoned slowly and carefully from facts, considering in\\nhis view all possible hypotheses,--even, for instance, the\\ndevelopment-theory of Darwin,--and has formed his own conclusion on\\nscientific data, or has wisely avowed that no conclusion is possible.\\n\\nThe classification to which he is forced is that which all profound\\ninvestigators are approaching,--that of language interpreted by history.\\nHe is compelled to believe that no physiological evidences of race can\\nbe considered as at all equal to the evidences from language. At the\\nsame time, he is ready to admit that even this classification is\\nimperfect, as from the nature of the case it must be; for the source of\\nthe confusion lies in the very unity of mankind. He rejects _in toto_\\nProfessor Agassiz\\'s \"realm-theory,\" as inconsistent with facts. The\\nhybrid-question, as put by Messrs. Gliddon and Nott, meets with a\\nsearching and careful investigation, with the conclusion that nothing\\nin facts yet ascertained proves any want of vitality or power of\\npropagation in mulattoes or in crosses of any human races.\\n\\nThe unity of origin and the vast antiquity of mankind are the two\\nimportant conclusions drawn.\\n\\nHis second volume is entirely devoted to the <DW64> races, and is the\\nmost valuable treatise yet written on that topic.\\n\\nThe whole work is mainly directed towards _Naturvoelker_, or \"Peoples in\\na State of Nature,\" and therefore cannot be recommended for translation,\\nas a general text-book on the science of Ethnology,--a book which is\\nnow exceedingly needed in all our higher schools and colleges; but as\\na general treatise, with many new and important facts, scientifically\\ntreated, it can be most highly commended to the general scholar.\\n\\n\\n_Il Politecnico. Repertorio Mensile di Studi applicati alia Prosperita e\\nColtura Sociale._ Milano, 1860. New York: Charles B. Norton, Agent for\\nLibraries, 596, Broadway.\\n\\nAmong the best first-fruits of Italian liberty are the free publication\\nand circulation of books; and it is a striking indication of the new\\norder of things in Lombardy, that the publishers at Milan of the monthly\\njournal, \"Il Politecnico,\" should at once have established an American\\nagency in New York, and that in successive numbers of their periodical\\nduring the present year they should have furnished lists of some of the\\nprincipal American publications which they are prepared to obtain for\\nItalian readers. It will be a fortunate circumstance for the people of\\nboth countries, should a ready means be established for the interchange\\nof their contemporaneous works in literature and science.\\n\\nThe \"Politecnico\" is not altogether a new journal. Seven volumes of it\\nbad been published, and had acquired for it a high reputation and a\\nconsiderable circulation, when political events put a stop to its\\nissue. The Austrian system of government after 1849 repressed alt free\\nexpression of thought in Lombardy; and no encouragement was afforded for\\nthe publication of any work not under the control of the administration.\\nWith the beginning of the present year the \"Politecnico\" was\\nreestablished, mainly through the influence and under the direction of\\nDr. Carlo Cattaneo, who had been the chief promoter of the preceding\\noriginal series. The numbers of the new series give evidence of talent\\nand independence in its conductors and contributors, and contain\\narticles of intrinsic value, beside that which they possess as\\nindications of the present intellectual condition and tendencies of\\nItaly. The journal is wholly devoted to serious studies, its object\\nbeing the cultivation of the moral and physical sciences with the arts\\ndepending on them, and their practical application to promote the\\nnational prosperity. That it will carry out its design with ability is\\nguarantied by the character of Cattaneo.\\n\\nCarlo Cattaneo is a man of unquestioned power of intellect, of strong\\ncharacter, and resolute energy. Already distinguished, not only as a\\npolitical economist, but as a forcible reasoner in applied politics, he\\ntook a leading part in the struggle of 1848 in Milan, and, inspired by\\nill-will towards Charles Albert and the Piedmontese, was one of the\\npromoters of the disastrous Lombard policy which defeated the hopes of\\nthe opponents of Austria at that day. Though an Italian liberal, and\\nunquestionably honest in his patriotic intentions, he was virtually an\\nally of Radetzky. When the Austrians retook Milan, he was compelled to\\nfly, and took refuge in Lugano, where he compiled three large volumes\\non the affairs of Italy, from the accession of Pius IX. to the fall of\\nVenice, in which he exhibited his political views, endeavoring to show\\nthat the misfortunes of Lombardy were due to the ambitious and false\\npolicy of the unhappy Charles Albert. His distrust of the Piedmontese\\nhas not diminished with the recent changes in the affairs of Italy; and\\nalthough Lombardy is now united to Piedmont, and the hope of freedom\\nseems to lie in a hearty and generous union of men of all parties in\\nsupport of the new government, Cattaneo, when in March last he was\\nelected a member of the National Parliament, refused to take his seat,\\nthat he might not be obliged to swear allegiance to the King and the\\nConstitution. His political desire seems to be to see Italy not brought\\nunder one rule, but composed of a union of states, each preserving\\nits special autonomy. He is a federalist, and does not share in the\\nunitarian view which prevails with almost all the other prominent\\nItalian statesmen, and which at this moment appears to be the only\\nsystem that can create a strong, united, independent Italy. It was to\\nhim, perhaps, more than to any other single man, that the difficulties\\nwhich lately arose in the settling of the mode of annexation of Sicily\\nand Naples to the Sardinian kingdom were due; and the small party in\\nParliament which recently refused to join in the vote of confidence in\\nthe ministry of Cavour was led by Ferrari, the disciple of the Milanese\\nDoctor.\\n\\nBut however impracticable Cattaneo may be, and however mistaken and\\nextravagant his political views, he is a man of such vigor of mind, that\\na journal conducted by him becomes, from the fact of his connection with\\nit, one of the important organs of Italian thought. We trust that the\\n\"Politecnico\" will find subscribers among those in our country who\\ndesire to keep up their knowledge of Italian affairs at a time of such\\nextraordinary interest as the present.\\n\\n\\n_Elsie Venner_. A Romance of Destiny. By OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 2 vols.\\nBoston: Ticknor & Fields. 1861.\\n\\nEnglish literature numbers among its more or less distinguished authors\\na goodly number of physicians. Sir Thomas Browne was, perhaps, the\\nlast of the great writers of English prose whose mind and style were\\nimpregnated with imagination. He wrote poetry without meaning it, as\\nmany of his brother doctors have meant to write poetry without doing it,\\nin the classic style of\\n\\n  \"Inoculation, heavenly maid, descend!\"\\n\\nGarth\\'s \"Dispensary\" was long ago as fairly buried as any of his\\npatients; and Armstrong\\'s \"Health\" enjoys the dreary immortality of\\nbeing preserved in the collections, like one of those queer things they\\nshow you in a glass jar at the anatomical museums. Arbuthnot, a truly\\ngenial humorist, has hardly had justice done him. People laugh over his\\nfun in the \"Memoirs of Scriblerus,\" and are commonly satisfied to think\\nit Pope\\'s. Smollett insured his literary life in \"Humphrey Clinker\";\\nand we suppose his Continuation of Hume is still one of the pills which\\ningenuous youth is expected to gulp before it is strong enough to\\nresist. Goldsmith\\'s fame has steadily gained; and so has that of Keats,\\nwhom we may also fairly reckon in our list, though he remained harmless,\\nhaving never taken a degree. On the whole, the proportion of doctors who\\nhave positively succeeded in our literature is a large one, and we\\nhave now another very marked and beautiful case in Dr. Holmes. Since\\nArbuthnot, the profession has produced no such wit; since Goldsmith, no\\nauthor so successful.\\n\\nFive years ago it would have been only Dr. Holmes\\'s intimate friends\\nthat would have considered the remarkable success he has achieved not\\nonly possible, but probable. They knew, that, if the fitting opportunity\\nshould only come, he would soon show how much stuff he had in\\nhim,--sterner stuff, too, than the world had supposed,--stuff not\\nmerely to show off the iris of a brilliant reputation, but to block out\\ninto the foundations of an enduring fame. It seems an odd thing to say\\nthat Dr. Holmes had suffered by having given proof of too much wit; but\\nit is undoubtedly true. People in general have a great respect for those\\nwho scare them or make them cry, but are apt to weigh lightly one who\\namuses them. They like to be tickled, but they would hardly take the\\nadvice of their tickler on any question they thought serious. We have\\nour doubts whether the majority of those who make up what is called \"the\\nworld\" are fond of wit. It rather puts them out, as Nature did Fuseli:\\nThey look on its crinkling play as men do at lightning; and while they\\ngrant it is very fine, are teased with an uncomfortable wonder as to\\nwhere it is going to strike next. They would rather, on the whole,\\nit were farther off. They like well-established jokes, the fine old\\nsmoked-herring sort, such as the clown offers them in the circus,\\nwarranted never to spoil, if only kept dry enough. Your fresh wit\\ndemands a little thought, perhaps, or at least a kind of negative wit,\\nin the recipient. It is an active, meddlesome--quality, forever putting\\nthings in unexpected and somewhat startling relations to each other;\\nand such new relations are as unwelcome to the ordinary mind as poor\\nrelations to a _nouveau riche_. Who wants to be all the time painfully\\nconceiving of the antipodes walking like flies on the ceiling? Yet wit\\nis related to some of the profoundest qualities of the intellect. It is\\nthe reasoning faculty acting _per saltum_, the sense of analogy brought\\nto a focus; it is generalization in a flash, logic by the electric\\ntelegraph, the sense of likeness in unlikeness, that lies at the root\\nof all discoveries; it is the prose imagination, common-sense at fourth\\nproof. All this is no reason why the world should like it, however; and\\nwe fancy that the Question, _Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?_ was\\nplaintively put in the primitive tongue by one of the world\\'s gray\\nfathers to another without producing the slightest conviction. Of\\ncourse, there must be some reason for this suspicion of wit, as there\\nis for most of the world\\'s deep-rooted prejudices. There is a kind of\\nsurface-wit that is commonly the sign of a light and shallow nature.\\nIt becomes habitual _persiflage_, incapable of taking a deliberate and\\nserious view of anything, or of conceiving the solemnities that environ\\nlife. This has made men distrustful of all laughers; and they are apt to\\nconfound in one sweeping condemnation with this that humor whose base\\nis seriousness, and which is generally the rebound of the mind from\\nover-sad contemplation. They do not see that the same qualities that\\nmake Shakspeare the greatest of tragic poets make him also the deepest\\nof humorists.\\n\\nDr. Holmes was already an author of more than a quarter of a century\\'s\\nstanding, and was looked on by most people as an _amusing_ writer\\nmerely. He protested playfully and pointedly against this, once or\\ntwice; but, as he could not help being witty, whether he would or no,\\nhis audience laughed and took the protest as part of the joke. He felt\\nthat he was worth a great deal more than he was vulgarly rated at, and\\nperhaps chafed a little; but his opportunity had not come. With the\\nfirst number of the \"Atlantic\" it came at last, and wonderfully he\\nprofited by it. The public were first delighted, and then astonished. So\\nmuch wit, wisdom, pathos, and universal Catharine-wheeling of fun and\\nfancy was unexampled. \"Why, good gracious,\" cried Madam Grundy, \"we\\'ve\\ngot a _genius_ among us fit last! I always knew what it would'"
