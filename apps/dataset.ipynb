Compiled by the Gentlemen of the\\nInner Temple, and by them presented before her Maiestie. Newly reuiued\\nand polished according to the decorum of these daies. By R.W. London,\\nPrinted by Thomas Scarlet, and are to be solde by R. Robinson, 1591,\\n4to.\\n\\n[Some copies are dated 1592; but there was only a single edition. Of the\\noriginal text, as written in 1568, there is no printed copy; but MSS. of\\nit are in MS. Lansdowne 786, and Hargrave MS. 205, neither of which\\nappears to present any evidence of identity with the copy mentioned by\\nIsaac Reed below as then in private hands. Both these MSS. have now been\\ncollated with the text of 1591, and the conclusion must be, that Wilmot,\\nthough he unquestionably revived, did not do so much, as he might wish\\nto have it inferred, in _polishing_ the play. The production was formed\\non a classical model, and bears marks of resemblance in tone and style\\nto the \"Jocasta\" of Euripides, as paraphrased by Gascoigne in 1566. The\\nLansdowne MS. of \"Tancred and Gismunda\" was written, about 1568-70,\\nwhile the Hargrave is much more modern.]\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nIt appears from William Webbe\\'s Epistle prefixed to this piece, that\\nafter its first exhibition it was laid aside, and at some distance of\\ntime was new-written by R. Wilmot. The reader, therefore, may not be\\ndispleased with a specimen of it in its original dress. It is here given\\nfrom the fragment of an ancient MS. taken out of a chest of papers\\nformerly belonging to Mr Powell, father-in-law to the author of\\n\"Paradise Lost,\" at Forest Hill, about four miles from Oxford, where in\\nall probability some curiosities of the same kind may remain, the\\ncontents of these chests (for I think there are more than one) having\\nnever yet been properly examined. The following extract is from the\\nconclusion of the piece.--_Reed_. [Reed\\'s extract has been collated with\\nthe two MSS. before-mentioned; where the Powell MS. may now be, the\\neditor cannot say. The differences, on the whole, are not material;\\nbut the Lansdowne MS. 786 has supplied a few superior readings and\\ncorrections.]\\n\\n    But in thy brest if eny spark remaine\\n    Of thy dere love.

It was the production\\nof five gentlemen, who were probably students of that society; and by\\none of them, Robert Wilmot, afterwards much altered and published in the\\nyear 1591.[1] [Wilmot had meanwhile become rector of North Okenham, in\\nEssex];[2] and in his Dedication to the Societies of the Inner and\\nMiddle Temples, he speaks of the censure which might be cast upon him\\nfrom the indecorum of publishing a dramatic work arising from his\\ncalling. When he died, or whether he left any other works, are points\\nequally uncertain.\\n\\n\"Nearly a century after the date of that play,\" observes Lamb, in his\\n\\'Extracts from the Garrick Plays,\\' \"Dryden produced his admirable\\nversion of the same story from Boccaccio. The speech here extracted\\n(the scene between the messengers and Gismunda) may be compared with\\nthe corresponding passage in the \\'Sigismunda and Guiscardo\\' with no\\ndisadvantage to the older performance. It is quite as weighty, as\\npointed, and as passionate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n  To the Right Worshipful and Virtuous Ladies, the Lady MARY PETER\\n  and the Lady ANNE GRAY, long health of body, with quiet of mind,\\n  in the favour of God and men for ever.\\n\\nIt is most certain (right virtuous and worshipful) that of all human\\nlearning, poetry (how contemptible soever it is in these days) is the\\nmost ancient; and, in poetry, there is no argument of more antiquity and\\nelegancy than is the matter of love; for it seems to be as old as the\\nworld, and to bear date from the first time that man and woman was:\\ntherefore in this, as in the finest metal, the freshest wits have in all\\nages shown their best workmanship. So amongst others these gentlemen,\\nwhich with what sweetness of voice and liveliness of action they then\\nexpressed it, they which were of her Majesty\\'s right Honourable maidens\\ncan testify.\\n\\nWhich being a discourse of two lovers, perhaps it may seem a thing\\nneither fit to be offered unto your ladyships, nor worthy me to busy\\nmyself withal: yet can I tell you, madames, it differeth so far from the\\nordinary amorous discourses of our days, as the manners of our time do\\nfrom the modesty and innocency of that age.\\n\\nAnd now for that weary winter is come upon us, which bringeth with him\\ndrooping days and tedious nights, if it be true, that the motions of our\\nminds follow the temperature of the air wherein we live, then I think\\nthe perusing of some mournful matter, tending to the view of a notable\\nexample, will refresh your wits in a gloomy day, and ease your weariness\\nof the louring night. Which if it please you, may serve ye also for a\\nsolemn revel against this festival time, for _Gismund\\'s_ bloody shadow,\\nwith a little cost, may be entreated in her self-like person to speak\\nto ye.\\n\\nHaving therefore a desire to be known to your W., I devised this way\\nwith myself to procure the same, persuading myself, there is nothing\\nmore welcome to your wisdoms than the knowledge of wise, grave, and\\nworthy matters, tending to the good instructions of youths, of whom you\\nare mothers.\\n\\nIn this respect, therefore, I shall humbly desire ye to bestow a\\nfavourable countenance upon this little labour, which when ye have\\ngraced it withal, I must and will acknowledge myself greatly indebted\\nunto your ladyships in this behalf: neither shall I amongst the rest,\\nthat admire your rare virtues (which are not a few in Essex), cease to\\ncommend this undeserved gentleness.\\n\\nThus desiring the king of heaven to increase his graces in ye both,\\ngranting that your ends may be as honourable as your lives are\\nvirtuous, I leave with a vain babble of many needless words to trouble\\nyou longer.\\n\\n             Your Worships\\' most dutiful\\n                             and humble Orator,\\n                                 ROBERT WILMOT.\\n\\n\\n\\nTO HIS FRIEND R.W.\\n\\nMaster R.W., look not now for the terms of an intreater: I will beg no\\nlonger; and for your promises, I will refuse them as bad payment:\\nneither can I be satisfied with anything but a peremptory performance of\\nan old intention of yours, the publishing I mean of those waste papers\\n(as it pleaseth you to call them, but, as I esteem them, a most\\nexquisite invention) of Gismund\\'s tragedy. Think not to shift me off\\nwith longer delays, nor allege more excuses to get further respite, lest\\nI arrest you with my _actum est_, and commence such a suit of unkindness\\nagainst you, as when the case shall be scann\\'d before the judges of\\ncourtesy, the court will cry out of your immoderate modesty. And thus\\nmuch I tell you before: you shall not be able to wage against me in the\\ncharges growing upon this action, especially if the worshipful company\\nof the Inner-Temple gentlemen patronise my cause, as undoubtedly they\\nwill, yea, and rather plead partially for me, than let my cause\\nmiscarry, because themselves are parties. The tragedy was by them most\\npithily framed, and no less curiously acted in view of her Majesty, by\\nwhom it was then as princely accepted, as of the whole honourable\\naudience notably applauded: yea, and of all men generally desired, as a\\nwork, either in stateliness of show, depth of conceit, or true ornaments\\nof poetical art, inferior to none of the best in that kind: no, were the\\nRoman Seneca the censurer. The brave youths that then (to their high\\npraises) so feelingly performed the same in action, did shortly after\\nlay up the book unregarded, or perhaps let it run abroad (as many\\nparents do their children once past dandling) not respecting so much\\nwhat hard fortune might befall it being out of their fingers, as how\\ntheir heroical wits might again be quickly conceived have been ever\\nsince wonderful fertile. But this orphan of theirs (for he wand\\'reth as\\nit were fatherless) hath notwithstanding, by the rare and beautiful\\nperfections appearing in him, hitherto never wanted great favourers and\\nloving preservers. Among whom I cannot sufficiently commend your\\ncharitable zeal and scholarly compassion towards him, that have not only\\nrescued and defended him from the devouring jaws of oblivion, but\\nvouchsafed also to apparel him in a new suit at your own charges,\\nwherein he may again more boldly come abroad, and by your permission\\nreturn to his old parents, clothed perhaps not in richer or more costly\\nfurniture than it went from them, but in handsomeness and fashion more\\nanswerable to these times, wherein fashions are so often altered. Let\\none word suffice for your encouragement herein; namely, that your\\ncommendable pains in disrobing him of his antique curiosity, and\\nadorning him with the approved guise of our stateliest English terms\\n(not diminishing, but more augmenting his artificial colours of absolute\\npoesy, derived from his first parents) cannot but be grateful to most\\nmen\\'s appetites, who upon our experience we know highly to esteem such\\nlofty measures of sententiously composed tragedies.\\n\\nHow much you shall make me and the rest of your private friends beholden\\nto you, I list not to discourse: and therefore grounding upon these\\nalleged reasons; that the suppressing of this tragedy, so worthy for the\\npress, were no other thing than wilfully to defraud yourself of an\\nuniversal thank, your friends of their expectations, and sweet Gismund\\nof a famous eternity, I will cease to doubt of any other pretence to\\ncloak your bashfulness, hoping to read it in print (which lately lay\\nneglected amongst your papers) at our next appointed meeting.\\n\\nI bid you heartily farewell. From Pyrgo in Essex, August the eighth,\\n1591.\\n\\n      _Tuus fide & facultate_\\n\\n                     GUIL. WEBBE.[3]\\n\\n\\n\\n  To the Worshipful and Learned Society, the GENTLEMEN STUDENTS of\\n  the Inner Temple, with the rest of his singular good Friends, the\\n  GENTLEMEN of the Middle Temple, and to all other courteous Readers,\\n  R.W. wisheth increase of all health, worship, and learning, with\\n  the immortal glory of the graces adorning the same.\\n\\nYe may perceive (right Worshipful) in perusing the former epistle sent\\nto me, how sore I am beset with the importunities of my friends to\\npublish this pamphlet: truly I am and have been (if there be in me any\\nsoundness of judgment) of this opinion, that whatsoever is committed to\\nthe press is commended to eternity, and it shall stand a lively witness\\nwith our conscience, to our comfort or confusion, in the reckoning of\\nthat great day.\\n\\nAdvisedly, therefore, was that proverb used of our elder philosophers,\\n_Manum a tabula_: withhold thy hand from the paper, and thy papers from\\nthe print or light of the world: for a lewd word escaped is irrevocable,\\nbut a bad or base discourse published in print is intolerable.\\n\\nHereupon I have endured some conflicts between reason and judgment,\\nwhether it were convenient for the commonwealth, with the _indecorum_ of\\nmy calling (as some think it) that the memory of Tancred\\'s tragedy\\nshould be again by my means revived, which the oftener I read over, and\\nthe more I considered thereon, the sooner I was won to consent\\nthereunto: calling to mind that neither the thrice reverend and learned\\nfather, M. Beza, was ashamed in his younger years to send abroad, in his\\nown name, his tragedy of \"Abraham,\"[4] nor that rare Scot (the scholar\\nof our age) Buchanan, his most pathetical Jephtha.\\n\\nIndeed I must willingly confess this work simple, and not worth\\ncomparison to any of theirs: for the writers of them were grave men; of\\nthis, young heads: in them is shown the perfection of their studies; in\\nthis, the imperfection of their wits. Nevertheless herein they all\\nagree, commending virtue, detesting vice, and lively deciphering their\\noverthrow that suppress not their unruly affections. These things noted\\nherein, how simple soever the verse be, I hope the matter will be\\nacceptable to the wise.\\n\\nWherefore I am now bold to present Gismund to your sights, and unto\\nyours only, for therefore have I conjured her, by the love that hath\\nbeen these twenty-four years betwixt us, that she wax not so proud of\\nher fresh painting, to straggle in her plumes abroad, but to contain\\nherself within the walls of your house; so am I sure she shall be safe\\nfrom the _tragedian tyrants_ of our time, who are not ashamed to affirm\\nthat there can no amorous poem savour of any sharpness of wit, unless it\\nbe seasoned with scurrilous words.\\n\\nBut leaving them to their lewdness, I hope you, and all discreet\\nreaders, will thankfully receive my pains, the fruits of my first\\nharvest: the rather, perceiving that my purpose in this tragedy tendeth\\nonly to the exaltation of virtue and suppression of vice, with pleasure\\nto profit and help all men, but to offend or hurt no man. As for such as\\nhave neither the grace, nor the good gift, to do well themselves, nor\\nthe common honesty to speak well of others, I must (as I may) hear and\\nbear their baitings with patience.\\n\\n          Yours devoted in his ability,\\n\\n                                  R.

She, on the other side, waxing weary of that her father\\'s purpose,\\nbent her mind to the secret love of the County Palurin: to whom (he\\nbeing likewise inflamed with love of her) by a letter subtly enclosed in\\na cloven cane, she gave to understand a convenient way for their desired\\nmeetings, through an old ruinous vault, whose mouth opened directly\\nunder her chamber floor. Into this vault when she was one day descended\\n(for the conveyance of her lover), her father in the mean season (whose\\nonly joy was in his daughter) came to her chamber, and not finding her\\nthere, supposing her to have been walked abroad for her[15] disport, he\\nthrew him down on her bed, and covered his head with a curtain, minding\\nto abide and rest there till her return. She, nothing suspecting this\\nher father\\'s unseasonable coming, brought up her lover out of the cave\\ninto her chamber, where her father espied their secret love: and he (not\\nespied of them) was upon this sight stricken with marvellous grief; but\\neither for that the sudden despite had amazed him, and taken from him\\nall use of speech, or for that he resolved himself to a more convenient\\nrevenge, he then spake nothing, but noted their return into the vault,\\nand secretly departed. Afterward, bewailing his mishap, he commanded the\\nearl to be attached, imprisoned, strangled, unbowelled, and his heart in\\na cup of gold to be presented to his daughter:[16] she thankfully\\nreceiveth the present, filling the cup (wherein the heart was) with her\\ntears, with a venomous potion (by her distilled for that purpose) she\\ndrank to her earl. Which her father hearing of, came too late to comfort\\nhis dying daughter, who for her last request besought him that her lover\\nand herself might in one tomb be together buried for a perpetual memory\\nof their faithful loves; which request he granted, adding to the burial\\nhimself, slain with his own hands, to his own reproach, and the terror\\nof all other hard-hearted fathers.\\n\\n\\nIntroductio in Actum Secundum.\\n\\nBefore the second act there was heard a sweet noise of still pipes,\\nwhich sounding, Lucrece entered, attended by a maiden of honour with a\\ncovered goddard of gold, and, drawing the curtains, she offereth unto\\nGismunda to taste thereof; which when she had done, the maid returned,\\nand Lucrece raiseth up Gismunda from her bed, and then it followeth _ut_\\nin act ii. sc. 1.\\n\\n\\nIntroductio in Actum Tertium.\\n\\nBefore this act the hautboys sounded a lofty almain, and Cupid ushereth\\nafter him Guiscard and Gismunda, hand in hand; Julio and Lucrece,\\nRenuchio and another maiden of honour.

There is no curious art,\\nNor worldly power: no, not the gods can hold\\nThe sway of flying time, nor him return,\\nWhen he is past: all things unto his might\\nMust bend, and yield unto the iron teeth\\nOf eating time.\" This in the shady night\\nWhen I record: how soon my youth withdraws\\nItself away, how swift my pleasant spring\\nRuns out his race,--this, this, aunt, is the cause,\\nWhen I advise me sadly[53] on this thing,\\nThat makes my heart in pensive dumps dismay\\'d.\\nFor if I should my springing years neglect,\\nAnd suffer youth fruitless to fade away;\\nWhereto live I? or whereto was I born?\\nWherefore hath nature deck\\'d me with her grace?\\nWhy have I tasted these delights of love,\\nAnd felt the sweets of Hymeneus\\' bed?\\nBut to say sooth, dear aunt, it is not I,\\nSole and alone, can thus content to spend\\nMy cheerful years: my father will not still\\nProlong my mournings, which have griev\\'d him,\\nAnd pleased me too long. Then this I crave,\\nTo be resolved of his princely mind.\\nFor, stood it with the pleasure of his will\\nTo marry me, my fortune is not such,\\nSo hard, that I so long should still persist\\nMakeless alone in woful widowhood.\\nAnd shall I tell mine aunt?

Sufficeth this, good niece, that you have said;\\nFor I perceive what sundry passions\\nStrive in your breast, which oftentimes ere this\\nYour countenance confused did bewray.\\nThe ground whereof since I perceive to grow\\nOn just respect of this your sole estate,\\nAnd skilful care of fleeting youth\\'s decay,\\nYour wise foresight such sorrowing to eschew\\nI much commend, and promise as I may\\nTo break this matter, and impart your mind\\nUnto your father, and to work it so,\\nAs both your honour shall not be impeach\\'d,\\nNor he unsatisfied of your desire.\\nBe you no farther grieved, but return\\nInto your chamber.

She lives, my lord, and hath her outward health;\\nBut all the danger of her sickness lies\\nIn the disquiet of her princely mind.\\n\\nTANCRED. Resolve me; what afflicts my daughter so?\\n\\nLUCRECE. Since when the princess hath entomb\\'d her lord,\\nHer late deceased husband of renown;\\nBrother, I see, and very well perceive,\\nShe hath not clos\\'d together in his grave\\nAll sparks of nature, kindness, nor of love:\\nBut as she lives, so living may she feel\\nSuch passions as our tender hearts oppress,\\nSubject unto th\\'impressions of desire:\\nFor well I wot my niece was never wrought\\nOf steel, nor carved from the stony rock:\\nSuch stern hardness we ought not to expect\\nIn her, whose princely heart and springing years\\nYet flow\\'ring in the chiefest heat of youth,\\nIs led of force to feed on such conceits,\\nAs easily befalls that age, which asketh ruth\\nOf them, whom nature bindeth by foresight\\nOf their grave years and careful love to reach\\nThe things that are above their feeble force:\\nAnd for that cause, dread lord, although--\\n\\nTANCRED. Sister, I say,\\nIf you esteem or ought respect my life,\\nHer honour and the welfare of our house,\\nForbear, and wade[55] no farther in this speech.\\nYour words are wounds. I very well perceive\\nThe purpose of this smooth oration:\\nThis I suspected, when you first began\\nThis fair discourse with us. Is this the end\\nOf all our hopes, that we have promised\\nUnto ourself by this her widowhood?\\nWould our dear daughter, would our only joy,\\nWould she forsake us? would she leave us now,\\nBefore she hath clos\\'d up our dying eyes,\\nAnd with her tears bewail\\'d our funeral?\\nNo other solace doth her father crave;\\nBut, whilst the fates maintain his dying life,\\nHer healthful presence gladsome to his soul,\\nWhich rather than he willing would forego,\\nHis heart desires the bitter taste of death.\\nHer late marriage hath taught us to our grief,\\nThat in the fruits of her perpetual sight\\nConsists the only comfort and relief\\nOf our unwieldy age: for what delight,\\nWhat joy, what comfort, have we in this world;\\nNow grown in years, and overworn with cares,\\nSubject unto the sudden stroke of death,\\nAlready falling, like the mellowed fruit,\\nAnd dropping by degrees into our grave?\\nBut what revives us, what maintains our soul\\nWithin the prison of our wither\\'d breast,\\nBut our Gismunda and her cheerful sight?\\nO daughter, daughter! what desert of mine,\\nWherein have I been so unkind to thee,\\nThou shouldst desire to make my naked house\\nYet once again stand desolate by thee?\\nO, let such fancies vanish with their thoughts:\\nTell her I am her father, whose estate,\\nWealth, honour, life, and all that we possess,\\nWholly relies upon her presence here.\\nTell her, I must account her all my joy,\\nWork as she will: but yet she were unjust\\nTo haste his death, that liveth by her sight.\\n\\nLUCRECE. Her gentle heart abhors such ruthless thoughts.\\n\\nTANCRED. Then let her not give place to these desires.\\n\\nLUCRECE. She craves the right that nature challengeth.\\n\\nTANCRED. Tell her, the king commandeth otherwise.\\n\\nLUCRECE. The king\\'s commandment always should be just.\\n\\nTANCRED. Whate\\'er it be, the king\\'s command is just.\\n\\nLUCRECE. Just to command: but justly must he charge.\\n\\nTANCRED. He chargeth justly that commands as king.\\n\\nLUCRECE. The king\\'s command concerns the body best.\\n\\nTANCRED. The king commands obedience of the mind.\\n\\nLUCRECE. That is exempted by the law of kind.\\n\\nTANCRED. That law of kind[56] to children doth belong.\\n\\nLUCRECE. In due obedience to their open wrong?\\n\\nTANCRED. I then, as king and father, will command.\\n\\nLUCRECE. No more than may with right of reason stand.\\n\\nTANCRED. Thou knowest our mind, resolve[57] her, depart--\\nReturn the chase, we have been chas\\'d enough.\\n\\n    [TANCRED _returneth into his palace, and leaveth the hunt_.\\n\\nLUCRECE.

By this I hope my aunt hath mov\\'d the king,\\nAnd knows his mind, and makes return to me\\nTo end at once all this perplexity.\\nLo, where she stands. O, how my trembling heart\\nIn doubtful thoughts panteth within my breast.\\nFor in her message doth rely my smart,\\nOr the sweet quiet of my troubled mind.\\n\\nLUCRECE. Niece, on the point you lately willed me\\nTo treat of with the king on your behalf,\\nI brake even now with him so far, till he\\nIn sudden rage of grief, ere I scarce had\\nMy tale out-told, pray\\'d me to stint my suit,\\nAs that from which his mind abhorred most.\\nAnd well I see his fancy to refute,\\nIs but displeasure gain\\'d and labour lost.\\nSo firmly fixed stands his kingly will\\nThat, till his body shall be laid in grave,\\nHe will not part from the desired sight\\nOf your presence, which silder he should have,\\nIf he had once allied you again\\nIn marriage to any prince or peer--\\nThis is his final resolution.\\n\\nGISMUNDA. A resolution that resolves my blood\\nInto the icy drops of Lethe\\'s flood.\\n\\nLUCRECE. Therefore my counsel is, you shall not stir,\\nNor farther wade in such a case as this:\\nBut since his will is grounded on your love,\\nAnd that it lies in you to save or spill\\nHis old forewasted age, you ought t\\'eschew\\nThe thing that grieves so much his crazed heart,\\nAnd in the state you stand content yourself:\\nAnd let this thought appease your troubled mind,\\nThat in your hands relies your father\\'s death\\nOr blissful life; and since without your sight\\nHe cannot live, nor can his thoughts endure\\nYour hope of marriage, you must then relent,\\nAnd overrule these fond affections;\\nLest it be said you wrought your father\\'s end.\\n\\nGISMUNDA. Dear aunt, I have with patient ears endur\\'d\\nThe hearing of my father\\'s hard behest;\\nAnd since I see that neither I myself,\\nNor your request, can so prevail with him,\\nNor any sage advice persuade his mind\\nTo grant me my desire, in willing wise\\nI must submit me unto his command,\\nAnd frame my heart to serve his majesty.\\nAnd (as I may) to drive away the thoughts\\nThat diversely distract my passions,\\nWhich as I can, I\\'ll labour to subdue,\\nBut sore I fear I shall but toil in vain,\\nWherein, good aunt, I must desire your pain.\\n\\nLUCRECE. What lies in me by comfort or advice,\\nI shall discharge with all humility.\\n\\n    [GISMUNDA _and_ LUCRECE _depart into_ GISMUNDA\\'S _chamber_.\\n\\nCHORUS 1. Who marks our former times and present years,\\nWhat we are now, and looks what we have been,\\nHe cannot but lament with bitter tears\\nThe great decay and change of all women.\\nFor as the world wore on, and waxed old,\\nSo virtue quail\\'d,[58] and vice began to grow.\\nSo that that age, that whilome was of gold,\\nIs worse than brass, more vile than iron now.\\nThe times were such (that if we aught believe\\nOf elder days), women examples were\\nOf rare virtues: Lucrece disdain\\'d to live\\nLonger than chaste; and boldly without fear\\nTook sharp revenge on her enforced heart\\nWith her own hands: for that it not withstood\\nThe wanton will, but yielded to the force\\nOf proud Tarquin, who bought her fame with blood.\\n\\nCHORUS 2. Queen Artemisia thought an heap of stones\\n(Although they were the wonder of that age)\\nA worthless grave, wherein to rest the bones\\nOf her dear lord, but with bold courage\\nShe drank his heart, and made her lovely breast\\nHis tomb, and failed not of wifely faith,\\nOf promis\\'d love and of her bound behest,\\nUntil she ended had her days by death.\\nUlysses\\' wife (such was her steadfastness)\\nAbode his slow return whole twenty years:\\nAnd spent her youthful days in pensiveness,\\nBathing her widow\\'s bed with brinish tears.[59]\\n\\nCHORUS 3.

One parcel of that tower[75]\\nYet stands, which eating time could not devour:\\nA strong turret, compact of stone and rock,\\nHugy without, but horrible within:\\nTo pass to which, by force of handy stroke,\\nA crooked strait is made, that enters in,\\nAnd leads into this ugly loathsome place.\\nWithin the which, carved into the ground,\\nA deep dungeon[76] there runs of narrow space.\\nDreadful and dark, where never light is found:\\nInto this hollow cave, by cruel hest\\nOf King Tancred, were divers servants sent\\nTo work the horror of his furious breast,\\nErst nourish\\'d in his rage, and now stern bent\\nTo have the same perform\\'d. I woful man,\\nAmongst the rest, was one to do the thing.\\nThat to our charge so straitly did belong,\\nIn sort as was commanded by the king.\\nWithin which dreadful prison when we came,\\nThe noble County Palurin, that there\\nLay chain\\'d in gyves,[77] fast fetter\\'d in his bolts,\\nOut of the dark dungeon we did uprear,\\nAnd hal\\'d him thence into a brighter place,\\nThat gave us light to work our tyranny.\\nBut when I once beheld his manly face,\\nAnd saw his cheer, no more appall\\'d with fear\\nOf present death, than he whom never dread\\nDid once amate:[78] my heart abhorred then\\nTo give consent unto so foul a deed:\\nThat wretched death should reave so worthy a man.\\nOn false fortune I cried with loud complaint,\\nThat in such sort o\\'erwhelms nobility.\\nBut he, whom never grief ne fear could taint,\\nWith smiling cheer himself oft willeth me\\nTo leave to plain his case, or sorrow make\\nFor him; for he was far more glad apaid\\nDeath to embrace thus for his lady\\'s sake,\\nThan life or all the joys of life, he said.\\nFor loss of life, quoth he, grieves me no more\\nThan loss of that which I esteemed least:\\nMy lady\\'s grief, lest she should rue therefore,\\nIs all the cause of grief within my breast.\\nHe pray\\'d therefore, that we would make report\\nTo her of those his last words he would say:\\nThat, though he never could in any sort\\nHer gentleness requite, nor never lay\\nWithin his power to serve her as he would;\\nYet she possess\\'d his heart with hand and might,\\nTo do her all the honour that he could.\\nThis was to him, of all the joys that might\\nRevive his heart, the chiefest joy of all,\\nThat to declare the faithful heart which he\\nDid bear to her, fortune so well did fall,\\nThat in her love he should both live and die.\\nAfter these words he stay\\'d, and spake no more,\\nBut joyfully beholding us each one,\\nHis words and cheer amazed us so sore,\\nThat still we stood; when forthwith thereupon:\\nBut, why slack you, quoth he, to do the thing\\nFor which you come? make speed, and stay no more:\\nPerform your master\\'s will. Now tell the king\\nHe hath his life, for which he long\\'d so sore:\\nAnd with those words himself with his own hand\\nFast\\'ned the bands about his neck. The rest\\nWond\\'ring at his stout heart, astonied[79] stand\\nTo see him offer thus himself to death.\\nWhat stony breast, or what hard heart of flint\\nWould not relent to see this dreary sight?\\nSo goodly a man, whom death nor fortune\\'s dint\\nCould once disarm, murder\\'d with such despite;\\nAnd in such sort bereft, amidst the flowers\\nOf his fresh years, that ruthful was to seen:\\n\"For violent is death, when he devours\\nYoung men or virgins, while their years be green.\"\\nLo! now our servants seeing him take the bands,\\nAnd on his neck himself to make them fast;\\nWithout delay set to their cruel hands,\\nAnd sought to work their fierce intent with haste.\\nThey stretch the bloody bands; and when the breath\\nBegan to fail his breast, they slack\\'d again:\\nThrice did they pull, and thrice they loosed him,\\nSo did their hands repine against their hearts:\\nAnd ofttimes loosed to his greater pain.\\n\"But date of death, that fixed is so fast,\\nBeyond his course there may no wight extend;\"\\nFor strangled is this noble Earl at last,\\nBereft of life, unworthy such an end.\\n\\nCHORUS.

Could any heavier woe\\nBe wrought to him, than to destroy him so?\\n\\nRENUCHIO. What, think you this outrage did end so well?\\nThe horror of the fact, the greatest grief,\\nThe massacre, the terror is to tell.\\n\\nCHORUS. Alack! what could be more? they threw percase\\nThe dead body to be devour\\'d and torn\\nOf the wild beasts.\\n\\nRENUCHIO.

What kind of cruelty is this you name?\\nDeclare forthwith, and whereunto doth tend\\nThis farther plaint.\\n\\nRENUCHIO.            After his breath was gone,\\nForced perforce thus from his panting breast,\\nStraight they despoiled him; and not alone\\nContented with his death, on the dead corpse,\\nWhich ravenous beasts forbear to lacerate,\\nEven upon this our villains fresh begun\\nTo show new cruelty; forthwith they pierce\\nHis naked belly, and unripp\\'d it so,\\nThat out the bowels gush\\'d. Who can rehearse\\nTheir tyranny, wherewith my heart yet bleeds?\\nThe warm entrails were torn out of his breast,\\nWithin their hands trembling, not fully dead;\\nHis veins smok\\'d, his bowels all-to reeked,\\nRuthless were rent, and thrown about the place:\\nAll clottered lay the blood in lumps of gore,\\nSprent[80] on his corpse, and on his paled face;\\nHis trembling heart, yet leaping, out they tore,\\nAnd cruelly upon a rapier\\nThey fix\\'d the same, and in this hateful wise\\nUnto the king this heart they do present:\\nA sight long\\'d for to feed his ireful eyes.\\nThe king perceiving each thing to be wrought\\nAs he had will\\'d, rejoicing to behold\\nUpon the bloody sword the pierced heart,\\nHe calls then for this massy cup of gold,\\nInto the which the woful heart he cast;\\nAnd reaching me the same: now go, quoth he,\\nUnto my daughter, and with speedy haste\\nPresent her this, and say to her from me,\\nThy father hath here in this cup thee sent\\nThat thing to joy and comfort thee withal,\\nWhich thou lovedst best, even as thou wert content\\nTo comfort him with his chief joy of all.\\n\\nCHORUS. O hateful fact! O passing cruelty!\\nO murder wrought with too much hard despite!\\nO heinous deed, which no posterity\\nWill once believe!\\n\\nRENUCHIO.          Thus was Earl Palurin\\nStrangled unto the death, yea, after death\\nHis heart and blood disbowell\\'d from his breast.\\nBut what availeth plaint? It is but breath\\nForewasted all in vain. Why do I rest\\nHere in this place? Why go I not, and do\\nThe hateful message to my charge committed?\\nO, were it not that I am forced thereto\\nBy a king\\'s will, here would I stay my feet,\\nNe one whit farther wade in this intent!\\nBut I must yield me to my prince\\'s hest;\\nYet doth this somewhat comfort mine unrest,\\nI am resolv\\'d her grief not to behold,\\nBut get me gone, my message being told.\\nWhere is the princess\\' chamber?\\n\\nCHORUS.

COLLIER\\'S PREFACE.[89]\\n\\n\\nThomas Lodge, in his \"Alarum against Usurers,\" 1584, speaks of his\\n\"birth,\" and of \"the offspring from whence he came,\" as if he were at\\nleast respectably descended; and on the authority of Anthony Wood, it\\nhas been asserted by all subsequent biographers that he was of a\\nLincolnshire family. [The fact is, that Lodge was the second son of Sir\\nThomas Lodge, Lord Mayor of London, who died in 1584, by his wife, the\\ndaughter of Sir William Laxton.] Thomas Salter, about the year 1580,\\ndedicated his \"Mirror of Modesty\" to [the poet\\'s mother, Lady Anne\\nLodge].\\n\\nLangbaine seems to be under a mistake when he states that Lodge was of\\nCambridge. Wood claims him for the University of Oxford,[90] where he\\ntraces him as early as 1573, when he must have been about seventeen\\nyears old, if he were born, as is generally supposed, in 1556. We are\\ntold by himself that he was a Servitor of Trinity College, and that he\\nwas educated under Sir Edward Hoby. At what time and for what cause\\nLodge left Oxford is not known; but Stephen Gosson, in the dedication of\\nhis \"Plays Confuted in Five Actions,\" printed about 1582,[91] accuses\\nhim of having become \"a vagrant person, visited by the heavy hand of\\nGod,\" as if he had taken to the stage, and thereby had incurred the\\nvengeance of heaven. In 1584, when Lodge answered Gosson, he was a\\nstudent of Lincoln\\'s Inn;[92] and to \"his courteous friends, the\\nGentlemen of the Inns of Court,\" he dedicated his \"Alarum against\\nUsurers.\" He afterwards, as he informs Lord Hunsdon, in the epistle\\nbefore his \"Rosalynde,\" 1590, \"fell from books to arms;\" and he calls it\\n\"the work of a soldier and a scholar,\" adding that he had sailed with\\nCaptain Clarke to the islands of Terceras and the Canaries. In 1596, he\\npublished his \"Margarite of America,\" and he mentions that it was\\nwritten in the Straits of Magellan, on a voyage with Cavendish. To this\\nspecies of vagrancy, however, Gosson did not refer.\\n\\nThat Lodge was vagrant in his pursuits we have sufficient evidence; for,\\nafter having perhaps been upon the stage, having entered himself at\\nLincoln\\'s Inn, having become a soldier, and having sailed with Clarke\\nand Cavendish, he went, according to Wood, to study medicine at\\nAvignon.[93] This change, if it took place at all, which may admit of\\ndoubt,[94] did not occur until after 1596. In 1595 his \"Fig for Momus\"\\nappeared. Besides Satires, it contains Epistles and Eclogues; and in one\\nof the latter Lodge speaks in his own person, under the character of\\n\"Golde\" (the same letters that compose his name), and there states his\\ndetermination no longer to pursue ill-rewarded poetry--\\n\\n    \"Which sound rewards, since this neglected time,\\n    Repines to yield to men of high desert,\\n    I\\'ll cease to ravel out my wits in rhyme,\\n    For such who make so base account of art;\\n    And since by wit there is no means to climb,\\n    I\\'ll hold the plough awhile, and ply the cart;\\n    And if my muse to wonted course return,\\n    I\\'ll write and judge, peruse, commend and burn.\"\\n\\nThe dedication of his \"Wit\\'s Misery, and the World\\'s Madness,\" is dated\\n\"from my house, at Low Layton, 5th November 1596.\"\\n\\nThe principal reasons for supposing that Lodge studied medicine are the\\nexistence of a \"Treatise of the Plague,\" published by \"Thomas Lodge,\\nDoctor in Physic,\" in 1603, and of a collection of medical recipes in\\nMS., called \"The Poor Man\\'s Legacy,\" addressed to the Countess of\\nArundel, and sold among the books of the Duke of Norfolk.[95] [There can\\nbe little or no question that the physician and poet were one and the\\nsame. In \"England\\'s Parnassus,\" 1600, he is called indifferently Thomas\\nLodge and Doctor Lodge.] The author of the \"Treatise of the Plague\"\\nexpressly tells the Lord Mayor of London, in the dedication, that he was\\n\"bred and brought up\" in the city. Thomas Heywood, in his \"Troja\\nBritannica,\" 1609, enumerates the celebrated physicians then living--\\n\\n    \"As famous Butler, Pedy, Turner, Poe,\\n    Atkinson, Lyster, _Lodge_, who still survive.\"--C. 3.\\n\\nIt hardly deserves remark that Lodge is placed last in this list; but\\nhad he been the same individual who had written for the stage, was the\\nfriend of so many dramatists, and was so well known as a lyric poet, it\\nseems likely that Heywood would have said more about him.[96] It is a\\nsingular coincidence, that having written how to prevent and cure the\\nplague, he should die of that disease during the great mortality of\\n1625. Wood\\'s expressions on this point, however, are not decisive: \"He\\nmade his last _exit_ (of the plague, I think) in September 1625, leaving\\nthen behind him a widow called Joan.\" It has been conjectured [rather\\nfoolishly] that he was a Roman Catholic, from a statement made by one of\\nhis biographers that, while he practised medicine in London, he was much\\npatronised by persons of that persuasion.\\n\\nThere are but two existing dramatic productions on the title-pages of\\nwhich the name of Lodge is found:[97] the one he wrote alone, and the\\nother in partnership with Robert Greene:--\\n\\n(1.) The Wounds of Civill War. Lively set forth in the true Tragedies of\\nMarius and Scilla, &c. Written by Thomas Lodge, Gent. 1594, 4to.\\n\\n(2.) A Looking Glasse for London and Englande. Made by Thomas Lodge,\\nGentleman, and Robert Greene, _in Artibus Magister_. 1594, 1598, 1602,\\n1617, all in 4to.[98]\\n\\nThe most remarkable [of his works], and that which has been most often\\nreprinted, is his \"Rosalynde\" which, as is well known, Shakespeare\\nclosely followed in \"As You Like It.\"[99]\\n\\nAnterior to the date of any of his other pieces must have been Lodge\\'s\\ndefence of stage-plays, because Stephen Gosson replied to it about 1582.\\nIt was long thought, on the authority of Prynne, that Lodge\\'s tract was\\ncalled \"The Play of Plays,\" but Mr Malone ascertained that to be a\\ndifferent production. The only copy of Lodge\\'s pamphlet seen by Mr\\nMalone was without a title, and it was probably the same that was sold\\namong the books of Topham Beauclerc in 1781. It is spoken of in \"The\\nFrench Academy\" [1589] as having \"lately passed the press;\" but Lodge\\nhimself, in his \"Alarum against Usurers,\" very clearly accounts for its\\nextreme rarity: he says, \"by reason of the slenderness of the subject\\n(because it was in defence of plaies and play-makers) the godly and\\nreverent that had to deal in the cause, misliking it, forbad the\\npublishing;\" and he charges Gosson with \"comming by a private unperfect\\ncoppye,\" on which he framed his answer, entitled, \"Plays confuted in\\nFive Actions.\"\\n\\nMr Malone (\"Shakespeare,\" by Boswell, ii. 250) contends that Spenser\\nalludes to Lodge, in his \"Tears of the Muses,\" under the name of Alcon,\\nin the following lines:--\\n\\n    \"And there is pleasing Alcon, could he raise\\n    His tunes from lays to matters of more skill;\"\\n\\nand he adds that Spenser calls Lodge Alcon, from one of the characters\\nin \"A Looking Glasse for London and Englande;\" but this argument would\\napply just as much to Lodge\\'s coadjutor Greene. Mr Malone further argues\\nthat Lodge, roused by this applause (which he repaid in his \"Phillis\"),\\nproduced not long afterwards a \"matter of more skill,\" in \"The Wounds of\\nCivil War.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MOST LAMENTABLE AND TRUE\\n\\n    TRAGEDIES OF\\n\\nMARIUS AND SYLLA.[100]\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Enter on the Capitol_ SULPITIUS, _Tribune_, CAIUS MARIUS,\\n    Q.

Believe me, noble Romans and grave senators,\\nThis strange election, and this new-made law\\nWill witness our unstable government,\\nAnd dispossess Rome of her empery:\\nFor although Marius be renown\\'d in arms,\\nFamous for prowess, and grave in warlike drifts,\\nYet may the sunshine of his former deeds\\nNothing eclipse our Sylla\\'s dignity.\\nBy lot and by election he was made\\nChief general against Mithridates,\\nAnd shall we then abridge him of that rule?\\n\\'Twere injury to Sylla and to Rome:\\nNor would the height of his all-daring mind\\nBrook to the death so vile and foul disgrace.\\n\\nJ.

Marius, I smile at these thy foolish words;\\nAnd credit me, should laugh outright, I fear,\\nIf that I knew not how thy froward age\\nDoth make thy sense as feeble as thy joints.\\n\\nMARIUS.

Avaunt, thou traitor, proud and insolent!\\nHow dar\\'st thou press near civil government.\\n\\nMARIUS. Why, Master Consul, are you grown so hot?\\nI\\'ll have a present cooling card for you.\\nBe therefore well advis\\'d, and move me not:\\nFor though by you I was exil\\'d from Rome,\\nAnd in the desert from a prince\\'s seat\\nLeft to bewail ingratitudes of Rome;\\nThough I have known your thirsty throats have long\\'d\\nTo bathe themselves in my distilling blood,\\nYet Marius, sirs, hath pity join\\'d with power.\\nLo, here the imperial ensign which I wield,\\nThat waveth mercy to my wishers-well:\\nAnd more: see here the dangerous trote of war,\\nThat at the point is steel\\'d with ghastly death.\\n\\nOCTAVIUS. Thou exile, threaten\\'st thou a consul then?\\nLictors, go draw him hence! such braving mates\\nAre not to boast their arms in quiet states.\\n\\nMARIUS. Go draw me hence! What! no relent, Octavius?\\n\\nYOUNG MARIUS. My lord, what heart indurate with revenge\\nCould leave this lozel[136], threat\\'ning murder thus?\\nVouchsafe me leave to taint that traitor seat\\nWith flowing streams of his contagious blood.\\n\\nOCTAVIUS. The father\\'s son, I know him by his talk,\\nThat scolds in words, when fingers cannot walk.\\nBut Jove, I hope, will one day send to Rome\\nThe blessed patron of this monarchy,\\nWho will revenge injustice by his sword.\\n\\nCINNA. Such braving hopes, such cursed arguments:\\nSo strict command, such arrogant controls!\\nSuffer me, Marius, that am consul now,\\nTo do thee justice, and confound the wretch.\\n\\nMARIUS. Cinna, you know I am a private man,\\nThat still submit my censures to your will.\\n\\nCINNA. Then, soldiers, draw this traitor from the throne,\\nAnd let him die, for Cinna wills it so.\\n\\nYOUNG MARIUS. Ay, now, my Cinna, noble consul, speaks.\\nOctavius, your checks shall cost you dear.\\n\\nOCTAVIUS. And let me die, for Cinna wills it so!\\nIs then the reverence of this robe contemn\\'d?\\nAre these associates of so small regard?\\nWhy then, Octavius willingly consents\\nTo entertain the sentence of his death.\\nBut let the proudest traitor work his will;\\nI fear no strokes, but here will sit me still.\\nSince justice sleeps, since tyrants reign in Rome,\\nOctavius longs for death to die in Rome.\\n\\nCINNA. Then strike him where he sits; then hale him hence.\\n\\nOCTAVIUS. Heavens punish Cinna\\'s pride and thy offence.\\n\\n            [_A Soldier stabs him; he is carried away_.\\n\\nCINNA. Now is he fallen that threaten\\'d Marius;\\nNow will I sit and plead for Marius.\\n\\nMARIUS. Thou dost me justice, Cinna, for you see\\nThese peers of Rome of[137] late exiled me.\\n\\nLEPIDUS. Your lordship doth injustice to accuse\\nThose, who in your behalf did not offend.\\n\\nFLACCUS. We grieve to see the aged Marius\\nStand like a private man in view of Rome.\\n\\nCINNA. Then bid him sit; and lo, an empty place:\\nRevoke his exile from his government,\\nAnd so prevent your farther detriment.\\n\\nLEPIDUS. We will account both Marius and his friends,\\nHis son and all his followers, free in Rome:\\nAnd since we see the dangerous times at hand,\\nAnd hear of Sylla\\'s confidence and haste,\\nAnd know his hate and rancour to these lords,\\nWe[138] him create for consul, to prevent\\nThe policies of Sylla and his friends.\\n\\nCINNA. Then, both confirm\\'d by state and full consent,\\nThe rods and axe to Marius I present,\\nAnd here invest thee with the consul\\'s pall.\\n\\nFLACCUS. Long, fortunate, and happy life betide\\nOld Marius in his sevenfold consulship.\\n\\nYOUNG MARIUS. And so let Marius live and govern Rome,\\nAs cursed Sylla never look on Rome.\\n\\nMARIUS. Then plac\\'d in consul\\'s throne, you Roman states,\\n                             [_He takes his seat_.\\nRecall\\'d from banishment by your decrees,\\nInstall\\'d in this imperial seat to rule,\\nOld Marius thanks his friends and favourites,\\nFrom whom this final favour he requires:\\nThat, seeing Sylla by his murderous blade\\nBrought fierce seditions first to head in Rome,\\nAnd forced laws to banish innocents,\\nI crave by course of reason and desert,\\nThat he may be proclaimed, as erst was I,\\nA traitor and an enemy of Rome.\\nLet all his friends be banish\\'d out of town;\\nThen, cutting off the branch where troubles spring,\\nRome shall have peace and plenty in her walls.\\n\\nCINNA. In equity it needs must be, my friends,\\nThat one be guilty of our common harms:\\nAnd since that Marius is accounted free,\\nSylla with all his friends must traitors be.\\n\\nYOUNG MARIUS. My father\\'s reasons, Romans, are of force;\\nFor if you see, and live not to secure,\\nYou know that, in so great a state as this,\\nTwo mighty foes can never well agree.\\n\\nLEPIDUS. Then let us seek to please our consul first,\\nAnd then prepare to keep the exile out.\\nCinna, as Marius and these lords agree,\\nFirm this edict, and let it pass for me.\\n\\nCINNA. Then, Romans, in the name of all this state,\\nI here proclaim and publish this decree;\\nThat Sylla with his friends, allies, and all,\\nAre banish\\'d exiles, traitors unto Rome:\\nAnd to extinguish both his name and state,\\nWe will his house be razed to the ground,\\nHis goods confiscate: this our censure is.\\nLictor, proclaim this in the market-place,\\nAnd see it executed out of hand.\\n                                    [_Exit Lictor_.\\n\\nMARIUS.

I go, my lord, in hope to make the world\\nReport my service and my duty too;\\nAnd that proud challenger of Asia\\nShall find that Marius\\' son hath force and wit.\\n                              [_Exit cum_ CETHEGO.\\n\\nMARIUS.

Dread consul, we have found Cornelia here\\nAnd Sylla\\'s daughter posting out of town.\\n\\nMARIUS. Ladies of worth, both beautiful and wise,\\nBut near allied unto my greatest foe:\\nYet Marius\\' mind, that never meant disgrace,\\nMore likes their courage than their comely face.\\nAre you Cornelia, madam, Sylla\\'s wife?\\n\\nCORNELIA. I am Cornelia, Sylla\\'s wife; what then?\\n\\nMARIUS. And is this Fulvia, Sylla\\'s daughter, too?\\n\\nFULVIA. And this is Fulvia, Sylla\\'s daughter, too.\\n\\nMARIUS. Two welcome guests, in whom the majesty\\nOf my conceit and courage must consist.\\nWhat think you, senators and countrymen?\\nSee, here are two, the fairest stars of Rome.\\nThe dearest dainties of my warlike foe,\\nWhose lives upon your censures do subsist.[139]\\n\\nLEPIDUS. Dread consul, the continuance of their lives\\nShall egg on Sylla to a greater haste;\\nAnd, in bereaving of their vital breath,\\nYour grace shall force more fury from your foe.\\nOf these extremes we leave the choice to you.\\n\\nMARIUS. Then think that some strange fortune shall ensue.\\n\\nFULVIA. Poor Fulvia, now thy happy days are done!\\nInstead of marriage pomp, the fatal lights\\nOf funerals must masque about thy bed:\\nNor shall thy father\\'s arms with kind embrace\\nHem in thy shoulders, trembling now for fear.\\nI see in Marius\\' looks such tragedies,\\nAs fear my heart; and fountains fill mine eyes.\\n\\nCORNELIA.

By\\'r lady,[140] Fulvia, you are gaily read:\\nYour mother well may boast you for her own;\\nFor both of you have words and scoffs at will.\\nAnd since I like the compass of your wit,\\nMyself will stand, and, ladies, you shall sit.\\nAnd, if you please to wade in farther words,\\nLet\\'s see what brawls your memories affords.\\n\\nCORNELIA. Your lordship\\'s passing mannerly in jest;\\nBut that you may perceive we smell your drift,\\nWe both will sit, and countenance your shift.\\n\\nMARIUS.

As ready as at first for to displease;\\nFor, full confirm\\'d that we shall surely die,\\nWe wait our ends with Roman constancy.\\n\\nMARIUS.

Now, my lord.\\nHave you brought those things?\\n\\n    _Enter_ LECTORIUS.\\n\\nLECTORIUS. I have, noble consul.\\n\\nMARIUS. Now, ladies, you are resolute to die?\\n\\nCORNELIA. Ay, Marius, for terror cannot daunt us.\\nTortures were framed to dread the baser eye,\\nAnd not t\\'appal a princely majesty.\\n\\nMARIUS.

Doth Marius use with glorious words to jest,\\nAnd mock his captives with these glosing[142] terms?\\n\\nMARIUS. No, ladies;\\nMarius hath sought for honour with his sword,\\nAnd holds disdain to triumph in your falls.\\nLive, Cornelia: live, fair and fairest Fulvia!\\nIf you have done or wrought me injury,\\nSylla shall pay it through his misery.\\n\\nFULVIA.

The city, noble Sylla, razed is,\\nAnd Marius dead--not by our swords, my lord,\\nBut with more constancy than Cato died.\\n\\nSYLLA. What, constancy! and but a very boy?\\nWhy then I see he was his father\\'s son.\\nBut let us have this constancy described.\\n\\nLUCRETIUS.

What, did the brainsick boy upbraid me so?\\nBut let us hear the rest, Lucretius.\\n\\nLUCRETIUS. And, after great persuasions to his friends\\nAnd worthy resolution of them all,\\nHe first did sheathe his poniard in his breast,\\nAnd so in order died all the rest.\\n\\nSYLLA.

Whilst graver thoughts of honour should allure thee,\\nWhat maketh Sylla muse and mutter thus?\\n\\nSYLLA. I, that have pass\\'d amidst the mighty troops\\nOf armed legions, through a world of war,\\nDo now bethink me, Flaccus, of my chance:\\nHow I alone, where many men were slain,\\nIn spite of fate am come to Rome again.\\nAnd though[161] I wield the reverend stiles of state;\\nShe[162], Sylla, with a beck could break thy neck.\\nWhat lord of Rome hath dar\\'d as much as I?\\nYet, Flaccus, know\\'st thou not that I must die?\\nThe labouring sisters on the weary looms\\nHave drawn my web of life at length, I know;\\nAnd men of wit must think upon their tombs:\\nFor beasts with careless steps to Lethe go\\nWhere men, whose thoughts and honours climb on high,\\nLiving with fame, must learn with fame to die.\\n\\nPOMPEY. What lets, my lord, in governing this state,\\nTo live in rest, and die with honour too?\\n\\nSYLLA. What lets me, Pompey? why, my courteous friend,\\nCan he remain secure that wields a charge,\\nOr think of wit when flatterers do commend,\\nOr be advis\\'d that careless runs at large?\\nNo, Pompey: honey words make foolish minds,\\nAnd pow\\'r the greatest wit with error blinds.\\nFlaccus, I murder\\'d Anthony, thy friend;\\nRomans, some here have lost at my command\\nTheir fathers, mothers, brothers, and allies;\\nAnd think you, Sylla, thinking these misdeeds,\\nBethinks not on your grudges and mislike?\\nYes, countrymen, I bear them still in mind:\\nThen, Pompey, were I not a silly man\\nTo leave my rule, and trust these Romans then?\\n\\nPOMPEY. Your grace hath small occasions of mistrust,\\nNor seek these citizens for your disclaim.\\n\\nSYLLA. But, Pompey, now these reaching plumes of pride,\\nThat mounted up my fortunes to the clouds,\\nBy grave conceits shall straight be laid aside,\\nAnd Sylla thinks of far more simple shrouds.\\nFor having tried occasion in the throne,\\nI\\'ll see if she dare frown, when state is gone.\\nLo, senators, the man that sat aloft,\\nNow deigns to give inferiors highest place.\\nLo, here the man whom Rome repined oft,\\nA private man content to brook disgrace.\\nRomans, lo, here the axes, rods, and all:\\nI\\'ll master fortune, lest she make me thrall.\\nNow whoso list accuse me, tell my wrongs,\\nUpbraid me in the presence of this state.\\nIs none these jolly citizens among,\\nThat will accuse, or say I am ingrate?\\nThen will I say, and boldly boast my chances,\\nThat nought may force the man whom fate advances.\\n\\nFLACCUS. What meaneth Sylla in this sullen mood,\\nTo leave his titles on the sudden thus?\\n\\nSYLLA. Consul, I mean with calm and quiet mind\\nTo pass my days, till[163] happy death I find.\\n\\nPOMPEY.

No, sirrah, he must come to me.\\n\\nCLOWN. Hark you, master; how, if he be not at home?\\nWhat shall I do then?\\n\\nSEGASTO. Why then, leave word with some of his folks.\\n\\nCLOWN. How,[173] master, if there be nobody within?\\nI will leave word with his dog.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Why, can his dog speak?\\n\\nCLOWN. I cannot tell; wherefore doth he keep his chamber else?\\n\\nSEGASTO.

You must come to my master, Captain Treble-knave.\\n\\nTREMELIO. My Lord Segasto, did you send for me?\\n\\nSEGASTO. I did, Tremelio. Sirrah, about your business.\\n\\nCLOWN. Ay, marry, what\\'s that, can you tell?\\n\\nSEGASTO. No, not well.\\n\\nCLOWN. Marry, then, I can; straight to the kitchen-dresser, to John\\nthe cook, and get me a good piece of beef and brewis; and then to the\\nbuttery-hatch, to Thomas the butler for a jack of beer, and there for\\nan hour I\\'ll so belabour myself; and therefore I pray you call me not\\ntill you think I have done, I pray you, good master.\\n\\nSEGASTO.

But do you hear, Master King, he is\\nkin to a monkey; his neck is bigger than his head.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Sirrah, away with him, and hang him about the middle.\\n\\nCLOWN. Yes, forsooth, I warrant you.

Preserved the life of my sometime distressed daughter?\\nHow can that be? I never knew the time,\\nWherein thou wast distress\\'d. I never knew the day\\nBut that I have maintained thy estate,\\nAs best beseem\\'d the daughter of a king:\\nI never saw the shepherd until now.\\nHow comes it then, that he preserv\\'d thy life?\\n\\nAMADINE. Once walking with Segasto in the woods,\\nFurther than our accustom\\'d manner was,\\nRight before us down a steep-fall hill,\\nA monstrous ugly bear did hie him fast\\nTo meet us both--now whether this be true,\\nI refer it to the credit of Segasto.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Most true, an\\'t like your majesty.\\n\\nKING. How then?\\n\\nAMADINE. The bear, being eager to obtain his prey,\\nMade forward to us with an open mouth,\\nAs if he meant to swallow us both at once.\\nThe sight whereof did make us both to dread,\\nBut specially your daughter Amadine,\\nWho for I saw no succour incident,\\nBut in Segasto\\'s valour, I grew desperate,\\nAnd he most coward-like began to fly.\\nLeft me distress\\'d to be devour\\'d of him--\\nHow say you, Segasto? is it not true?\\n\\nKING. His silence verifies it to be true. What then?\\n\\nAMADINE. Then I amaz\\'d, distressed, all alone,\\nDid hie me fast to \\'scape that ugly bear.\\nBut all in vain; for why he reached after me,\\nAnd oft I hardly did[174] escape his paws,\\nTill at the length this shepherd came,\\nAnd brought to me his head.\\nCome hither, boy; lo, here it is,\\nWhich I present unto your majesty.\\n\\nKING. The slaughter of this bear deserves great fame.\\n\\nSEGASTO. The slaughter of a man deserves great blame.\\n\\nKING. Indeed occasion oftentimes so falls out.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Tremelio in the wars, O King, preserved thee.\\n\\nAMADINE. The shepherd in the woods, O King, preserved me.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Tremelio fought, when many men did yield.\\n\\nAMADINE. So would the shepherd, had he been in field.\\n\\nCLOWN. So would my master, had he not run away.    [_Aside_.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Tremelio\\'s force saved thousands from the foe.\\n\\nAMADINE.

Shepherd, it is only Segasto that\\nProcures thy banishment.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Unworthy wights are most in jealousy.\\n\\nAMADINE. Would God they would\\nFree thee from banishment, or likewise banish me.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Amen say I, to have your company.\\n\\nAMADINE. Well, shepherd, sith thou sufferest\\nThis for my sake,\\nWith thee in exile also let me live,\\nOn this condition, shepherd, thou canst love.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. No longer love, no longer let me live.\\n\\nAMADINE. Of late I loved one indeed, now love\\nI none but only thee.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS.

A stray king\\'s daughter run away with a shepherd.\\nWherefore? canst thou tell?\\n\\nCLOWN. Yes, that I can; \\'tis this. My master and Amadine walking one\\nday abroad, nearer to these woods than they were used (about what I\\ncannot tell); but toward them comes running a great bear. Now my master\\nhe played the man, and ran away; and Amadine, crying after him;--now,\\nsir, comes me a shepherd, and he strikes off the bear\\'s head. Now,\\nwhether the bear were dead before or no, I cannot tell; for bring\\ntwenty bears before me, and bind their hands and feet, and I\\'ll kill\\nthem all. Now, ever since, Amadine hath been in love with the shepherd;\\nand for goodwill she\\'s even run away with the shepherd.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. What manner of man was a? canst describe him unto me?\\n\\nCLOWN. Scribe him? ay, I warrant you, that I can. A was a little, low,\\nbroad, tall, narrow, big, well-favoured fellow: a jerkin of white cloth,\\nand buttons of the same cloth.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Thou describest him well; but if I chance to see any such,\\npray you, where shall I find you, or what\\'s your name?\\n\\nCLOWN. My name is called Master Mouse.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. O Master Mouse, I pray you, what office might you bear\\nin the court?\\n\\nCLOWN. Marry, sir, I am a rusher of the stable.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. O, usher of the table.\\n\\nCLOWN. Nay, I say rusher, and I\\'ll prove my office good. For look, sir,\\nwhen any comes from under the sea or so, and a dog chance to blow his\\nnose backward, then with a whip I give him the good time of the day,\\nand straw rushes presently. Therefore I am a rusher: a high office,\\nI promise ye.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. But where shall I find you in the court?\\n\\nCLOWN. Why, where it is best being, either in the kitchen a eating, or\\nin the buttery drinking. But if you come, I will provide for thee a\\npiece of beef and brewis knuckle-deep in fat.

Thou hold\\'st it well.    [To _Amadine_.]\\nLook how he doth;\\nThou mayest the sooner learn.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS.

Then now or never is my time to strike.\\n\\nBREMO. And when thou strikest, be sure to hit the head.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. The head?\\n\\nBREMO. The very head.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Then have at thine,\\nSo lie there and die;    [_He strikes him down dead_.\\nA death, no doubt, according to desert,\\nOr else a worse, as thou deservest a worse.\\n\\nAMADINE.

Then seek another, that may you better please.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Well, Amadine. it only rests in thee\\nWithout delay to make thy choice of three.\\nThere stands Segasto: here a shepherd stands:\\nThere stands the third. Now make thy choice.\\n\\nCLOWN. A lord at the least I am.\\n\\nAMADINE. My choice is made; for I will none but thee.\\n\\nSEGASTO. A worthy mate, no doubt, for such a wife.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. And, Amadine, why wilt thou none but me?\\nI cannot keep thee, as thy father did;\\nI have no lands for to maintain thy state;\\nMoreover, if thou mean to be my wife,\\nCommonly this must be thy use:\\nTo bed at midnight, up at four,\\nDrudge all day, and trudge from place to place,\\nWhereby our daily victuals for to win:\\nAnd last of all, which is the worst of all,\\nNo princess then, but a plain shepherd\\'s wife.\\n\\nCLOWN. Then God gi\\' you good morrow, goody shepherd!    [_Aside_.\\n\\nAMADINE. It shall not need; if Amadine do live,\\nThou shalt be crowned King of Arragon.\\n\\nCLOWN. O master, laugh; when he\\'s king, then I\\'ll be a queen.  [_Aside_.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Then know that, which never tofore was known,\\nI am no shepherd, no Arragonian I,\\nBut born of royal blood. My father\\'s of Valentia\\nKing, my mother Queen: who, for thy secret[193] sake,\\nTook this hard task in hand.\\n\\nAMADINE. Ah, how I joy my fortune is so good!\\n\\nSEGASTO. Well, now I see Segasto shall not speed;\\nBut, Mucedorus, I as much do joy\\nTo see thee here within our Court of Arragon,\\nAs if a kingdom had befallen me this time.\\nI with my heart surrender her to thee.\\n                            [_He giveth her unto him_.\\nAnd loose[194] what right to Amadine I have.\\n\\nCLOWN.

Master, bear this and bear all.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Why so, sir?\\n\\nCLOWN. He sees you take a goose by the crown.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Go to, sir, away, post you to the King,\\nWhose heart is fraught with careful doubts;\\nGlad him up, and tell him these good news,\\nAnd we will follow as fast as we may.\\n\\nCLOWN.

A King, a king, a king!\\n\\nCOLLEN. Why, how now, sirrah? what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nCLOWN. O, \\'tis news for a king; \\'tis worth money.\\n\\nKING. Why, sirrah, thou shalt have silver and gold, if it be good.\\n\\nCLOWN. O, \\'tis good, \\'tis good. Amadine--\\n\\nKING. O, what of her? tell me, and I will make thee a knight.\\n\\nCLOWN. How, a sprite? no, by Lady, I will not be a sprite, masters.\\nGet ye away; if I be a sprite, I shall be so lean, I shall make you\\nall afraid.\\n\\nCOLLEN. Thou sot, the King means to make thee a gentleman.\\n\\nCLOWN. Why, I shall want \\'pparel.\\n\\nKING. Thou shalt want for nothing.\\n\\nCLOWN. Then stand away; trick[196] up thyself; here they come.\\n\\n    _Enter_ SEGASTO, MUCEDORUS, _and_ AMADINE.\\n\\nAMADINE. My gracious father, pardon thy disloyal daughter.\\n\\nKING. What, do mine eyes behold my daughter\\nAmadin? Rise up, dear daughter,\\nAnd let these my embracing arms show some\\nToken of thy father\\'s joy, which, ever since\\nThy departure, hath languished in sorrow.\\n\\nAMADINE. Dear father,\\nNever were your sorrows greater than my griefs:\\nNever you so desolate as I comfortless.\\nYet, nevertheless, acknowledging myself\\nTo be the cause of both, on bended knees\\nI humbly crave your pardon.\\n\\nKING. I\\'ll pardon thee, dear daughter, but as for\\nHim----\\n\\nAMADINE. Ah, father! what of him?\\n\\nKING. As sure as I am king, and wear the crown,\\nI will revenge on that accursed wretch.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Yet, worthy prince, work not thy will in wrath:\\nShow favour.\\n\\nKING. Ay, such favour as thou deservest.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. I do deserve the daughter of a king.\\n\\nKING. O, impudent! a shepherd and so insolent?\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. No shepherd [am] I, but a worthy prince.\\n\\nKING. In fair conceit, not princely born.\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. Yes, princely born; my father is a king,\\nMy mother queen, and of Valentia both.\\n\\nKING. What, Mucedorus? welcome to our court!\\nWhat cause hadst thou to come to me disguis\\'d?\\n\\nMUCEDORUS. No cause to fear; I caused no offence,\\nBut this--desiring thy daughter\\'s virtues for to see,\\nDisguis\\'d myself from out my father\\'s court,\\nUnknown to any. In secret I did rest,\\nAnd passed many troubles near to death;\\nSo hath your daughter my partaker been,\\nAs you shall know hereafter more at large,\\nDesiring you, you will give her to me,\\nEven as mine own, and sovereign of my life,\\nThen shall I think my travels are well spent.\\n\\nKING. With all my heart, but this--\\nSegasto claims my promise made tofore,\\nThat he should have her as his only wife,\\nBefore my council, when we came from war.\\nSegasto, may I crave thee let it pass,\\nAnd give Amadine as wife to Mucedorus.\\n\\nSEGASTO. With all my heart, were it a far greater thing,\\nAnd what I may to furnish up their rites,\\nWith pleasing sports and pastimes you shall see.\\n\\nKING.

Faith,\\nmaster, now we may go to breakfast with a woodcock-pie.\\n\\nSEGASTO. Go, sir; you were best leave this knavery.\\n\\nKING. Come on, my lords, let\\'s now to court,\\nWhere we may finish up the joyfullest day\\nThat ever happ\\'d to a distressed king.[197]\\nWith mirth and joy and great solemnity\\nWe\\'ll finish up these Hymen\\'s rites most pleasantly.\\n\\nCLOWN.

Kind sir, near-dwelling amity indeed\\nOffers the heart\\'s inquiry better view\\nThan love that\\'s seated in a farther soil:\\nAs prospectives[209], the[210] nearer that they be,\\nYield better judgment to the judging eye;\\nThings seen far off are lessened in the eye,\\nWhen their true shape is seen being hard by.\\n\\nMR BAR. True, sir, \\'tis so; and truly I esteem\\nMere[211] amity, familiar neighbourhood,\\nThe cousin german unto wedded love.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Ay, sir, there\\'s surely some alliance \\'twixt them,\\nFor they have both the offspring from the heart:\\nWithin the heart\\'s-blood-ocean still are found\\nJewels of amity and gems of love.\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, Master Goursey, I have in my time\\nSeen many shipwrecks of true honesty;\\nBut incident such dangers ever are\\nTo them that without compass sail so far:\\nWhy, what need men to swim, when they may wade?--\\nBut leave this talk, enough of this is said:\\nAnd, Master Goursey, in good faith, sir, welcome;--\\nAnd, Mistress Goursey, I am much in debt\\nUnto your kindness that would visit me.\\n\\nMRS GOUR.

Why, he will trouble you at home, forsooth,\\nOften call in, and ask ye how ye do;\\nAnd sit and chat with you all day till night,\\nAnd all night too,[213] if he might have his will.\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, wife, indeed I thank her for her kindness;\\nShe hath made me much good cheer passing that way.\\n\\nMRS BAR.

Beshrew me, but my wife\\'s jests grow too bitter;\\nPlainer speeches for her were more fitter[222]:\\nMalice lies embowelled in her tongue,\\nAnd new hatch\\'d hate makes every jest a wrong.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Look ye, mistress, now I hit ye.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Why, ay, you never use to miss a blot[223],\\nEspecially when it stands so fair to hit.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. How mean ye, Mistress Barnes?\\n\\nMRS BAR. That Mistress Goursey\\'s in the hitting vein.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. I hot[224] your man.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, ay, my man, my man; but, had I known,\\nI would have had my man stood nearer home.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Why, had ye kept your man in his right place,\\nI should not then have hit him with an ace.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Right, by the Lord! a plague upon the bones!\\n\\nMRS GOUR. And a hot mischief on the curser too!\\n\\nMR BAR. How now, wife?\\n\\nMR GOUR. Why, what\\'s the matter, woman?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. It is no matter; I am--\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, you are--\\n\\nMRS GOUR. What am I?\\n\\nMRS BAR. Why, that\\'s as you will be ever.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. That\\'s every day as good as Barnes\\'s wife.\\n\\nMRS BAR. And better too: then, what needs all this trouble?\\nA single horse is worse than that bears double.\\n\\nMR BAR. Wife, go to, have regard to what you say;\\nLet not your words pass forth the verge of reason,\\nBut keep within the bounds of modesty;\\nFor ill-report doth like a bailiff stand,\\nTo pound the straying and the wit-lost tongue,\\nAnd makes it forfeit into folly\\'s hands.\\nWell, wife, you know it is no honest part\\nTo entertain such guests with jests and wrongs:\\nWhat will the neighbouring country vulgar say,\\nWhen as they hear that you fell out at dinner?\\nForsooth, they\\'ll call it a pot-quarrel straight;\\nThe best they\\'ll name it is a woman\\'s jangling.\\nGo to, be rul\\'d, be rul\\'d.\\n\\nMRS BAR. God\\'s Lord, be rul\\'d, be rul\\'d!\\nWhat, think ye I have such a baby\\'s wit,\\nTo have a rod\\'s correction for my tongue?\\nSchool infancy! I am of age to speak,\\nAnd I know when to speak: shall I be chid\\nFor such a--\\n\\nMRS GOUR. What-a? nay, mistress, speak it out;\\nI scorn your stopp\\'d compares: compare not me\\nTo any but your equals, Mistress Barnes.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Peace, wife, be quiet.\\n\\nMR BAR. O, persuade, persuade!\\nWife, Mistress Goursey, shall I win your thoughts\\nTo composition of some kind effects?\\nWife, if you love your credit, leave this strife,\\nAnd come shake hands with Mistress Goursey here.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Shall I shake hands? let her go shake her heels;\\nShe gets nor hands nor friendship at my hands:\\nAnd so, sir, while I live, I will take heed,\\nWhat guests I bid again unto my house.\\n\\nMR BAR. Impatient woman, will you be so stiff\\nIn this absurdness?\\n\\nMRS BAR. I am impatient now I speak;\\nBut, sir, I\\'ll tell you more another time:\\nGo to, I will not take it as I have done.\\n                                             [_Exit_.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Nay, she might stay; I will not long be here\\nTo trouble her. Well, Master Barnes,\\nI am sorry that it was our haps to-day,\\nTo have our pleasures parted with this fray:\\nI am sorry too for all that is amiss,\\nEspecially that you are mov\\'d in this;\\nBut be not so, \\'tis but a woman\\'s jar:\\nTheir tongues are weapons, words their blows of war;\\n\\'Twas but a while we buffeted, you saw,\\nAnd each of us was willing to withdraw;\\nThere was no harm nor bloodshed, you did see:\\nTush, fear us not, for we shall well agree.\\nI take my leave, sir. Come, kind-hearted man,\\nThat speaks his wife so fair--ay, now and then;\\nI know you would not for an hundreth pound,\\nThat I should hear your voice\\'s churlish sound;\\nI know you have a far more milder tune\\nThan \"Peace, be quiet, wife;\" but I have done.\\nWill ye go home? the door directs the way;\\nBut, if you will not, my duty is to stay[225].\\n\\nMR BAR. Ha, ha! why, here\\'s a right woman, is there not?\\nThey both have din\\'d, yet see what stomachs they have!\\n\\nMR. GOUR. Well, Master Barnes, we cannot do withal[226]:\\nLet us be friends still--\\n\\nMR BAR. O Master Goursey, the mettle of our minds,\\nHaving the temper of true reason in them.\\nAffords[227] a better edge of argument\\nFor the maintain of our familiar loves\\nThan the soft leaden wit of women can;\\nWherefore with all the parts of neighbour-love\\nI [do] impart[228] myself to Master Goursey.\\n\\nMR GOUR. And with exchange of love I do receive it:\\nThen here we\\'ll part, partners of two curs\\'d wives.\\n\\nMR BAR. O, where shall we find a man so bless\\'d that is not?\\nBut come; your business and my home-affairs\\nMakes me deliver that unfriendly word\\n\\'Mongst friends--farewell.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Twenty farewells, sir.\\n\\nMR BAR. But hark ye, Master Goursey;\\nLook ye persuade at home, as I will do:\\nWhat, man! we must not always have them foes.\\n\\nMR GOUR. If I can help it.\\n\\nMR BAR. God help, God help!\\nWomen are even untoward creatures still.\\n\\n                                           [_Exeunt_.\\n\\n    _Enter_ PHILIP, FRANCIS, _and his_ BOY, _from bowling_.\\n\\nPHIL. Come on, Frank Goursey: you have had good luck\\nTo win the game.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, tell me, is\\'t not good,\\nThat never play\\'d before upon your green?\\n\\nPHIL. \\'Tis good, but that it cost me ten good crowns;\\nThat makes it worse.\\n\\nFRAN. Let it not grieve thee, man; come o\\'er to us;\\nWe will devise some game to make you win\\nYour money back again, sweet Philip.\\n\\nPHIL. And that shall be ere long, and if I live:\\nBut tell me, Francis, what good horses have ye,\\nTo hunt this summer?\\n\\nFRAN. Two or three jades, or so.\\n\\nPHIL. Be they but jades?\\n\\nFRAN. No, faith; my wag-string here\\nDid founder one the last time that he rid--\\nThe best grey nag that ever I laid my leg over.\\n\\nBOY. You mean the flea-bitten.\\n\\nFRAN. Good sir, the same.\\n\\nBOY. And was the same the best that e\\'er you rid on?\\n\\nFRAN. Ay, was it, sir.\\n\\nBOY. I\\'faith, it was not, sir.\\n\\nFRAN. No! where had I one so good?\\n\\nBOY. One of my colour, and a better too.\\n\\nFRAN. One of your colour? I ne\\'er remember him:\\nOne of that colour!\\n\\nBOY. Or of that complexion.\\n\\nFRAN. What\\'s that ye call complexion in a horse?\\n\\nBOY. The colour, sir.\\n\\nFRAN. Set me a colour on your jest, or I will--\\n\\nBOY. Nay, good sir, hold your hands!\\n\\nFRAN. What, shall we have it?\\n\\nBOY. Why, sir, I cannot paint.\\n\\nFRAN. Well, then, I can;\\nAnd I shall find a pencil for ye, sir.\\n\\nBOY. Then I must find the table, if you do.\\n\\nFRAN. A whoreson, barren, wicked urchin!\\n\\nBOY. Look how you chafe! you would be angry more,\\nIf I should tell it you.\\n\\nFRAN. Go to, I\\'ll anger ye, and if you do not.\\n\\nBOY. Why, sir, the horse that I do mean\\nHath a leg both straight and clean,\\nThat hath nor spaven, splint, nor flaw,\\nBut is the best that ever ye saw;\\nA pretty rising knee--O knee!\\nIt is as round as round may be;\\nThe full flank makes the buttock round:\\nThis palfrey standeth on no ground,\\nWhen as my master\\'s on her back,\\nIf that he once do say but, tack:[229]\\nAnd if he prick her, you shall see\\nHer gallop amain, she is so free;\\nAnd if he give her but a nod,\\nShe thinks it is a riding-rod;\\nAnd if he\\'ll have her softly go,\\nThen she trips it like a doe;\\nShe comes so easy with the rein,\\nA twine-thread turns her back again;\\nAnd truly I did ne\\'er see yet\\nA horse play proudlier on the bit:\\nMy master with good managing\\nBrought her first unto the ring;[230]\\nHe likewise taught her to corvet,\\nTo run, and suddenly to set;\\nShe\\'s cunning in the wild-goose race,\\nNay, she\\'s apt to every pace;\\nAnd to prove her colour good,\\nA flea, enamour\\'d of her blood,\\nDigg\\'d for channels in her neck,\\nAnd there made many a crimson speck:\\nI think there\\'s none that use to ride\\nBut can her pleasant trot abide;\\nShe goes so even upon the way,\\nShe will not stumble in a day;\\nAnd when my master--\\n\\nFRAN. What do I?\\n\\nBOY. Nay, nothing, sir.\\n\\nPHIL. O, fie, Frank, fie!\\nNay, nay, your reason hath no justice now,\\nI must needs say; persuade him first to speak,\\nThen chide him for it! Tell me, pretty wag,\\nWhere stands this prancer, in what inn or stable?\\nOr hath thy master put her out to run,\\nThen in what field, what champion,[231] feeds this courser,\\nThis well-pac\\'d, bonny steed that thou so praisest?\\n\\nBOY. Faith, sir, I think--\\n\\nFRAN. Villain, what do ye think?\\n\\nBOY. I think that you, sir, have been ask\\'d by many,\\nBut yet I never heard that ye told any.\\n\\nPHIL. Well, boy, then I will add one more to many.\\nAnd ask thy master where this jennet feeds.\\nCome, Frank, tell me--nay, prythee, tell me, Frank,\\nMy good horse-master, tell me--by this light,\\nI will not steal her from thee; if I do,\\nLet me be held a felon to thy love.\\n\\nFRAN. No, Philip, no.\\n\\nPHIL. What, wilt thou wear a point[232] but with one tag?\\nWell, Francis, well, I see you are a wag.\\n\\n    _Enter_ COOMES.\\n\\nCOOMES. \\'Swounds, where be these timber-turners,\\nthese trowl-the-bowls, these green-men, these--\\n\\nFRAN. What, what, sir?\\n\\nCOOMES. These bowlers, sir.\\n\\nFRAN. Well, sir, what say you to bowlers?\\n\\nCOOMES. Why, I say they cannot be saved.\\n\\nFRAN. Your reason, sir?\\n\\nCOOMES. Because they throw away their souls at every mark.\\n\\nFRAN. Their souls! how mean ye?\\n\\nPHIL. Sirrah, he means the soul of the bowl.\\n\\nFRAN. Lord, how his wit holds bias like a bowl!\\n\\nCOOMES. Well, which is the bias?\\n\\nFRAN. This next to you.\\n\\nCOOMES. Nay, turn it this way, then the bowl goes true.\\n\\nBOY. Rub, rub!\\n\\nCOOMES. Why rub?\\n\\nBOY. Why, you overcast the mark, and miss the way.\\n\\nCOOMES. Nay, boy, I use to take the fairest of my play.\\n\\nPHIL. Dick Coomes, methinks thou art[233] very pleasant:\\nWhere[234] got\\'st thou this merry humour?\\n\\nCOOMES. In your father\\'s cellar, the merriest place in th\\' house.\\n\\nPHIL. Then you have been carousing hard?\\n\\nCOOMES. Yes, faith, \\'tis our custom, when your father\\'s men and we meet.\\n\\nPHIL. Thou art very welcome thither, Dick.\\n\\nCOOMES. By God, I thank ye, sir, I thank ye, sir: by God, I have a quart\\nof wine for ye, sir, in any place of the world. There shall not a\\nservingman in Barkshire fight better for ye than I will do, if you have\\nany quarrel in hand: you shall have the maidenhead of my new sword; I\\npaid a quarter\\'s wages for\\'t, by Jesus.\\n\\nPHIL. O, this meat-failer Dick!\\nHow well\\'t has made the apparel of his wit,\\nAnd brought it into fashion of an honour!\\nPrythee, Dick Coomes, but tell me how thou dost?\\n\\nCOOMES. Faith, sir, like a poor man of service.\\n\\nPHIL. Or servingman.\\n\\nCOOMES. Indeed, so called by the vulgar.\\n\\nPHIL. Why, where the devil hadst thou that word?\\n\\nCOOMES. O, sir, you have the most eloquent ale in all the[235] world;\\nour blunt soil affords none such.\\n\\nFRAN. Philip, leave talking with this drunken fool. Say, sirrah,\\nwhere\\'s my father?\\n\\nCOOMES. \"Marry, I thank ye for my very good cheer,--O Lord, it is not\\nso much worth.--You see I am bold with ye.--Indeed, you are not so bold\\nas welcome; I pray ye, come oft\\'ner.--Truly, I shall trouble ye.\" All\\nthese ceremonies are despatch\\'d between them, and they are gone.\\n\\nFRAN. Are they so?\\n\\nCOOMES. Ay, before God, are they.\\n\\nFRAN. And wherefore came not you to call me then?\\n\\nCOOMES. Because I was loth to change my game.\\n\\nFRAN. What game?\\n\\nCOOMES. You were at one sort of bowls as I was at another.\\n\\nPHIL. Sirrah, he means the butt\\'ry bowls of beer.\\n\\nCOOMES. By God, sir, we tickled it.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, what a swearing keeps this drunken ass?\\nCanst thou not say but swear at every word?\\n\\nPHIL. Peace, do not mar his humour, prythee, Frank.\\n\\nCOOMES. Let him alone; he\\'s a springall; he knows not what belongs\\nto an oath.\\n\\nFRAN. Sirrah, be quiet, or I do protest--\\n\\nCOOMES. Come, come, what do you protest?\\n\\nFRAN. By heaven, to crack your crown.\\n\\nCOOMES. To crack my crown! I lay ye a crown of that, lay it down, and\\nye dare; nay, \\'sblood, I\\'ll venture a quarter\\'s wages of that. Crack my\\ncrown, quotha!\\n\\nFRAN. Will ye not yet be quiet? will ye urge me?\\n\\nCOOMES. Urge ye, with a pox! who urges ye? You might have said so much\\nto a clown, or one that had not been o\\'er the sea to see fashions: I\\nhave, I tell ye true; and I know what belongs to a man. Crack my crown,\\nand ye can.\\n\\nFRAN. And I can, ye rascal!\\n\\nPHIL. Hold, hair-brain, hold! dost thou not see he\\'s drunk?\\n\\nCOOMES. Nay, let him come: though he be my master\\'s son, I am my\\nmaster\\'s man, and a man is a man in any ground of England. Come, and he\\ndares, a comes upon his death: I will not budge an inch, no, \\'sblood,\\nwill I[236] not.\\n\\nFRAN. Will ye not?\\n\\nPHIL. Stay, prythee, Frank. Coomes, dost thou hear?\\n\\nCOOMES. Hear me no hears: stand away, I\\'ll trust none of you all. If I\\nhave my back against a cartwheel, I would not care if the devil came.\\n\\nPHIL. Why, ye fool, I am your friend.\\n\\nCOOMES. Fool on your face! I have a wife.\\n\\nFRAN. She\\'s a whore, then.\\n\\nCOOMES. She\\'s as honest as Nan Lawson.\\n\\nPHIL. What\\'s she?\\n\\nCOOMES. One of his whores.\\n\\nPHIL. Why, hath he so many?\\n\\nCOOMES. Ay, as many as there be churches in London.\\n\\nPHIL. Why, that\\'s a hundred and nine.\\n\\nBOY. Faith, he lies a hundred.\\n\\nPHIL. Then thou art a witness to nine.\\n\\nBOY. No, by God, I\\'ll be witness to none.\\n\\nCOOMES. Now do I stand like the George at Colebrook.\\n\\nBOY. No, thou stand\\'st like the Bull at St Alban\\'s.\\n\\nCOOMES. Boy, ye lie--the Horns.[237]\\n\\nBOY. The bull\\'s bitten; see, how he butts!\\n\\nPHIL. Coomes, Coomes, put up;[238] my friend and thou art friends.\\n\\nCOOMES. I\\'ll hear him say so first.\\n\\nPHIL. Frank, prythee, do; be friends, and tell him so.\\n\\nFRAN. Go to, I am.\\n\\nBOY. Put up, sir; and ye be a man, put up.\\n\\nCOOMES. I am easily persuaded, boy.\\n\\nPHIL. Ah, ye mad slave!\\n\\nCOOMES. Come, come, a couple of whoremasters I found ye,\\nand so I leave ye.\\n                      [_Exit_.\\n\\nPHIL. Lo, Frank, dost thou not see he\\'s drunk,\\nThat twits thee[239] with thy disposition?\\n\\nFRAN. What disposition?\\n\\nPHIL. Nan Lawson, Nan Lawson.\\n\\nFRAN. Nay, then--\\n\\nPHIL. Go to, ye wag, \\'tis well:\\nIf ever ye get a wife, i\\'faith I\\'ll tell.\\nSirrah, at home we have a servingman;\\nHe is[240] not humour\\'d bluntly as Coomes is,\\nYet his condition[241] makes me often merry:\\nI\\'ll tell thee, sirrah, he\\'s a fine neat fellow,\\nA spruce slave; I warrant ye, he will[242] have\\nHis cruel garters[243] cross about the knee,\\nHis woollen hose as white as th\\'driven snow,\\nHis shoes dry-leather neat, and tied with red ribbons,\\nA nosegay bound with laces in his hat--\\nBridelaces, sir--and his hat all green[244],\\nGreen coverlet for such a grass-green wit.\\n\"The goose that grazeth on the green,\" quoth he,\\n\"May I eat on, when you shall buried be!\"\\nAll proverbs is his speech, he\\'s proverbs all.\\n\\nFRAN. Why speaks he proverbs?\\n\\nPHIL. Because he would speak truth,\\nAnd proverbs, you\\'ll confess, are old-said sooth.\\n\\nFRAN. I like this well, and one day I will see him:\\nBut shall we part?\\n\\nPHIL. Not yet, I\\'ll bring ye somewhat on your way,\\nAnd as we go, between your boy and you\\nI\\'ll know where that brave prancer stands at livery.\\n\\nFRAN. Come, come, you shall not.\\n\\nPHIL. I\\'faith, I will.\\n\\n                          [_Exeunt_.\\n\\n    _Enter_ MASTER BARNES _and his Wife_.\\n\\nMR BAR. Wife, in my mind to-day you were to blame,\\nAlthough my patience did not blame ye for it:\\nMethought the rules of love and neighbourhood\\nDid not direct your thoughts; all indiscreet[245]\\nWere your proceedings in the entertain\\nOf them that I invited to my house.\\nNay, stay, I do not chide, but counsel, wife,\\nAnd in the mildest manner that I may:\\nYou need not view me with a servant\\'s eye,\\nWhose vassal[246] senses tremble at the look\\nOf his displeased master. O my wife,\\nYou are myself! when self sees fault in self,\\nSelf is sin-obstinate, if self amend not:\\nIndeed, I saw a fault in thee myself,\\nAnd it hath set a foil upon thy fame,\\nNot as the foil doth grace the diamond.\\n\\nMRS BAR. What fault, sir, did you see in me to-day?\\n\\nMR BAR. O, do not set the organ of thy voice\\nOn such a grunting key of discontent!\\nDo not deform the beauty of thy tongue\\nWith such misshapen answers. Rough wrathful words\\nAre bastards got by rashness in the thoughts:\\nFair demeanours are virtue\\'s nuptial babes,\\nThe offspring of the well-instructed soul;\\nO, let them call thee mother, then, my wife!\\nSo seem not barren of good courtesy.\\n\\nMRS BAR. So; have ye done?\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, and I had done well,\\nIf you would do what I advise for well.\\n\\nMRS BAR. What\\'s that?\\n\\nMR BAR. Which is, that you would be good friends\\nWith Mistress Goursey.\\n\\nMRS BAR. With Mistress Goursey!\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, sweet wife.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Not so, sweet husband.\\n\\nMR BAR. Could you but show me any grounded cause.\\n\\nMRS BAR. The grounded cause I ground, because I will not.\\n\\nMR BAR. Your will hath little reason, then, I think.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Yes, sir, my reason equalleth my will.\\n\\nMR BAR. Let\\'s hear your reason, for your will is great.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Why, for I will not.\\n\\nMR BAR. Is all your reason \"for I will not,\" wife?\\nNow, by my soul, I held ye for more wise,\\nDiscreet, and of more temp\\'rature in sense,\\nThan in a sullen humour to affect\\nThat woman\\'s[247] will--borne, common, scholar phrase:\\nOft have I heard a timely-married girl,\\nThat newly left to call her mother mam,\\nHer father dad: but yesterday come from\\n\"That\\'s my good girl, God send thee a good husband!\"\\nAnd now being taught to speak the name of husband,\\nWill, when she would be wanton in her will,\\nIf her husband ask\\'d her why, say \"for I will.\"\\nHave I chid men for[248] [an] unmanly choice,\\nThat would not fit their years? have I seen thee\\nPupil such green young things, and with thy counsel\\nTutor their wits? and art thou now infected\\nWith this disease of imperfection?\\nI blush for thee, ashamed at thy shame.\\n\\nMRS BAR. A shame on her that makes thee rate me so!\\n\\nMR BAR. O black-mouth\\'d rage, thy breath is boisterous,\\nAnd thou mak\\'st virtue shake at this high storm!\\nShe is[249] of good report; I know thou know\\'st it.\\n\\nMRS BAR. She is not, nor I know not, but I know\\nThat thou dost love her, therefore think\\'st her so;\\nThou bear\\'st with her, because she bears with thee.\\nThou may\\'st be ashamed to stand in her defence:\\nShe is a strumpet, and thou art no honest man\\nTo stand in her defence against thy wife.\\nIf I catch her in my walk, now, by Cock\\'s[250] bones,\\nI\\'ll scratch out both her eyes.\\n\\nMR BAR. O God!\\n\\nMRS BAR. Nay, never say \"O God\" for the matter:\\nThou art the cause; thou bad\\'st her to my house,\\nOnly to blear the eyes of Goursey, did\\'st not?\\nBut I will send him word, I warrant thee,\\nAnd ere I sleep too, trust upon it, sir.\\n                                        [_Exit_.\\n\\nMR BAR. Methinks this is a mighty fault in her;\\nI could be angry with her: O, if I be so,\\nI shall but put a link unto a torch,\\nAnd so give greater light to see her fault.\\nI\\'ll rather smother it in melancholy:\\nNay, wisdom bids me shun that passion;\\nThen I will study for a remedy.\\nI have a daughter,--now, heaven invocate,\\nShe be not of like spirit as her mother!\\nIf so, she\\'ll be a plague unto her husband,\\nIf that he be not patient and discreet,\\nFor that I hold the ease of all such trouble.\\nWell, well, I would my daughter had a husband,\\nFor I would see how she would demean herself\\nIn that estate; it may be, ill enough,--\\nAnd, so God shall help me, well-remembered now!\\nFrank Goursey is his father\\'s son and heir:\\nA youth that in my heart I have good hope on;\\nMy senses say a match, my soul applauds\\nThe motion: O, but his lands are great,\\nHe will look high; why, I will strain myself\\nTo make her dowry equal with his land.\\nGood faith, and \\'twere a match, \\'twould be a means\\nTo make their mothers friends. I\\'ll call my daughter,\\nTo see how she\\'s dispos\\'d to marriage.--\\nMall, where are ye?\\n\\n    _Enter_ MALL.\\n\\nMALL. Father, here I am.\\n\\nMR BAR. Where is your mother?\\n\\nMALL. I saw her not, forsooth, since you and she\\nWent walking both together to the garden.\\n\\nMR BAR. Dost thou hear me, girl? I must dispute with thee.\\n\\nMALL. Father, the question then must not be hard,\\nFor I am very weak in argument.\\n\\nMR BAR. Well, this it is; I say \\'tis good to marry.\\n\\nMALL. And this say I, \\'tis not good to marry.\\n\\nMR BAR. Were it not good, then all men would not marry;\\nBut now they do.\\n\\nMALL. Marry, not all; but it is good to marry.\\n\\nMR BAR. Is it both good and bad; how can this be?\\n\\nMALL. Why, it is good to them that marry well;\\nTo them that marry ill, no greater hell.\\n\\nMR BAR. If thou might marry well, wouldst thou agree?\\n\\nMALL. I cannot tell; heaven must appoint for me.\\n\\nMR BAR. Wench, I am studying for thy good indeed.\\n\\nMALL. My hopes and duty wish your thoughts good speed.\\n\\nMR BAR. But tell me, wench, hast thou a mind to marry?\\n\\nMALL. This question is too hard for bashfulness;\\nAnd, father, now ye pose my modesty.\\nI am a maid, and when ye ask me thus,\\nI, like a maid, must blush, look pale and wan,\\nAnd then look red[251] again; for we change colour,\\nAs our thoughts change. With true-fac\\'d passion\\nOf modest maidenhead I could adorn me,\\nAnd to your question make a sober cour\\'sey,\\nAnd with close-clipp\\'d civility be silent;\\nOr else say \"No, forsooth,\" or \"Ay, forsooth.\"\\nIf I said, \"No, forsooth,\" I lied forsooth:\\nTo lie upon myself were deadly sin,\\nTherefore I will speak truth and shame the devil.\\nFather, when first I heard ye name a husband,\\nAt that same very time my spirits quickened.\\nDespair before had kill\\'d them, they were dead:\\nBecause it was my hap so long to tarry,\\nI was persuaded I should never marry;\\nAnd sitting sewing thus upon the ground,\\nI fell in trance of meditation;\\nBut coming to myself, \"O Lord,\" said I,\\n\"Shall it be so I must I unmarried die?\"\\nAnd, being angry, father, farther, said--\\n\"Now, by Saint Anne, I will not die a maid!\"\\nGood faith, before I came to this ripe growth,\\nI did accuse the labouring time of sloth;\\nMethought the year did run but slow about,\\nFor I thought each year ten I was without.\\nBeing fourteen and toward the tother year,\\nGood Lord, thought I, fifteen will ne\\'er be here!\\nFor I have heard my mother say that then\\nPretty maids were fit for handsome men:\\nFifteen past, sixteen, and seventeen too,\\nWhat, thought I, will not this husband do?\\nWill no man marry me? have men forsworn\\nSuch beauty and such youth? shall youth be worn\\nAs rich men\\'s gowns, more with age than use?\\nWhy, then I let restrained fancy loose,\\nAnd bad it gaze for pleasure; then love swore me\\nTo do whate\\'er my mother did before me;\\nYet, in good faith, I have been very loth,\\nBut now it lies in you to save my oath:\\nIf I shall have a husband, get him quickly,\\nFor maids that wear cork shoes may step awry.\\n\\nMR BAR. Believe me, wench, I do not reprehend[252] thee,\\nBut for this pleasant answer do commend thee.\\nI must confess, love doth thee mighty wrong,\\nBut I will see thee have thy right ere long;\\nI know a young man, whom I hold most fit\\nTo have thee both for living and for wit:\\nI will go write about it presently.\\n\\nMALL. Good father, do.    [_Exit_ [BARNES].\\n                       O God, methinks I should\\nWife it as fine as any woman could!\\nI could carry a port to be obeyed,\\nCarry a mastering eye upon my maid,\\nWith \"Minion, do your business, or I\\'ll make ye,\"\\nAnd to all house authority betake me.\\nO God! would I were married! by my troth,\\nBut if I be not, I swear I\\'ll keep my oath.\\n\\n    _Enter_ MRS BARNES.\\n\\nMRS BAR. How now, minion, where have you been gadding?\\n\\nMALL. Forsooth, my father called me forth to him.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Your father! and what said he to ye, I pray?\\n\\nMALL. Nothing, forsooth.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Nothing! that cannot be; something he said.\\n\\nMALL. Ay, something that as good as nothing was.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Come, let me hear that something-nothing, then.\\n\\nMALL. Nothing but of a husband for me, mother.\\n\\nMRS BAR. A husband! that was something; but what husband?\\n\\nMALL. Nay, faith, I know not, mother: would I did!\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, \"would ye did!\" i\\'faith, are ye so hasty?\\n\\nMALL. Hasty, mother! why, how old am I?\\n\\nMRS BAR. Too young to marry.\\n\\nMALL. Nay, by the mass, ye lie.\\nMother, how old were you when you did marry?\\n\\nMRS BAR. How old soe\\'er I was, yet you shall tarry.\\n\\nMALL. Then the worse for me. Hark, mother, hark!\\nThe priest forgets that e\\'er he was a clerk:\\nWhen you were at my years, I\\'ll hold my life,\\nYour mind was to change maidenhead for wife.\\nPardon me, mother, I am of your mind,\\nAnd, by my troth, I take it but by kind.[253]\\n\\nMRS BAR. Do ye hear, daughter? you shall stay my leisure.\\n\\nMALL. Do you hear, mother? would you stay from pleasure,\\nWhen ye have mind to it? Go to, there\\'s no wrong\\nLike this, to let maids lie alone so long:\\nLying alone they muse but in their beds,\\nHow they might lose their long-kept maidenheads.\\nThis is the cause there is so many scapes,\\nFor women that are wise will not lead apes\\nIn hell: I tell ye, mother, I say true;\\nTherefore come husband: maidenhead adieu!            [_Exit_.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Well, lusty guts, I mean to make ye stay,\\nAnd set some rubs in your mind\\'s smoothest way[254].\\n\\n    _Enter_ PHILIP.\\n\\nPHIL. Mother--\\n\\nMRS BAR. How now, sirrah; where have you been walking?\\n\\nPHIL. Over the meads, half-way to Milton, mother,\\nTo bear my friend, Frank Goursey, company.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Where\\'s your blue coat[255], your sword and buckler, sir?\\nGet you such like habit for a serving-man,\\nIf you will wait upon the brat of Goursey.\\n\\nPHIL. Mother, that you are mov\\'d, this makes me wonder;\\nWhen I departed, I did leave ye friends:\\nWhat undigested jar hath since betided?\\n\\nMRS BAR. Such as almost doth choke thy mother, boy,\\nAnd stifles her with the conceit of it;\\nI am abus\\'d, my son, by Goursey\\'s wife.\\n\\nPHIL. By Mistress Goursey.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Mistress Flirt--yea[256], foul strumpet,\\nLight-a-love, short-heels! Mistress Goursey\\nCall her again, and thou wert better no.\\n\\nPHIL. O my dear mother, have some patience!\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, sir, have patience, and see your father\\nTo rifle up the treasure of my love,\\nAnd play the spendthrift upon such an harlot!\\nThis same will make me have patience, will it not?\\n\\nPHIL. This same is women\\'s most impatience:\\nYet, mother, I have often heard ye say,\\nThat you have found my father temperate,\\nAnd ever free from such affections.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, till[257] my too much love did glut his thoughts,\\nAnd make him seek for change.\\n\\nPHIL. O, change your mind!\\nMy father bears more cordial love to you.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Thou liest, thou liest, for he loves Goursey\\'s wife,\\nNot me.\\n\\nPHIL. Now I swear, mother, you are much to blame;\\nI durst be sworn he loves you as his soul.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Wilt thou be pampered by affection?\\nWill nature teach thee such vild[258] perjury?\\nWilt thou be sworn, ay, forsworn,[259] careless boy?\\nAnd if thou swear\\'t, I say he loves me not.\\n\\nPHIL. [Mother] he loves[260] ye but too well, I swear,\\nUnless ye knew much better how to use him.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Doth he so, sir? thou unnatural boy!\\n\"Too well,\" sayest thou? that word shall cost thee[261] somewhat:\\nO monstrous! have I brought thee up to this?\\n\"Too well!\" O unkind, wicked, and degenerate,\\nHast thou the heart to say so of thy mother?\\nWell, God will plague thee for\\'t, I warrant thee:\\nOut on thee, villain! fie upon thee, wretch!\\nOut of my sight, out of my sight, I say!\\n\\nPHIL. This air is pleasant, and doth please me well,\\nAnd here I will stay.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Wilt thou, stubborn villain?\\n\\n    _Enter_ MR BARNES.\\n\\nMR BAR. How now, what\\'s the matter?\\n\\nMRS BAR. Thou sett\\'st thy son to scoff and mock at me:\\nIs\\'t not sufficient I am wrong\\'d of thee,\\nBut he must be an agent to abuse me?\\nMust I be subject to my cradle too?\\nO God, O God, amend it!\\n                           [_Exit_.\\n\\nMR BAR. Why, how now, Philip? is this true, my son?\\n\\nPHIL. Dear father, she is much impatient:\\nNe\\'er let that hand assist me in my need,\\nIf I more said than that she thought amiss\\nTo think that you were so licentious given;\\nAnd thus much more, when she inferr\\'d it more,\\nI swore an oath you lov\\'d her but too well:\\nIn that as guilty I do hold myself.\\nNow that I come to more considerate trial,\\nI know my fault: I should have borne with her:\\nBlame me for rashness, then, not for want of duty.\\n\\nMR BAR. I do absolve thee; and come hither, Philip:\\nI have writ a letter unto Master Goursey,\\nAnd I will tell thee the contents thereof;\\nBut tell me first, think\\'st thou Frank Goursey loves thee?\\n\\nPHIL. If that a man devoted to a man,\\nLoyal, religious in love\\'s hallowed vows--\\nIf that a man that is sole laboursome\\nTo work his own thoughts to his friend\\'s delight,\\nMay purchase good opinion with his friend,\\nThen I may say, I have done this so well,\\nThat I may think Frank Goursey loves me well.\\n\\nMR BAR. \\'Tis well; and I am much deceived in him,\\nAnd if he be not sober, wise, and valiant.\\n\\nPHIL. I hope my father takes me for thus wise,\\nI will not glue myself in love to one\\nThat hath not some desert of virtue in him:\\nWhate\\'er you think of him, believe me, father,\\nHe will be answerable to your thoughts\\nIn any quality commendable.\\n\\nMR BAR. Thou cheer\\'st my hopes in him; and, in good faith,\\nThou\\'st[262] made my love complete unto thy friend:\\nPhilip, I love him, and I love him so,\\nI could afford him a good wife, I know.\\n\\nPHIL. Father, a wife!\\n\\nMR BAR. Philip, a wife.\\n\\nPHIL. I lay my life--my sister!\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, in good faith.\\n\\nPHIL. Then, father, he shall have her; he shall, I swear.\\n\\nMR BAR. How canst thou say so, knowing not his mind?\\n\\nPHIL. All\\'s one for that; I will go to him straight.\\nFather, if you would seek this seven-years\\'-day,\\nYou could not find a fitter match for her;\\nAnd he shall have her, I swear he shall;\\nHe were as good be hanged, as once deny[263] her.\\nI\\'faith, I\\'ll to him.\\n\\nMR BAR. Hairbrain, hairbrain, stay!\\nAs yet we do not know his father\\'s mind:\\nWhy, what will Master Goursey say, my son,\\nIf we should motion it without his knowledge?\\nGo to, he\\'s a wise and discreet gentleman,\\nAnd that expects from me all honest parts;\\nNor shall he fail his expectation;\\nFirst I do mean to make him privy to it:\\nPhilip, this letter is to that effect.\\n\\nPHIL. Father, for God\\'s[264] sake, send it quickly, then:\\nI\\'ll call your man. What, Hugh! where\\'s Hugh, there, ho?\\n\\nMR BAR. Philip, if this would prove a match,\\nIt were the only means that could be found\\nTo make thy mother friends with Mistress Goursey.\\n\\nPHIL. How, a match! I\\'ll warrant ye, a match.\\nMy sister\\'s fair, Frank Goursey he is rich;\\nHer[265] dowry, too, will be sufficient;\\nFrank\\'s young,[266] and youth is apt to love;\\nAnd, by my troth, my sister\\'s maidenhead\\nStands like a game at tennis: if the ball\\nHit into the hole, or hazard, farewell all:\\n\\nMR BAR. How now, where\\'s Hugh?\\n\\n    [_Enter_ NICHOLAS.]\\n\\nPHIL. Why, what doth this proverbial with us?\\nWhy, where\\'s Hugh?\\n\\nMR BAR. Peace, peace.\\n\\nPHIL. Where\\'s Hugh, I say?\\n\\nMR BAR. Be not so hasty, Philip.\\n\\nPHIL. Father, let me alone,\\nI do it but to make myself some sport.\\nThis formal fool, your man, speaks nought but proverbs,\\nAnd speak men what they can to him, he\\'ll answer\\nWith some rhyme-rotten sentence or old saying,\\nSuch spokes as th\\'ancient of the parish use,\\nWith, \"Neighbour, \\'tis an old proverb and a true,\\nGoose giblets are good meat, old sack better than new;\"\\nThen says another, \"Neighbour, that is true;\"\\nAnd when each man hath drunk his gallon round--\\nA penny pot, for that\\'s the old man\\'s gallon--\\nThen doth he lick his lips, and stroke his beard,\\nThat\\'s glued together with his slavering drops\\nOf yeasty ale, and when he scarce can trim\\nHis gouty fingers, thus he\\'ll phillip it,\\nAnd with a rotten hem, say, \"Ay, my hearts,\\nMerry go sorry! cock and pie, my hearts\"!\\nBut then their saving penny proverb comes,\\nAnd that is this, \"They that will to the wine,\\nBy\\'r Lady[267] mistress, shall lay their penny to mine.\"\\nThis was one of this penny-father\\'s[268] bastards,\\nFor, on my life, he was never[269] begot\\nWithout the consent of some great proverb-monger.\\n\\nMR BAR. O, ye are a wag.\\n\\nPHIL. Well, now unto my business.\\n\\'Swounds, will that mouth, that\\'s made of old-said saws\\nAnd nothing else, say nothing to us now?\\n\\nNICH. O Master Philip, forbear; you must not leap over the stile, before\\nyou come at it; haste makes waste; soft fire makes sweet malt; not too\\nfast for falling; there\\'s no haste to hang true men.[270]\\n\\nPHIL. Father, we ha\\'t, ye see, we ha\\'t. Now will I see if my memory will\\nserve for some proverbs too. O--a painted cloth were as well worth a\\nshilling as a thief worth a halter; well, after my hearty commendations,\\nas I was at the making hereof; so it is, that I hope as you speed, so\\nyou\\'re sure; a swift horse will tire, but he that trots easily will\\nendure. You have most learnedly proverb\\'d it, commending the virtue of\\npatience or forbearance, but yet, you know, forbearance is no quittance.\\n\\nNICH. I promise ye, Master Philip, you have spoken as true as steel.\\n\\nPHIL. Father, there\\'s a proverb well applied.\\n\\nNICH. And it seemeth unto me, ay, it seems to me, that you, Master\\nPhilip, mock me: do you not know, _qui mocat mocabitur_? mock age,\\nand see how it will prosper.\\n\\nPHIL. Why, ye whoreson proverb-book bound up in folio,\\nHave ye no other sense to answer me\\nBut every word a proverb? no other English?\\nWell, I\\'ll fulfil a proverb on thee straight.\\n\\nNICH. What is it, sir?\\n\\nPHIL. I\\'ll fetch my fist from thine ear.\\n\\nNICH. Bear witness, he threatens me!\\n\\nPHIL. That same is the coward\\'s common proverb.\\nBut come, come, sirrah, tell me where Hugh is.\\n\\nNICH. I may, and I will; I need not, except I list; you shall not\\ncommand me, you give me neither meat, drink, nor wages; I am your\\nfather\\'s man, and a man\\'s a man, and a have but a hose on his head;\\ndo not misuse me so, do not; for though he that is bound must obey,\\nyet he that will not tarry, may[271] run away--so he may.\\n\\nMR BAR. Peace, Nick, I\\'ll see he shall use thee well;\\nGo to, peace, sirrah: here, Nick, take this letter,\\nCarry it to him to whom it is directed.\\n\\nNICH. To whom is it?\\n\\nMR BAR. Why, read it: canst thou read?\\n\\nNICH. Forsooth, though none of the best, yet meanly.\\n\\nMR BAR. Why, dost thou not use it?\\n\\nNICH. Forsooth, as use makes perfectness, so seldom seen is soon\\nforgotten.\\n\\nMR BAR. Well-said: but go; it is to Master Goursey.\\n\\nPHIL. Now, sir, what proverb have ye to deliver a letter?\\n\\nNICH. What need you to care? who speaks to you? you may speak when ye\\nare spoken to, and keep your wind to cool your pottage. Well, well, you\\nare my master\\'s son, and you look for his land; but they that hope for\\ndead men\\'s shoes may hap go barefoot: take heed, as soon goes the young\\nsheep to the pot as the old. I pray God save my master\\'s life, for\\nseldom comes the better!\\n\\nPHIL. O, he hath given it me! Farewell, Proverbs.\\n\\nNICH. Farewell, frost.[272]\\n\\nPHIL. Shall I fling an old shoe after ye?\\n\\nNICH. No; you should say, God send fair weather after me!\\n\\nPHIL. I mean for good luck.\\n\\nNICH. A good luck on ye!\\n                            [_Exit_.\\n\\nMR BAR. Alas, poor fool! he uses all his wit.\\nPhilip, in faith[273] this mirth hath cheered thought,\\nAnd cosen\\'d it of his right play of passion.\\nGo after Nick, and, when thou think\\'st he\\'s there,\\nGo in and urge to that which I have writ:\\nI\\'ll in these meadows make a circling walk,\\nAnd in my meditation conjure so,\\nAs that same[274] fiend of thought, self-eating anger,\\nShall by my spells of reason[275] vanish quite:\\nAway, and let me hear from thee to-night.\\n\\nPHIL. To-night! yes, that you shall: but hark ye, father;\\nLook that you my sister waking keep,\\nFor Frank, I swear, shall kiss her, ere I sleep.\\n\\n                                               [_Exeunt_.\\n\\n    _Enter_ FRANK _and_ BOY.\\n\\nFRAN. I am very dry with walking o\\'er the green.--\\nButler, some beer! Sirrah, call the butler.\\n\\nBOY. Nay, faith, sir, we must have some smith to give the butler a\\ndrench, or cut him in the forehead, for he hath got a horse\\'s disease,\\nnamely the staggers; to-night he\\'s a good huswife, he reels all that he\\nwrought to-day; and he were good now to play at dice, for he casts[276]\\nexcellent well.\\n\\nFRAN. How mean\\'st thou? is he drunk?\\n\\nBOY. I cannot tell; but I am sure he hath more liquor in him than a\\nwhole dicker of hides; he\\'s soak\\'d throughly, i\\'faith.\\n\\nFRAN. Well, go and call him; bid him bring me drink.\\n\\nBOY. I will, sir.\\n                     [_Exit_.\\n\\nFRAN. My mother pouts, and will look merrily\\nNeither upon my father nor on me:\\nHe says she fell out with Mistress Barnes to-day;\\nThen I am sure they\\'ll not be quickly friends.\\nGood Lord, what kind of creatures women are!\\nTheir love is lightly[277] won and lightly lost;\\nAnd then their hate is deadly and extreme:\\nHe that doth take a wife betakes himself\\nTo all the cares and troubles of the world.\\nNow her disquietness doth grieve my father,\\nGrieves me, and troubles all the house besides.\\nWhat, shall I have some drink?

Marry, sir, where he was even now, asleep; but I wak\\'d him, and\\nwhen he wak\\'d he thought he was in Master Barnes\\'s buttery, for he\\nstretch\\'d himself thus, and yawning, said, \"Nick, honest Nick, fill a\\nfresh bowl of ale; stand to it, Nick, and thou beest a man of God\\'s\\nmaking, stand to it;\" and then I winded my horn, and he\\'s horn-mad.\\n\\n    _Enter_ HODGE.\\n\\nHOD. Boy, hey! ho, boy! and thou beest a man, draw.--O, here\\'s a blessed\\nmoonshine, God be thanked!--Boy, is not this goodly weather for barley?\\n\\nBOY. Spoken like a right malster, Hodge: but dost thou hear? thou art\\nnot drunk?\\n\\nHOD. No, I scorn that, i\\'faith.\\n\\nBOY.[278] But thy fellow Dick Coomes is mightily drunk.\\n\\nHOD. Drunk! a plague on it, when a man cannot carry his drink well!\\n\\'sblood, I\\'ll stand to it.\\n\\nBOY. Hold, man; see, and thou canst stand first.\\n\\nHOD. Drunk! he\\'s a beast, and he be drunk; there\\'s no man that is a\\nsober man will be drunk; he\\'s a boy, and he be drunk.\\n\\nBOY. No, he\\'s a man as thou art.\\n\\nHOD. Thus \\'tis, when a man will not be ruled by his friends: I bad him\\nkeep under the lee, but he kept down the weather two bows; I told him he\\nwould be taken with a planet, but the wisest of us all may fall.\\n\\nBOY. True, Hodge.    [_Boy trips him_.\\n\\nHOD. Whoop! lend me thy hand, Dick, I am fall\\'n into a well; lend me thy\\nhand, I shall be drowned else.\\n\\nBOY. Hold fast by the bucket, Hodge.\\n\\nHOD. A rope on it!\\n\\nBOY. Ay, there is a rope on it; but where art thou, Hodge?\\n\\nHOD. In a well; I prythee, draw up.\\n\\nBOY. Come, give up thy body; wind up, hoist\\n\\nHOD. I am over head and ears.\\n\\nBOY. In all, Hodge, in all.\\n\\nFRAN. How loathsome is this beast-man\\'s shape to me,\\nThis mould of reason so unreasonable!--\\nSirrah, why dost thou trip him down, seeing he\\'s drunk?\\n\\nBOY. Because, sir, I would have drunkards cheap.[279]\\n\\nFRAN. How mean ye?\\n\\nBOY. Why, they say that, when anything hath a fall, it is cheap; and so\\nof drunkards.\\n\\nFRAN. Go to, help him up: [_Knocking without_] but, hark, who knocks?\\n\\n                         [BOY _goes to the door, and returns_.]\\n\\nBOY. Sir, here\\'s one of Master Barnes\\'s men with a letter to my old\\nmaster.\\n\\nFRAN. Which of them is it?\\n\\nBOY. They call him Nicholas, sir.\\n\\nFRAN.

Look ye, sirrah, where your fellow lies:\\nHe\\'s[280] in a fine taking, is he not?\\n\\nCOOMES. Whoop, Hodge! where art thou, man, where art thou?\\n\\nHOD. O, in a well.\\n\\nCOOMES. In a well, man! nay, then, thou art deep in understanding.\\n\\nFRAN. Ay, once to-day you were almost so, sir.\\n\\nCOOMES. Who, I! go to, young master, I do not like this humour in ye, I\\ntell ye true; give every man his due, and give him no more: say I was\\nin such a case! go to, \\'tis the greatest indignation that can be offered\\nto a man; and, but a man\\'s more godlier given, you were able to make him\\nswear out his heart-blood. What, though that honest Hodge have cut his\\nfinger here, or, as some say, cut a feather: what, though he be mump,\\nmisled, blind, or as it were--\\'tis no consequent to me: you know I have\\ndrunk all the ale-houses in Abington dry, and laid the taps on the\\ntables, when I had done: \\'sblood, I\\'ll challenge all the true rob-pots\\nin Europe to leap up to the chin in a barrel of beer, and if I cannot\\ndrink it down to my foot, ere I leave, and then set the tap in the midst\\nof the house, and then turn a good turn on the toe on it, let me be\\ncounted nobody, a pingler,[281]--nay, let me be[282] bound to drink\\nnothing but small-beer seven years after--and I had as lief be hanged.\\n\\n    _Enter_ NICHOLAS.\\n\\nFRAN. Peace, sir, I must speak with one.--\\nNicholas, I think, your name is.\\n\\nNlCH. True as the skin between your brows.\\n\\nFRAN. Well, how doth thy master?\\n\\nNlCH. Forsooth, live, and the best doth no better.\\n\\nFRAN. Where is the letter he hath sent me?\\n\\nNlCH. _Ecce signum_! here it is.\\n\\nFRAN. \\'Tis right as Philip said, \\'tis a fine fool    [_Aside_].\\n--This letter is directed to my father;\\nI\\'ll carry it to him.

Nicholas,\\ngive me thy hand: shall we be merry? and we shall, say but we shall, and\\nlet the first word stand.\\n\\nNICH. Indeed, as long lives the merry man as the sad; an ounce of debt\\nwill not pay a pound of care.\\n\\nCOOMES. Nay, a pound of care will not pay an ounce of debt.\\n\\nNICH. Well, \\'tis a good horse never stumbles: but who lies here?\\n\\nCOOMES. \\'Tis our Hodge, and I think he lies asleep: you made him drunk\\nat your house to-day; but I\\'ll pepper some of you for\\'t.\\n\\nNICH. Ay, Richard, I know you\\'ll put a man over the shoes, and if you\\ncan; but he\\'s a fool will take more than will do him good.\\n\\nCOOMES. \\'Sblood, ye shall take more than will do ye good, or I\\'ll make\\nye clap under the table.\\n\\nNICH. Nay, I hope, as I have temperance to forbear drink, so have I\\npatience to endure drink: I\\'ll do as company doth; for when a man doth\\nto Rome come, he must do as there is done.[285]\\n\\nCOOMES.

Tush, there is no good luck in this delay.\\nCome, come; late-comers, man, are shent.\\n\\nFRAN. Heigho, I fear I shall repent!\\nWell, which way, Philip[292]?\\n\\nPHIL. Why, this way.\\n\\nFRAN.                Canst thou tell,\\nAnd takest upon thee to be my guide to hell?--\\nBut which way, father?\\n\\nMR GOUR.               That way.\\n\\nFRAN. Ay, you know,\\nYou found the way to sorrow long ago.\\nFather, God be wi\\' ye[293]: you have sent your son\\nTo seek on earth an earthly day of doom,\\nWhere I shall be adjudged, alack the ruth,\\nTo penance for the follies of my youth!\\nWell, I must go; but, by my troth, my mind\\nIs not capable to love [in][294] that kind.\\nO, I have look\\'d upon this mould of men,\\nAs I have done upon a lion\\'s den!\\nPraised I have the gallant beast I saw,\\nYet wish\\'d me no acquaintance with his paw:\\nAnd must I now be grated with them? well,\\nYet I may hap to prove a Daniel;\\nAnd, if I do, sure it would make me laugh,\\nTo be among wild beasts and yet be safe.\\nIs there a remedy to abate their rage?\\nYes, many catch them, and put them in a cage.\\nAy, but how catch them? marry, in your hand\\nCarry me forth a burning firebrand,\\nFor with his sparkling shine, old rumour says,\\nA firebrand the swiftest runner frays:\\nThis I may do; but, if it prove not so,\\nThen man goes out to seek his adjunct woe.\\nPhilip, away! and, father, now adieu!\\nIn quest of sorrow I am sent by you.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Return, the messenger of joy, my son.\\n\\nFRAN. Seldom in this world such a work is done.\\n\\nPHIL. Nay, nay, make haste, it will be quickly night.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, is it not good to woo by candle-light?\\n\\nPHIL. But, if we make not haste, they\\'ll be a-bed.\\n\\nFRAN. The better, candles out and curtains spread.\\n\\n                          [_Exeunt_ FRANCIS and PHILIP.]\\n\\nMR GOUR. I know, though that my son\\'s years be not many,\\nYet he hath wit to woo as well as any.\\nHere comes my wife: I am glad my boy is gone.\\n\\n    _Enter_ MISTRESS GOURSEY.\\n\\nEre she came hither. How now, wife? how is\\'t?\\nWhat, are ye yet in charity and love\\nWith Mistress Barnes?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. With Mistress Barnes! why Mistress[295] Barnes, I pray?\\n\\nMR GOUR. Because she is your neighbour and--\\n\\nMRS GOUR. And what?\\nAnd a jealous, slandering, spiteful quean she is,\\nOne that would blur my reputation\\nWith her opprobrious malice, if she could;\\nShe wrongs her husband, to abuse my fame:\\n\\'Tis known that I have lived in honest name\\nAll my lifetime, and been your right true wife.\\n\\nMR GOUR. I entertain no other thought, my wife,\\nAnd my opinion\\'s sound of your behaviour.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. And my behaviour is as sound as it;\\nBut her ill-speeches seeks to rot my credit,\\nAnd eat it with the worm of hate and malice.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Why, then, preserve it you by patience.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. By patience! would ye have me shame myself,\\nAnd cosen myself to bear her injuries?\\nNot while her eyes be open, will I yield\\nA word, a letter, a syllable\\'s value.\\nBut equal and make even her wrongs to me\\nTo her again.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Then, in good faith, wife, ye are more to blame.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Am I to blame, sir? pray, what letter\\'s this?\\n                                  [_Snatches the letter_.]\\n\\nMR GOUR. There is a dearth of manners in ye, wife,\\nRudely to snatch it from me. Give it me.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. You shall not have it, sir, till I have read it.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Give me it, then, and I will read it to you.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. No, no, it shall not need: I am a scholar\\nGood enough to read a letter, sir.\\n\\nMR GOUR. God\\'s passion, if she know but the contents,\\nShe\\'ll seek to cross this match! she shall not read it.    [_Aside_.]\\nWife, give it me; come, come, give it me.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Husband, in very deed, you shall not have it.\\n\\nMR GOUR. What, will you move me to impatience, then?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Tut, tell not me of your impatience;\\nBut since you talk, sir, of impatience,\\nYou shall not have the letter, by this light,\\nTill I have read it; soul, I\\'ll burn it first!\\n\\nMR GOUR. Go to, ye move me, wife; give me the letter;\\nIn troth, I shall grow angry, if you do not.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Grow to the house-top with your anger, sir!\\nNe\\'er tell me, I care not thus much for it.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Well, I can bear enough, but not too much.\\nCome, give it me; \\'twere best you be persuaded;\\nBy God--ye make me swear--now God forgive me!--\\nGive me, I say, and stand not long upon it;\\nGo to, I am angry at the heart, my very heart.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Heart me no hearts! you shall not have it, sir,\\nNo, you shall not; ne\\'er look so big,\\nI will not be afraid at your great looks;\\nYou shall not have it, no, you shall not have it.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Shall I not have it? in troth, I\\'ll try that:\\nMinion, I\\'ll ha\\'\\'t; shall I not ha\\'\\'t?--I am loth--\\nGo to, take pausement, be advis\\'d--\\nIn faith, I will; and stand not long upon it--\\nA woman of your years! I am asham\\'d\\nA couple of so long continuance\\nShould thus--God\\'s foot--I cry God heart\\'ly mercy!--\\nGo to, ye vex me; and I\\'ll vex ye for it;\\nBefore I leave ye, I will make ye glad\\nTo tender it on your knees; hear ye, I will, I will.\\nWhat, worse and worse stomach! true faith,\\nShall I be cross\\'d by you in my old age?\\nAnd where I should have greatest comfort, too,\\nA nurse of you?--nurse in the devil\\'s name!--\\nGo to, mistress; by God\\'s precious deer,\\nIf ye delay--\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Lord, Lord, why, in what a fit\\nAre you in, husband! so enrag\\'d, so mov\\'d,\\nAnd for so slight a cause, to read a letter!\\nDid this letter, love, contain my death,\\nShould you deny my sight of it, I would not\\nNor see my sorrow nor eschew my danger,\\nBut willingly yield me a patient\\nUnto the doom that your displeasure gave.\\nHere is the letter; not for that your incensement\\n                           [_Gives back the letter_.]\\nMakes me make offer of it, but your health,\\nWhich anger, I do fear, hath craz\\'d[296],\\nAnd viper-like hath suck\\'d away the blood\\nThat wont was to be cheerful in this cheek:\\nHow pale ye look!\\n\\nMR GOUR. Pale! Can ye blame me for it? I tell you true,\\nAn easy matter could not thus have moved me.\\nWell, this resignment--and so forth--but, woman,\\nThis fortnight shall I not forget ye for it.--\\nHa, ha, I see that roughness can do somewhat!\\nI did not think, good faith, I could have set\\nSo sour a face upon it, and to her,\\nMy bed-embracer, my right bosom friend.\\nI would not that she should have seen the letter--\\nAs poor a man as I am--by my troth,\\nFor twenty pound: well, I am glad I have it.    [_Aside_.]\\nHa, here\\'s ado about a thing of nothing!\\nWhat, stomach, ha! \\'tis happy you\\'re come down.\\n                                                 [_Exit_.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Well, crafty[297] fox, I\\'ll hunt ye, by my troth,\\nDeal ye so closely! Well, I see his drift:\\nHe would not let me see the letter, lest\\nThat I should cross the match; and I will cross it.\\nDick Coomes!\\n\\n    _Enter_ COOMES.\\n\\nCOOMES. Forsooth.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Come hither, Dick; thou art a man I love,\\nAnd one whom I have much in my regard.\\n\\nCOOMES. I thank ye for it, mistress, I thank ye for it.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Nay, here\\'s my hand, I will do very much\\nFor thee, if e\\'er thou stand\\'st in need of me;\\nThou shalt not lack, whilst thou hast a day to live,\\nMoney, apparel--\\n\\nCOOMES. And sword and bucklers?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. And sword and bucklers too, my gallant Dick,\\nSo thou wilt use but this in my defence.\\n                            [_Pointing to his sword_.]\\n\\nCOOMES. This! no, faith, I have no mind to this; break my head, if this\\nbreak not, if we come to any tough play. Nay, mistress, I had a sword,\\nay, the flower of Smithfield for a sword, a right fox,[298] i\\'faith;\\nwith that, and a man had come over with a smooth and a sharp stroke, it\\nwould have cried twang, and then, when I had doubled my point, trac\\'d my\\nground, and had carried my buckler before me like a garden-butt, and\\nthen come in with a cross blow, and over the pick[299] of his buckler\\ntwo ells long, it would have cried twang, twang, metal, metal: but a\\ndog hath his day; \\'tis gone, and there are few good ones made now. I see\\nby this dearth of good swords, that[300] dearth of sword-and-buckler\\nfight begins to grow out:[301] I am sorry for it; I shall never see\\ngood manhood again, if it be once gone; this poking fight of rapier and\\ndagger will come up then; then a man, a tall[302] man, and a good\\nsword-and-buckler man, will be spitted like a cat or a coney; then a boy\\nwill be as good as a man, unless the Lord show mercy unto us; well, I\\nhad as lief be hang\\'d as live to see that day. Well, mistress, what\\nshall I do? what shall I do?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Why, this, brave Dick.  Thou knowest that Barnes\\'s wife\\nAnd I am foes: now, man me to her house;\\nAnd though it be dark, Dick, yet we\\'ll have no light.\\nLest that thy master should prevent our journey\\nBy seeing our depart. Then, when we come,\\nAnd if that she and I do fall to words,\\nSet in thy foot and quarrel with her men,\\nDraw, fight, strike, hurt, but do not kill the slaves,\\nAnd make as though thou strookest[303] at a man,\\nAnd hit her, and thou canst,--a plague upon her!--\\nShe hath misus\\'d me, Dick: wilt thou do this?\\n\\nCOOMES. Yes, mistress, I will strike her men; but God forbid that e\\'er\\nDick Coomes should be seen to strike a woman!\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Why, she is mankind;[304] therefore thou mayest strike her.\\n\\nCOOMES. Mankind! nay, and she have any part of a man, I\\'ll strike her,\\nI warrant.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. That\\'s my good Dick, that\\'s my sweet Dick!\\n\\nCOOMES. \\'Swouns, who would not be a man of valour to have such words of\\na gentlewoman! one of their words are more to me than twenty of these\\nrusset-coats, cheese-cakes, and butter-makers. Well, I thank God, I am\\nnone of these cowards; well, and a man have any virtue in him, I see he\\nshall be regarded.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Art thou resolved, Dick? wilt thou do this for me?\\nAnd if thou wilt, here is an earnest-penny\\nOf that rich guerdon I do mean to give thee.\\n                                  [_Gives money_.]\\n\\nCOOMES. An angel,[305] mistress! let me see. Stand you on my left hand,\\nand let the angel lie on my buckler on my right hand, for fear of losing.\\nNow, here stand I to be tempted. They say, every man hath two spirits\\nattending on him, either good or bad; now, I say, a man hath no other\\nspirits but either his wealth or his wife: now, which is the better of\\nthem? Why, that is as they are used; for use neither of them well, and\\nthey are both nought. But this is a miracle to me, that gold that is\\nheavy hath the upper, and a woman that is light doth soonest fall,\\nconsidering that light things aspire, and heavy things soonest go down:\\nbut leave these considerations to Sir John;[306] they become a\\nblack-coat better than a blue.[307] Well, mistress, I had no mind to-day\\nto quarrel; but a woman is made to be a man\\'s seducer; you say, quarrel?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Ay.\\n\\nCOOMES. There speaks an angel: is it good?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Ay.\\n\\nCOOMES. Then, I cannot do amiss; the good angel goes with me.\\n\\n                                                        [_Exeunt.\\n\\n    Enter_ SIR RALPH SMITH, _his_ LADY, WILL, [_and_ ATTENDANTS].\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Come on, my hearts: i\\'faith, it is ill-luck,\\nTo hunt all day, and not kill anything.\\nWhat sayest thou, lady? art thou weary yet?\\n\\nLADY. I must not say so, sir.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Although thou art!\\n\\nWILL. And can you blame her, to be forth so long,\\nAnd see no better sport?\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Good faith, \\'twas very hard.\\n\\nLADY. No, \\'twas not ill,\\nBecause, you know, it is not good to kill.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Yes, venison, lady.\\n\\nLADY. No, indeed, nor them;\\nLife is as dear in deer as \\'tis in men.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. But they are kill\\'d for sport.\\n\\nLADY. But that\\'s bad play,\\nWhen they are made to sport their lives away.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. \\'Tis fine to see them run.\\n\\nLADY. What, out of breath?\\nThey run but ill that run themselves to death.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. They might make, then, less haste, and keep their wind.\\n\\nLADY. Why, then, they see the hounds brings death behind.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Then, \\'twere as good for them at first to stay,\\nAs to run long, and run their lives away.\\n\\nLADY. Ay, but the stoutest of you all that\\'s here\\nWould run from death and nimbly scud for fear.\\nNow, by my troth, I pity these poor elves.[308]\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Well, they have made us but bad sport to-day.\\n\\nLADY. Yes, \\'twas my sport to see them \\'scape away.\\n\\nWILL. I wish that I had been at one buck\\'s fall.\\n\\nLADY. Out, thou wood-tyrant! thou art worst of all.\\n\\nWILL. A wood-man,[309] lady, but no tyrant I.\\n\\nLADY. Yes, tyrant-like thou lov\\'st to see lives die.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Lady, no more: I do not like this luck,\\nTo hunt all day, and yet not kill a buck.\\nWell, it is late; but yet I swear I will\\nStay here all night, but I a buck will kill.\\n\\nLADY. All night! nay, good Sir Ralph Smith, do not so.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Content ye, lady. Will, go fetch my bow:\\nA berry[310] of fair roes I saw to-day\\nDown by the groves, and there I\\'ll take my[311] stand,\\nAnd shoot at one--God send a lucky hand!\\n\\nLADY. Will ye not, then, Sir Ralph, go home with me?\\n\\nSIR RALPH. No, but my men shall bear thee company.--\\nSirs, man her home. Will, bid the huntsmen couple,\\nAnd bid them well reward their hounds to-night.--\\nLady, farewell. Will, haste ye with the bow;\\nI\\'ll stay for thee here by the grove below.\\n\\nWILL. I will; but \\'twill be dark, I shall not see:\\nHow shall I see ye, then?\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Why, halloo to me, and I will answer thee.\\n\\nWILL. Enough, I will.\\n\\nSIR RALPH. Farewell.\\n                        [_Exit_.\\n\\nLADY. How willingly dost thou consent to go\\nTo fetch thy master that same killing bow!\\n\\nWILL. Guilty of death I willing am in this,\\nBecause \\'twas our ill-haps to-day to miss:\\nTo hunt, and not to kill, is hunter\\'s sorrow.\\nCome, lady, we\\'ll have venison ere to-morrow.\\n\\n                                           [_Exeunt_.\\n\\n    _Enter_ PHILIP, FRANK [_and_ BOY].\\n\\nPHIL. Come, Frank, now are we hard by the[312] house:\\nBut how now? Sad?\\n\\nFRAN. No, to study how to woo thy sister.\\n\\nPHIL. How, man? how to woo her! why, no matter how;\\nI am sure thou wilt not he ashamed to woo.\\nThy cheeks not subject to a childish blush,\\nThou hast a better warrant by thy wit;\\nI know thy oratory can unfold\\n[A] quick invention, plausible discourse,\\nAnd set such painted beauty on thy tongue,\\nAs it shall ravish every maiden sense;\\nFor, Frank, thou art not like the russet youth\\nI told thee of, that went to woo a wench,\\nAnd being full stuff\\'d up with fallow wit\\nAnd meadow-matter, ask\\'d the pretty maid\\nHow they sold corn last market-day with them,\\nSaying, \"Indeed, \\'twas very dear with [us].\"\\nAnd, do ye hear, ye[313] had not need be so,\\nFor she[314] will, Francis, throughly[315] try your wit;\\nSirrah, she\\'ll bow the metal of your wits,\\nAnd, if they crack, she will not hold ye current;\\nNay, she will weigh your wit, as men weigh angels,[316]\\nAnd, if it lack a grain, she will not change with ye.\\nI cannot speak it but in passion,\\nShe is a wicked wench to make a jest;\\nAh me, how full of flouts and mocks she is!\\n\\nFRAN. Some aqua-vitae reason to recover\\nThis sick discourser! Sound[317] not, prythee, Philip.\\nTush, tush, I do not think her as thou sayest:\\nPerhaps she\\'s[318] opinion\\'s darling, Philip,\\nWise in repute, the crow\\'s bird. O my friend,\\nSome judgments slave themselves to small desert,\\nAnd wondernise the birth of common wit,\\nWhen their own[319] strangeness do but make that strange,\\nAnd their ill errors do but make that good:\\nAnd why should men debase to make that good?\\nPerhaps such admiration wins her wit.\\n\\nPHIL. Well, I am glad to hear this bold prepare\\nFor this encounter. Forward, hardy Frank!\\nYonder\\'s the window with the candle in\\'t;\\nBelike she\\'s putting on her night attire:\\nI told ye, Frank, \\'twas late. Well, I will call her,\\nMarry, softly, that my mother may not hear.\\nMall, sister Mall!\\n\\n    _Enter_ MALL _in the window_.\\n\\nMAL. How now, who\\'s there?\\n\\nPHIL. \\'Tis I.\\n\\nMAL. \\'Tis I! Who I? I, quoth the dog, or what?\\nA Christcross row I?[320]\\n\\nPHIL. No, sweet pinkany.[321]\\n\\nMAL. O, is\\'t you, wild-oats?\\n\\nPHIL. Ay, forsooth, wanton.\\n\\nMAL. Well said, scapethrift.\\n\\nFRAN. Philip, be these your usual best salutes?    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nPHIL. Is this the harmless chiding of that dove?    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nFRAN. Dove! One of those that draw the queen of love?    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMAL. How now? who\\'s that, brother? who\\'s that with ye?\\n\\nPHIL. A gentleman, my friend.\\n\\nMAL. By\\'r lady, he hath a pure wit.\\n\\nFRAN. How meane your holy judgment?\\n\\nMAL. O, well put-in, sir!\\n\\nFRAN. Up, you would say.\\n\\nMAL. Well climb\\'d, gentleman!\\nI pray, sir, tell me, do you cart the queen of love?\\n\\nFRAN. Not cart her, but couch her in your eye,\\nAnd a fit place for gentle love to lie.\\n\\nMAL. Ay, but methinks you speak without the book,\\nTo place a four[322]-wheel waggon in my look:\\nWhere will you have room to have the coachman sit?\\n\\nFRAN. Nay, that were but small manners, and not fit:\\nHis duty is before you bare to stand,\\nHaving a lusty whipstock[323] in his hand.\\n\\nMAL. The place is void; will you provide me one?\\n\\nFRAN. And if you please, I will supply the room.\\n\\nMAL. But are ye cunning in the carman\\'s lash?\\nAnd can ye whistle well?\\n\\nFRAN. Yes, I can well direct the coach of love.\\n\\nMAL. Ah, cruel carter! would you whip a dove?\\n\\nPHIL. Hark ye, sister--\\n\\nMAL. Nay, but hark ye, brother;\\nWhose white boy[324] is that same? know ye his mother?\\n\\nPHIL. He is a gentleman of a good house.\\n\\nMAL. Why, is his house of gold?\\nIs it not made of lime and stone like this?\\n\\nPHIL. I mean he\\'s well-descended.\\n\\nMAL. God be thanked!\\nDid he descend some steeple or some ladder?\\n\\nPHIL. Well, you will still be cross; I tell ye, sister--\\nThis gentleman, by all your friends\\' consent\\nMust be your husband.\\n\\nMAL. Nay, not all, some sing another note;\\nMy mother will say no, I hold a groat.\\nBut I thought \\'twas somewhat, he would be a carter;\\nHe hath been whipping lately some blind bear,\\nAnd now he would ferk the blind boy here with us.\\n\\nPHIL. Well, do you hear, you, sister, mistress [that] would have--\\nYou that do long for somewhat, I know what--\\nMy father told me--go to, I\\'ll tell all,\\nIf ye be cross--do you hear me? I have labour\\'d\\nA year\\'s work in this afternoon for ye:\\nCome from your cloister, votary, chaste nun,\\nCome down and kiss Frank Goursey\\'s mother\\'s son.\\n\\nMAL. Kiss him, I pray?\\n\\nPHIL. Go to, stale maidenhead! come down, I say,\\nYou seventeen and upward, come, come down;\\nYou\\'ll stay till twenty else for your wedding gown.\\n\\nMAL. Nun, votary, stale maidenhead, seventeen and upward!\\nHere be names! what, nothing else?\\n\\nFRAN. Yes, or a fair-built steeple without bells.\\n\\nMAL. Steeple! good people, nay, another cast.\\n\\nFRAN. Ay, or a well-made ship without a mast.\\n\\nMAL. Fie, not so big, sir, by one part of four.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, then, ye are a boat without an oar.\\n\\nMAL. O well row\\'d wit! but what\\'s your fare, I pray?\\n\\nFRAN. Your fair self must be my fairest pay.\\n\\nMAL. Nay, and you be so dear, I\\'ll choose another.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, take your first man, wench, and go no further.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nPHIL. Peace, Francis. Hark ye, sister, this I say:\\nYou know my mind; or answer ay or nay.\\n[Your] wit and judgment hath resolv\\'d his mind,\\nAnd he foresees what after he shall find:\\nIf such discretion, then, shall govern you,\\nVow love to him, he\\'ll do the like to you.\\n\\nMAL. Vow love! who would not love such a comely feature,\\nNor high nor low, but of the middle stature?\\nA middle man, that\\'s the best size indeed;\\nI like him well: love grant us well to speed!\\n\\nFRAN. And let me see a woman of that tallness,\\nSo slender and of such a middle smallness,\\nSo old enough, and in each part so fit,\\nSo fair, so kind, endued with so much wit,\\nOf so much wit as it is held a wonder,\\n\\'Twere pity to keep love and her asunder;\\nTherefore go up, my joy, call down my bliss;\\nBid her come seal the bargain with a kiss.\\n\\nMAL. Frank, Frank, I come through dangers, death, and harms,\\nTo make love\\'s patent[325] with my[326] seal of arms.\\n\\nPHIL. But, sister, softly, lest my mother hear.\\n\\nMAL. Hush, then; mum, mouse in cheese[327], cat is near.\\n                                              [_Exit_ MAL.\\n\\nFRAN. Now, in good faith, Philip, this makes me smile,\\nThat I have wooed and won in so small while.\\n\\nPHIL. Francis, indeed my sister, I dare say.\\nWas not determined to say thee nay;\\nFor this same tother thing, call\\'d maiden-head,\\nHangs by so small a hair or spider\\'s thread,\\nAnd worn so too[328] with time, it must needs fall,\\nAnd, like a well-lur\\'d hawk, she knows her call.\\n\\n    [_Enter_ MALL.]\\n\\nMAL. Whist, brother, whist! my mother heard me tread,\\nAnd ask\\'d, Who\\'s there? I would not answer her;\\nShe call\\'d, A light! and up she\\'s gone to seek me:\\nThere when she finds me not, she\\'ll hither come;\\nTherefore dispatch, let it be quickly done.\\nFrancis, my love\\'s lease I do let to thee,\\nDate of my life and thine: what sayest thou to me?\\nThe ent\\'ring, fine, or income thou must pay,\\nAre kisses and embraces every day;\\nAnd quarterly I must receive my rent;\\nYou know my mind.\\n\\nFRAN. I guess at thy intent:\\nThou shalt not miss a minute of thy time.\\n\\nMAL. Why, then, sweet Francis, I am only thine.--\\nBrother, bear witness.\\n\\nPHIL. Do ye deliver this as your deed?\\n\\nMAL. I do, I do.\\n\\nPHIL. God send ye both good speed!\\nGod\\'s Lord, my mother! Stand aside,\\nAnd closely too, lest that you be espied.\\n\\n    [_Enter_ MISTRESS BARNES.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. Who\\'s there?\\n\\nPHIL. Mother, \\'tis I.\\n\\nMRS BAR. You disobedient ruffian, careless wretch,\\nThat said your father lov\\'d me but too well?\\nI\\'ll think on\\'t, when thou think\\'st I have forgot it:\\nWho\\'s with thee else?--How now, minion? you!\\nWith whom? with him!--Why, what make you here, sir,\\n\\n                    [_Discovers_ FRANCIS _and_ MALL.]\\n\\nAnd thus late too? what, hath your mother sent ye\\nTo cut my throat, that here you be in wait?--\\nCome from him, mistress, and let go his hand.--\\nWill ye not, sir?\\n\\nFRAN. Stay, Mistress Barnes, or mother--what ye will;\\nShe is[329] my wife, and here she shall be still.\\n\\nMRS BAR. How, sir? your wife! wouldst thou my daughter have?\\nI\\'ll rather have her married to her grave.[330]\\nGo to; be gone, and quickly, or I swear\\nI\\'ll have my men beat ye for staying here.\\n\\nPHIL. Beat him, mother! as I am true[331] man,\\nThey were better beat the devil and his dam.\\n\\nMRS BAR. What, wilt thou take his part?\\n\\nPHIL. To do him good,\\nAnd \\'twere to wade hitherto up in blood.\\n\\nFRAN. God-a-mercy, Philip!--But, mother, hear me.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Call\\'st thou me mother? no, thy mother\\'s name\\nCarries about with it reproach and shame.\\nGive me my daughter: ere that she shall wed\\nA strumpet\\'s son, and have her so misled,\\nI\\'ll marry her to a carter; come, I say,\\nGive me her from thee.\\n\\nFRAN. Mother, not to-day,\\nNor yet to-morrow, till my life\\'s last morrow\\nMake me leave that which I with leave did borrow:\\nHere I have borrowed love, I\\'ll not denay[332] it.--\\nThy wedding night\\'s my day, then I\\'ll repay it.--\\nTill then she\\'ll trust me. Wench, is\\'t[333] not so?\\nAnd if it be, say ay, if not, say no.\\n\\nMAL. Mother, good mother, hear me! O good God,\\nNow we are even, what, would you make us odd?\\nNow, I beseech ye, for the love of Christ,\\nTo give me leave once to do what I list.\\nI am as you were, when you were a maid;\\nGuess by yourself how long you would have stay\\'d,\\nMight you have had your will: as good begin\\nAt first as last, it saves us from much sin;\\nLying alone, we muse on things and things,\\nAnd in our minds one thought another brings:\\nThis maid\\'s life, mother, is an idle life,\\nTherefore I\\'ll be, ay, I will be a wife;\\nAnd, mother, do not mistrust[334] my age or power,\\nI am sufficient, I lack ne\\'er an hour;\\nI had both wit to grant, when he did woo me,\\nAnd strength to bear whate\\'er he can do to me.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Well, bold-face, but I mean to make ye stay.\\nGo to, come from him, or I\\'ll make ye come:\\nWill ye not come?\\n\\nPHIL. Mother, I pray, forbear;\\nThis match is for my sister.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Villain, \\'tis not;\\nNor she shall not be so match\\'d now.[335]\\n\\nPHIL. In troth, she shall, and your unruly hate\\nShall not rule us; we\\'ll end all this debate\\nBy this begun device.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, end what you begun! Villains, thieves,\\nGive me my daughter! will ye rob me of her?--\\nHelp, help! they\\'ll rob me here, they\\'ll rob me here!\\n\\n    _Enter_ MASTER BARNES _and his men_.\\n\\nMR BAR. How now? what outcry\\'s here? why, how now, woman?\\n\\nMRS BAR. Why, Goursey\\'s son, confederate[336] with this boy,\\nThis wretch unnatural and undutiful,\\nSeeks hence to steal my daughter: will you suffer it?\\nShall he, that\\'s son to my arch-enemy,\\nEnjoy her? Have I brought her up to this?\\nO God, he shall not have her, no, he shall not!\\n\\nMR BAR. I am sorry she knows it. [_Aside_.]--Hark ye, wife,\\nLet reason moderate your rage a little.\\nIf you examine but his birth and living,\\nHis wit and good behaviour, you will say,\\nThough that ill-hate make your opinion bad,\\nHe doth deserve as good a wife as she.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Why, will you give consent he shall enjoy her?\\n\\nMR BAR. Ay, so that thy mind would agree with mine?\\n\\nMRS BAR. My mind shall ne\\'er agree to this agreement.\\n\\n    _Enter_ MISTRESS GOURSEY _and_ COOMES.[337]\\n\\nMR BAR. And yet it shall go forward:--but who\\'s here?\\nWhat, Mistress Goursey! how knew she of this?\\n\\nPHIL. Frank, thy mother!\\n\\nFRAN. \\'Sowns, where? a plague upon it!\\nI think the devil is set to cross this match.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. This is the house, Dick Coomes, and yonder\\'s [th\\'] light:\\nLet us go near. How now? methinks I see\\nMy son stand hand in hand with Barnes his daughter.\\nWhy, how now, sirrah? is this time of night\\nFor you to be abroad? what have we here?\\nI hope that love hath not thus coupled you.\\n\\nFRAN. Love, by my troth, mother, love: she loves me,\\nAnd I love her; then we must needs agree.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Ay, but I\\'ll keep her sure enough from thee.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. It shall not need, I\\'ll keep him safe enough;\\nBe sure he shall not graft in such a stock.\\n\\nMRS BAR. What stock, forsooth? as good a stock as thine:\\nI do not mean that he shall graft in mine.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Nor shall he, mistress. Hark, boy; th\\'art but mad\\nTo love the branch that hath a root so bad.\\n\\nFRAN. Then, mother, I will graft a pippin on a crab.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. It will not prove well.\\n\\nFRAN. But I will prove my skill.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Sir, but you shall not.\\n\\nFRAN. Mothers both, I will.\\n\\nMR BAR. Hark, Philip: send away thy sister straight;\\nLet Francis meet her where thou shalt appoint;\\nLet them go several to shun suspicion,\\nAnd bid them go to Oxford both this night;\\nThere to-morrow say that we will meet them,\\nAnd there determine of their marriage.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nPHIL. I will: though it be very late and dark.\\nMy sister will endure it for a husband.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMR BAR. Well, then, at Carfax,[338] boy, I mean to meet them.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nPHIL. Enough.    _Exit_ [MASTER BARNES.]\\nWould they would begin to chide!\\nFor I would have them brawling, that meanwhile\\nThey may steal hence, to meet where I appoint it.    [_Aside_.]\\nWhat, mother, will you let this match go forward?\\nOr, Mistress Goursey, will you first agree?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Shall I agree first?\\n\\nPHIL. Ay, why not? come, come.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Come from her, son, and if thou lov\\'st thy mother.\\n\\nMRS BAR. With the like spell, daughter, I conjure thee.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Francis, by fair means let me win thee from her,\\nAnd I will gild my blessing, gentle son,\\nWith store of angels. I would not have thee\\nCheck thy good fortune by this cos\\'ning choice:\\nO, do not thrall thy happy liberty\\nIn such a bondage! if thou\\'lt needs be bound,\\nBe then to better worth; this worthless choice\\nIs not fit for thee.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Is\\'t not fit for him? wherefore is\\'t not fit?\\nIs he too brave[339] a gentleman, I pray?\\nNo, \\'tis not fit; she shall not fit his turn:\\nIf she were wise, she would be fitter for\\nThree times his better. Minion, go in, or I\\'ll make ye;\\nI\\'ll keep ye safe from him, I warrant ye.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Come, Francis, come from her.\\n\\nFRAN. Mothers, with both hands shove I hate from love,\\nThat like an ill-companion would infect\\nThe infant mind of our affection:\\nWithin this cradle shall this minute\\'s babe\\nBe laid to rest; and thus I\\'ll hug my joy.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Wilt thou be obstinate, thou self-will\\'d boy?\\nNay, then, perforce I\\'ll part ye, since ye will not.\\n\\nCOOMES. Do ye hear, mistress? pray ye give me leave to talk two or three\\ncold words with my young master.--Hark ye, sir, ye are my master\\'s son,\\nand so forth; and indeed I bear ye some good-will, partly for his sake,\\nand partly for your own; and I do hope you do the like to me,--I should\\nbe sorry else. I must needs say ye are a young man; and for mine own\\npart, I have seen the world, and I know what belongs to causes, and the\\nexperience that I have, I thank God I have travelled for it.\\n\\nFRAN. Why, how far have ye travell\\'d for it?\\n\\nBOY. From my master\\'s house to the ale-house.\\n\\nCOOMES. How, sir?\\n\\nBOY. So, sir.\\n\\nCOOMES. Go to. I pray, correct your boy; \\'twas ne\\'er a good world, since\\na boy would face a man so.\\n\\nFRAN. Go to. Forward, man.\\n\\nCOOMES. Well, sir, so it is, I would not wish ye to marry without my\\nmistress\\' consent.\\n\\nFRAN. And why?\\n\\nCOOMES. Nay, there\\'s ne\\'er a why but there is a wherefore; I have\\nknown some have done the like, and they have danc\\'d a galliard at\\nbeggars\\'-bush[340] for it.\\n\\nBOY. At beggars\\'-bush! Hear him no more, master; he doth bedaub ye with\\nhis dirty speech. Do ye hear, sir? how far stands beggars\\'-bush from\\nyour father\\'s house, sir? Why, thou whoreson refuge[341] of a tailor,\\nthat wert \\'prentice to a tailor half an age, and because, if thou hadst\\nserved ten ages thou wouldst prove but a botcher, thou leapst from the\\nshop-board to a blue coat, doth it become thee to use thy terms so?\\nwell, thou degree above a hackney, and ten degrees under a page, sew up\\nyour lubber lips, or \\'tis not your sword and buckler shall keep my\\nponiard from your breast.\\n\\nCOOMES. Do ye hear, sir? this is your boy.\\n\\nFRAN. How then?\\n\\nCOOMES. You must breech him for it.\\n\\nFRAN. Must I? how, if I will not?\\n\\nCOOMES. Why, then, \\'tis a fine world, when boys keep boys, and know not\\nhow to use them.\\n\\nFRAN. Boy, ye rascal!\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Strike him, and thou darest.\\n\\nCOOMES. Strike me? alas, he were better strike his father! Sowns, go to,\\nput up your bodkin.[342]\\n\\nFRAN. Mother, stand by; I\\'ll teach that rascal--\\n\\nCOOMES. Go to, give me good words, or, by God\\'s dines,[343] I\\'ll buckle\\nye for all your bird-spit.\\n\\nFRAN. Will you so, sir?\\n\\nPHIL. Stay, Frank, this pitch of frenzy will defile thee;\\nMeddle not with it: thy unreproved valour\\nShould be high-minded; couch it not so low.\\nDost hear me? take occasion to slip hence,\\nBut secretly, let not thy mother see thee:\\nAt the back-side there is a coney-green;[344]\\nStay there for me, and Mall and I will come to thee.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nFRAN. Enough, I will [_Aside_.] Mother, you do me wrong\\nTo be so peremptory in your command,\\nAnd see that rascal to abuse me so.\\n\\nCOOMES. Rascal! take that and take all! Do ye hear, sir? I do not mean\\nto pocket up this wrong.\\n\\nBoy. I know why that is.\\n\\nCOOMES. Why?\\n\\nBoy. Because you have ne\\'er a pocket.\\n\\nCOM. A whip, sirrah, a whip! But, sir, provide your tools against\\nto-morrow morning; \\'tis somewhat dark now, indeed: you know Dawson\\'s\\nclose, between the hedge and the pond; \\'tis good even ground; I\\'ll meet\\nyou there; and I do not, call me cut;[345] and you be a man, show\\nyourself a man; we\\'ll have a bout or two; and so we\\'ll part for that\\npresent.\\n\\nFRAN. Well, sir, well.\\n\\nNICH. Boy, have they appointed to fight?\\n\\nBOY. Ay, Nicholas; wilt not thou go see the fray?\\n\\nNICH. No, indeed; even as they brew, so let them bake. I will not thrust\\nmy hand into the flame, and [I] need not; \\'tis not good to have an oar\\nin another man\\'s boat; little said is soon amended, and in little\\nmeddling cometh great rest; \\'tis good sleeping in a whole skin; so a man\\nmight come home by Weeping-Cross:[346] no, by lady, a friend is not so\\nsoon gotten as lost; blessed are the peace-makers; they that strike with\\nthe sword, shall be beaten with the scabbard.\\n\\nPHIL. Well-said, Proverbs: ne\\'er another to that purpose?\\n\\nNICH. Yes, I could have said to you, sir, Take heed is a good reed.[347]\\n\\nPHIL. Why to me, take heed?\\n\\nNICH. For happy is he whom other men\\'s harms do make to beware.\\n\\nPHIL. O, beware, Frank! Slip away, Mall, you know what I told ye. I\\'ll\\nhold our mothers both in talk meanwhile.    [_Aside_.]\\nMother and Mistress Barnes, methinks you should not stand in hatred so\\nhard one with another.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Should I not, sir? should I not hate a harlot,\\nThat robs me of my right, vild[348] boy?\\n\\nMRS GOUR. That title I return unto thy teeth,\\n                          [_Exeunt_ FRANCIS _and_ MALL.\\nAnd spit the name of harlot in thy face.\\n\\nMRS BAR. Well, \\'tis not time of night to hold out chat\\nWith such a scold as thou art; therefore now\\nThink that I hate thee, as I do the devil.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. The devil take thee, if thou dost not, wretch!\\n\\nMRS BAR. Out upon thee, strumpet!\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Out upon thee, harlot!\\n\\nMRS BAR. Well, I will find a time to be reveng\\'d:\\nMeantime I\\'ll keep my daughter from thy son.--\\nWhere are ye, minion? how now, are ye gone?\\n\\nPHIL. She went in, mother.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Francis, where are ye?\\n\\nMRS BAR. He is not here. O, then, they slipp\\'d away,\\nAnd both together!\\n\\nPHIL. I\\'ll assure ye, no:\\nMy sister she went in--into the house.\\n\\nMRS BAR. But then she\\'ll out again at the back door,\\nAnd meet with him: but I will search about\\nAll these same fields and paths near to my house:\\nThey are not far, I am sure, if I make haste.\\n                                                 [_Exit_.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. O God, how went he hence, I did not see him?\\nIt was when Barnes\\'s wife did scold with me;\\nA plague on[349] her!--Dick, why didst not thou look to him?\\n\\nCOOMES. What should I look for him? no, no.\\nI look not for him while[350] to-morrow morning.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Come, go with me to help me look him out.\\nAlas! I have nor light, nor link, nor torch!\\nThough it be dark, I will take any pains\\nTo cross this match. I prithee, Dick, away.\\n\\nCOOMES. Mistress, because I brought ye out, I\\'ll bring ye home; but,\\nif I should follow, so he might have the law on his side.\\n\\nMRS GOUR. Come, \\'tis no matter; prythee, go with me.\\n\\n                     _Exeunt_ [MRS GOURSEY _and_ COOMES.]\\n\\nMR BAR. Philip, thy mother\\'s gone to seek thy sister,\\nAnd in a rage, i\\'faith: but who comes here?\\n\\nPHIL. Old Master Goursey, as I think, \\'tis he.\\n\\nMR BAR. \\'Tis so, indeed.\\n\\n    [_Enter_ MASTER GOURSEY.]\\n\\nMR GOUR. Who\\'s there?\\n\\nMR BAR. A friend of yours.\\n\\nMR GOUR. What, Master Barnes! did ye not see my wife?\\n\\nMR BAR. Yes, sir, I saw her; she was here even now.\\n\\nMR GOUR. I doubted that; that made me come unto you:\\nBut whither is she gone?\\n\\nPHIL. To seek your son, who slipp\\'d away from her\\nTo meet with Mall my sister in a place,\\nWhere I appointed; and my mother too\\nSeeks for my sister; so they both are gone:\\nMy mother hath a torch; marry, your wife\\nGoes darkling up and down, and Coomes before her.\\n\\nMR GOUR. I thought that knave was with her; but \\'tis well:\\nI pray God, they may come by ne\\'er a light,\\nBut both be led a dark dance in the night!\\n\\nHOD. Why, is my fellow, Dick, in the dark with my mistress? I pray God,\\nthey be honest, for there may be much knavery in the dark: faith, if I\\nwere there, I would have some knavery with them.    [_Aside_]\\nGood master, will ye carry the torch yourself, and give me leave to play\\nat blind-man-buff with my mistress.\\n\\nPHIL. On that condition thou wilt do thy best\\nTo keep thy mistress and thy fellow, Dick,\\nBoth from my sister and thy master\\'s son,\\nI will entreat thy master let thee go.\\n\\nHOD. O, ay, I warrant ye, I\\'ll have fine tricks to cosen them.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Well, sir, then, go your ways; I give you leave.\\n\\nHOD. O brave! but whereabout are they?\\n\\nPHIL. About our coney-green they surely are,\\nIf thou canst find them.\\n\\nHOD. O, let me alone to grope for cunnies.\\n                                         [_Exit_.\\n\\nPHIL. Well, now will I to Frank and to my sister.\\nStand you two heark\\'ning near the coney-green;\\nBut sure your light in you must not be seen;\\nOr else let Nicholas stand afar off with it,\\nAnd as his life keep it from Mistress Goursey.\\nShall this be done?\\n\\nMR BAR. Philip, it shall.\\n\\nPHIL. God be with ye! I\\'ll be gone.\\n                                       [_Exit_.\\n\\nMR BAR. Come on, Master Goursey: this same is a means\\nTo make our wives friends, if they resist not.\\n\\nMR GOUR. Tut, sir, howsoever, it shall go forward.\\n\\nMR BAR. Come, then, let\\'s do as Philip hath advis\\'d.\\n\\n                                            [_Exeunt_.\\n\\n    _Enter_ MALL.\\n\\nMAL. Here is the place where Philip bad me stay,\\nTill Francis came; but wherefore did my brother\\nAppoint it here? why in the coney-burrow?\\nHe had some meaning in\\'t, I warrant ye.\\nWell, here I\\'ll set me down under this tree,\\nAnd think upon the matter all alone.\\nGood Lord, what pretty things these conies are!\\nHow finely they do feed till they be fat,\\nAnd then what a sweet meat a coney is!\\nAnd what smooth skins they have, both black and gray!\\nThey say they run more in the night than day:\\nWhat is the reason? mark; why in the light\\nThey see more passengers than in the night;\\nFor harmful men many a hay[351] do set,\\nAnd laugh to see them tumble in the net;\\nAnd they put ferrets in the holes--fie, fie!--\\nAnd they go up and down where conies lie;\\nAnd they lie still, they have so little wit:\\nI marvel the warrener will suffer it;\\nNay, nay, they are so bad, that they themselves\\nDo give consent to catch these pretty elves.\\nHow if the warrener should spy me here?\\nHe would take me for a coney, I dare swear.\\nBut when that Francis comes, what will he say?\\n\"Look, boy, there lies a coney in my way!\"\\nBut, soft, a light! who\\'s that? soul, my mother!\\nNay, then, all-hid[352]: i\\'faith, she shall not see me;\\nI\\'ll play bo-peep with her behind this tree.\\n\\n    [_Enter_ MISTRESS BARNES.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. I marvel where this wench doth[353] hide herself\\nSo closely; I have search\\'d in many a bush.\\n\\nMAL. Belike my mother took me for a thrush.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. She\\'s hid in this same warren, I\\'ll lay money.\\n\\nMAL. Close as a rabbit-sucker[354] from an old coney.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. O God, I would to God that I could find her!\\nI would keep her from her love\\'s toys yet.\\n\\nMAL. Ay, so you might, if your daughter had no wit.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. What a vild[355] girl \\'tis, that would hav\\'t so young!\\n\\nMAL. A murrain take that dissembling tongue!\\nEre your calf\\'s teeth were out, you thought it long.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. But, minion, yet I\\'ll keep you from the man.\\n\\nMAL. To save a lie, mother, say, if you can.    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. Well, now to look for her.\\n\\nMAL. Ay, there\\'s the spite:\\nWhat trick shall I now have to \\'scape her light?    [_Aside_.]\\n\\nMRS BAR. Who\\'s there? what, minion, is it you?--\\nBeshrew her heart, what a fright she put me to!\\nBut I am glad I found her, though I was afraid.    [_Aside_.]\\nCome on your ways; you are[356] a handsome maid!\\nWhy [steal] you forth a-doors so late at night?\\nWhy, whither go ye? come, stand still, I say.\\n\\nMA'"
