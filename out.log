from the face of the earth to make way for the green, gray, and brown
vegetation of the summer.

[Illustration: THE BEE-PASTURES OF CALIFORNIA.]

The bee-pastures of the Sierra, though less extensive, are more
regularly and beautifully developed than those of the plain. They are
composed of the same species, but in greater numbers, and with greater
variety of color and form, and, like the plain, they are more or less
distinctly divided into zones, or belts, by the higher mountains,
valleys, and rivers, which divide the foot-hills.

The bee-pastures of the Sierra, as far as I have observed them, are
divided into three main zones, each of which extends from the foot-hills
to the summits of the mountains. The first, or lower, zone, extends from
the foot-hills to the base of the Sierra, and is generally composed of

determined to do my best, and that I did. I studied the part until two
o'clock in the morning, and then turned in and went to sleep. I was
awakened at ten o'clock, and dressed and went to the theater. The
rehearsal was in full blast. The orchestra had not yet arrived, but the
pianist had. The stage was occupied by Buntline and the clerks, who were
busily engaged in the copying of the parts, and in the distribution of
the scenery. The stage was very dark, and I could see nothing. I could
hear Buntline shouting at the clerks to hurry up with the parts, and
threatening to whip them if they did not work faster. I could hear
Buntline giving the clerks orders to move this or that scene, and it was
very evident that he was giving them a lot of trouble.

I had not yet been introduced to Buntline, but I soon discovered that he
was a very nervous, excitable man, and that he had a great deal

~The Great Tope of the Mahavira~


In the country of Ceylon there is a vihara called the Mahavira-vihara.
When Fa-hien was there, the king had a tope erected, which was called
Mahavira, and which was more than a hundred cubits high. At the foot of
it, there was a small vihara, where monks resided, and where there was
an image of Buddha, more than twenty cubits in height.

retarding the earth's rotation by the very small amount of 0.000000000000001
per annum. Now, if the polar ice has been, for the whole of the Glacial
epoch, 100,000 feet thicker than it has been for the whole of the
Miocene epoch, the difference between the two rates of rotation would be
100,000 feet in 100,000,000 years, or 1/1000000000 of an inch per annum.

CHAPTER XXII.

THE CAPTURE OF THE PRESIDENT.


In the month of November, 1861, the North was in the throes of the
preparations for the great campaign of the spring. The President,
McClellan, was in Washington, and the whole country was in a fever of
excitement. The army was in splendid condition. The volunteers were
coming in by tens of thousands every day. The navy was being reconstructed
and reorganized. The war department was in the hands of men of ability
and experience. The press was in the hands of patriotic men, who, in
their eagerness to aid the government, were willing to sacrifice
themselves. The country was in a fever of expectation. The great army
was to be in the field, and the great war-chief in command.

It was in the midst of this exultant preparation that the Confederacy
was struck by a blow that staggered it. The President, Davis, had been

upwards of two hundred skeletons, most of them in a state of perfect

The spirit yearns to soar; and when the earth,

Is differing, for it hath no proper object.
And so from love, the cause of all things, all
Things tend to love; and all things love to love.
But to the other, which is not yet

Therefore the third is lov'd of love, and so
By love, as love is lov'd of love, and love of love.

As loving love, is the true love, which is kind

consequence of a certain disease; and the physician, by observing the
course of the disease, and the time it has continued, has been enabled to

In the last century, the 20th of April was observed by the physicians of
Germany as a fatal day to the human species. On this day in 1710, the
great plague broke out at Marseilles, and, in 1740, it began in
Brescia, and spread from thence over the whole of Italy. In 1750, the

June was a month of golden sunshine, when the lilies came into bloom,

In July, the sunny days were hot, and the flowers had withered away, and
the bees were flying from flower to flower with anxious haste, storing
away their honey and pollen, and preparing to retire for the winter.

perfectly at home with his part, and thought he could act it well. We
both went to work with a will, and by ten o'clock next morning, we were
all ready for the rehearsal.

That evening, after a hard day's work, I found myself feeling rather
"fagged," but I determined to go to the theater. The house was crowded,
and I was introduced to the audience as "Buffalo Bill." I was very much
amazed to see that I was a great favorite with the audience, who were all
anxious to see and hear me. I was also introduced to the company, and
they all seemed to be very much pleased with me. The rehearsal was

actors. The play was entitled "The Scouts of the Plains," and was
written by Buntline, who also had a leading part. The story was
interesting, and I was sure that it would be a success.

CHAPTER XL

~After Two Years Fa-hien Takes Ship for China~


After he had been in the country two years, he took a large merchant
vessel, and, with the wind in his favor, went floating over the sea
towards the east. When he was in the country of Singhala, he saw a
vessel of the same size, which had come from China, with its dragon
flag flying. He also saw the two persons who had come from China, and
heard them talk with one another. When they saw him, they were delighted
to hear him speak their own language, and to be able to converse with
him. They told him that they had been to China, and had come back to
Singhala. They also told him that the king of the country had been

al retardation has
been, during that time, diminishing by one-tenth of a second per year.
Hence, the earth has been rotating, during the whole of the Glacial epoch
and since, quicker than it rotated during the Miocene epoch.

Now, the Miocene epoch was a time of very considerable warmth; and if the
earth has been rotating quicker during the Glacial epoch, the inference
is forced upon us that the earth must have been rotating quicker during
the Miocene epoch. And, therefore, the calculation of Sir W. Thomson
leads to the conclusion that the earth has been rotating quicker,
throughout the whole of the Glacial epoch, than it rotated during the
Miocene epoch; and that, therefore, the earth has been rotating quicker
during the Glacial epoch than it rotated during the Miocene epoch.

I do not mean to say that the above reasoning is fallacious. On the
contrary, it is mathematically correct, and, therefore, I do not see why
it should not be accepted as a proof that the earth has been rotating

children, and the mother had no fear of their union. Dick was not only
an honorable man, but a brave one, and a man who had passed through
danger for the sake of the Atterbury family.

Jack was a sort of brother-in-law, and a man of good family, but the
family could not give him a wife. That would be a marriage of
inferiority. But Dick was a soldier, a man of honor, and a man of
property. He had come into a fortune of twenty thousand dollars by his
father's death. He had a pension from the government, and he had a
future. His parents were rich, and he was a man of parts. She could
only give him a _dot_ of a hundred thousand dollars. But she would give
it, and she would give him Rosa.

The young girl was now the mistress of the house. She had taken the
management of the place into her own hands, and Jack, Dick, and the
servants were her humble servants. She had given her heart to the
soldier, and she was determined to make him happy. He had been a
comrade and a friend, and she

Zack, looking up from his plate, and with a sort of shudder.

"Yes, that's so," agreed his wife. "We're not a-carin' to get into
trouble. We're a-doin' well enough as we are. We're a-doin' mighty well
as we are, Zack."

Johnnie looked at the woman and at her husband. Zack Peavey was a
strapping, good-looking fellow, but his wife had a hard, set face.

"I reckon you've got a good deal of sense, Mrs. Peavey," Johnnie
ventured. "I was thinkin' that maybe you'd know how we could get some
information about the young man that was lost."

The woman glanced uneasily at her husband, who was eating with his eyes
on his plate.

"We're a-doin' mighty well as we are," she repeated, with a sort of
fretful emphasis.

"We're a-doin' mighty well as we are," echoed Zack, looking up. "We're

the most interesting and important discovery has been made in the
cemetery of St. Stephen. The cemetery is in the midst of the field, and
the entrance to it is from a road which leads to the tombs of the
Christian martyrs.

"In the midst of the field, on the left of the road, is a large mound,
which was opened last week. The cemetery is said to have been in use from
the second to the fifth century, and to have been used by the followers of
St. Stephen, whose basilica was near. It is said to have been in use
till the fifth century, and to have been used by the followers of St.
Stephen. It is of great extent, and contains tombs of various styles.

"The mound was found to be of a solid construction, and was opened by
digging a large trench around it. A stone was found at the bottom of the
trench, which was inscribed with a cross, and on the other side was a
figure of a lamb with a cross. The trench was then continued, and at the
depth of six feet the mound was found to be of a solid construction.

Crewe has a certain amount of influence at the Home Office. He is the

the case was brought before a jury, it might be decided against me, and
then I should be in a position where I should have to resign my seat in

Either way, it would be a disaster.

Crewe comes to see you. If he does, you must tell me what he wants.

The boar went out and cried to his brothers, "Why do you call me now?"

"Take Half-a-Cock out of the treasure-room, for it has one of my hairs,
which it puts into the fire. If you don't rescue Half-a-Cock, it will burn
my hair and I don't want to smell the odor of burning hair while I am

His brothers came immediately, killed all the people in the treasure-room,
and rescued Half-a-Cock. The next day the King found his palace
deserted, his people killed, and his treasure-room empty. He was so
furious that he nearly strangled. He looked for Half-a-Cock to kill it with
his own hands. He searched for it a long time without finding it, and
finally went home to rest. At sunset Half-a-Cock came to his usual place and
began to crow. The King called his <DW64>s and said to them:

sunbeams began to play on the wet ground, making the gullies and
hollows glow with glorious color.

The storm was now at its height. I was thoroughly soaked, but
delightfully warm, and had a good dinner of bread and tea, and lay down
for a nap. How long I slept I do not know, but I was awakened by the
wind blowing with less violence, and the sunbeams were streaming through
the trees, and the rain had ceased. I then began to make my way down the
hillside to the valley. The ground was still so wet and slippery that I
had to be cautious, but the storm had left me in a good humor, and I
made a fine study of the trees. The Sugar Pines were in full bloom,
their tassels glowing like gold in the sunshine, and the air was full of

had been treated by the Indians.

We found Mrs. Weichel's hands tied behind her back, and her feet tied
together with a rope. She was in a pitiable condition, but not seriously
wounded. We took her into camp, and when the troops returned from the
pursuit, she was taken to Fort McPherson and given every attention by
the officers and soldiers.

The Pawnees had killed the Indians, and scalped them, and had taken all
their plunder. They had also killed two squaws, and scalped them, and
were now in the village looking for more scalps. They had killed and
scalped about twenty of the Indians, and were not satisfied until they had
killed every one that they could find. They were very revengeful, and
their hatred of the Sioux was greater than that of the regular soldiers
for the same enemy.

After we had gone through the village, and killed and scalped the

The Boy jumped up, and ran to the fireplace. The Colonel, Salmon P.,

Kaviak, still with the Christmas-tree, sat in a row on the buffalo

"Stir the fire!" said Dillon again.

"I'm doing it," said the Boy, and began to blow.

"No, you're not. You're blowing the fire out."

"Well, I'll put on more wood."

"Don't bother."

"But we can't see the gold without--"

"That's just it. _We_ can't see it without a light, but we can't have
a light without a fire. There's a way to get round that difficulty."

"How?"

"We'll see."

  How love can be the cause of sinful pleasure."

"If I am not," I said, "beyond the scope

Requires three powers of intellect and will;

  There must be threefold power of intellect and will.

shelter. The thunder crashed and the lightning played among the pines,
and the rain fell in a torrent.

Then Shalah told me what he had seen.

"The men below are the ones we seek. They are not Cherokees, but a
people of the north. They are the men who will attack the Tidewater,
and they are now on the march. It is a great army, and they will be
here in a day or two. I think we are safe for the moment, but if they
find us here they will have us, for we cannot hold the stockade against
them. I think they will not find us, for they will be too busy with
their own affairs. But we must be very cautious, for they are clever
fellows and will be on the watch."

right, there were many monasteries, with a
multitude of monks, who might be counted by myriads. In this country
there were many trees, bearing the fruit called Ma-t'aou-lo, which is
about the size of an orange, and has a pleasant taste. When they were
ripe, the monks of the monasteries made their offerings, and ate them
with a sauce of sugar.

Going forward from this for thirty days, they came to the kingdom of
Nagara, where there are a multitude of monasteries, with a multitude of
monks, who might be counted by myriads. The common people of the country
all wear the hair of the head shaved, and use the three garments of the
monk. The men are all of a tawny complexion, and the women are very
handsome. The kingdom is a very large one, and has the name of
Nagara-Vihara. It is bounded on the east by the country of Ma-t'aou-lo,
and on the west by the country of Tak-kia. The people of the country are
all students of the mahayana.

us by Redi--the question of
Xenogenesis--I am not prepared to say that the results of modern
researches justify us in rejecting his hypothesis.

In the first place, the hypothesis of Xenogenesis is a perfectly
legitimate one, and, in the absence of any positive evidence to the
contrary, I do not see that it can be excluded from the category of
scientific hypotheses.

Secondly, the facts upon which it rests are, in some respects,
sufficiently curious to justify the hope that they may, some day, be
explained in a manner which shall not be inconsistent with the
hypothesis.

Thirdly, the theory of Xenogenesis, if true, would lead to the most
important practical results.

In the first place, it is by no means certain that the hypothesis of
Xenogenesis is a legitimate one.

The word Xenogenesis is employed to denote the production of something
foreign, or out of the ordinary course of nature; but in the
application of the term to the production of living things, the word
foreign is ambiguous, and

arehouses and the city. He had been
advised to keep in the city as much as possible, so as to be near the
prison, and he was not to quit the town without giving the signal agreed
upon--a small white flag, a handkerchief, or anything that would show
from the prison windows.

The signal was to be given at the first sound of the reveille, when the
prisoners were called to breakfast. Then, if he were not there, the
party was to wait until he came, for he had been seen to be in the
streets at that hour. One morning, as he was walking on the hillside
overlooking the prison, he heard a voice, with a familiar inflection,
cry:

"Hello, there! Barney Moore!"

He turned, and saw a man in a soldier's uniform coming up the hill
toward him.

"I'm blessed if I don't believe it's old Barney Moore himself," the
stranger cried, in a high-pitched voice. "Why, Barney, what are you

yet with eyes that grew wide of a sudden and fierce of aspect.

messire, and what think ye of Sir Pertolepe's gentle hospitality? I
would I had seen thee fight, messire, for methinks thou art a very

"I'll go on to the Hardwickses and see Johnnie," Stoddard said to
himself, as he set the letter in his pocket. "I'll go on and see Johnnie
first."

The Hardwicks lived in a big house, set well back from the street, with
a broad lawn, and a driveway leading up to it. The door was opened by
the butler, who was not accustomed to being spoken to by young men on
horseback, and who looked rather surprised when Stoddard asked for Miss
Sessions.

"I think she is still in her room, sir," he said, with a slight
emphasis on the "sir."

"Then I'll go up and see her," Stoddard returned. "I'll wait in the
hall."

He left his horse at the curb and went up the broad stair. He had never
before been in the Hardwick house, and the grandeur of the place struck
him with a sort of dull wonder. He was not used to such surroundings.

He heard voices in the front room, and went in. A girl was playing
