 with ca ution . I would rather say that we must start with a clear 
 real isation of the impos s ibility of any complete answer to the 
 problem . 
 
 It is only in the last few years that the science of compar ative 
 ps ych ology has begun to be applied to the study of the human mind , and 
 the results of these investig ations are still so incomplete that 
 there is little possibility of dec iding definitely upon the problem of 
 sex ual differences . It is necessary to remember that the study of the 
 bra in is a very recent science , and that even now we are only at the 
 begin ning of our knowledge of the brain . The brain is the organ of 
 mind , and we must not forget that the mind is the most complex of all 
 the organ ic structures . We have to remember that the mind is the 
 result of the interaction of the brain with the body , and , further , 
 that it is only the mind of the adult that has been studied . 
 
 The complexity of the problem is greatly increased by the fact that 
 the sexual differences are not conf ined to the brain , but they extend

 that the first is the work of a man of the second class .  That is

 supp oses to be now in operation , to the period represented by the oldest

 he has done so . 
 
 If he had been asked , he would , I think , have said , that he did not see 
 any reason why the action of these forces should not have been in 
 operation for in defin ite periods , and that he did not , therefore , see any

 I have known an actor who , in a part which required some very 
 h ero ic resolution , had not courage to act it with the proper firm ness 
 of tone and manner . He had a way of looking about him , as if he were 
 half afraid that somebody would see him , which was a little too 
 exp licit , and bet rayed his conscious ness of his own weak ness . He 
 was , in fact , a cow ard , though not a very bad actor . I have seen him 
 play the character of a man of the world , and in the highest degree 
 of self - pos session , with a sort of sc rup ul ous attention to the 
 public eye , as if he were afraid that somebody might be watching 
 him , and detect him in the hyp oc ris y .
