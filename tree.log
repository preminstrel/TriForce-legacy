W ild Sports of the West ," " The Sh adow of the Sea ," " The 
 M is cell aneous Po ems ," and " The F ug itive Le aves " are by phys icians . 
 
 The most famous of the modern phys ician - po ets , however , is Oliver 
 W end ell Hol mes , who has been the most pro l ific of the American po ets , 
 and has written with the most of the simplicity of the old - f ashion ed 
 English po ets . 
 
 In his " Po ems ," published in  1 8 5 5 , Hol mes made the first appearance of 
 his peculiar ly American style . It is a style of the most simple and 
 natural , and is not the least remarkable for its absence of all 
 con vent ional ism and affect ation . It is a style which is like the 
 con vers ation of the New England country people , and which is full of 
 that curious ly old - f ashion ed and qu aint phrase ology which is often 
 found in the writ ings of the country people of England . 
 
 In his " Po ems " the poet showed the influence of his medical studies . 
 The volume is full of the most tender and human sympathy with the
